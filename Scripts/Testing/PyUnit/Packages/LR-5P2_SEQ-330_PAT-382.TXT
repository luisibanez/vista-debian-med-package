Description:
============

 LR*5.2*382 is exported as part of the VistA Blood Establishment 
 Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.6.0 release and supports the Bar
 Code Expansion (BCE) Positive Patient Identification project.
  
 *********************************************************************** 
 WARNING! The HL7 version listed for the VAFC ADT-Axx SERVER protocols 
 must be verified prior to installation. Refer to the Pre Installation 
 Steps listed below for more information.

 *********************************************************************** 
  
 VBECS related VistA patches require customer validation in local 
 Test accounts prior to installation in Production to meet Food & 
 Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the 
 Blood Bank software for its intended use prior to its acceptance 
 and use for patient care.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OIT Field Operations coordinate 
 the installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & 
 Laboratory Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact 
 analysis and testing the changes prior to installation in Production. 
  
 This patch contains the components necessary to transmit patient 
 information, within ADT HL7 messages to VBECS. VBECS must be installed 
 prior to installing this patch.
  
 Included in this patch are the following seven PROTOCOL file (#101) 
 entries:
  
   VBECS-A01 CLIENT
   VBECS-A02 CLIENT
   VBECS-A03 CLIENT
   VBECS-A04 CLIENT
   VBECS-A11 CLIENT
   VBECS-A12 CLIENT
   VBECS-A13 CLIENT
  
 The patch creates and attaches each of the VBECS ADT CLIENT protocols to 
 the corresponding VAFC ADT SERVER protocol to which the Lab ADT interface 
 subscribes:
 - VBECS ADT-A01 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A01 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A02 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A02 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A03 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A03 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A04 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A11 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A11 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A12 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A12 SERVER 
   protocol 
 - VBECS ADT-A13 CLIENT protocol will subscribe to VAFC ADT-A13 SERVER 
   protocol 
  
 This patch removes the VBECS ADT-A08 ROUTER protocol from the VAFC 
 ADT-A08 SERVER protocol and subscribes the existing VBECS-A08 CLIENT 
 protocol to the following server protocols:
  
   VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER
   VAFC ADT-A08-SCHED SERVER
   VAFC ADT-A08-SDAM SERVER
   VAFC ADT-A08-TSP SERVER
  
 Each of these protocols are invoked when a patient movement event 
 (ADT -Admission/Discharge/Transfer) is triggered and will transmit 
 the corresponding HL7 ADT message to VBECS using the CLIENT/SERVER 
 protocol pair associated with the ADT event.
  
 LR*5.2*382 contains a post-install routine, LR382A, that runs during 
 the patch installation. If the installation is queued for a later date, 
 the post-install routine will run in the background at the time the 
 queued installation occurs.
  
 There is also a VBECS 1.6.0 server update patch that is also being 
 released. Please refer to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer 
 Software (VBECS) 1.6.0 Release Notes for detailed information 
 about corrections in that patch. These documents will be found in 
 the VBECS_1_6_0_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE: 
 =====================
  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*382 does not 
  contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined in
  BBM TEAM REVIEW OF VISTA PATCHES.
  
  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*382 does not 
  alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
  elements functions.
  
  RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*382 have no effect on Blood 
  Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none. 
  
  VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
  made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
  installation of this patch.

 Sites that have already installed VBECS in test or production must 
 obtain the LR*5.2*382, and VBECS 1.6.0 patches from 
 the controlled VBECS software FTP site at: 
      IP: 10.3.9.181
      Port: 20001

 Before installing LR*5.2*382:
     1) Use the Fileman search provided in the SEARCH EXAMPLE section 
 below 
        to list these protocols that must be reviewed: 
        - VAFC ADT-A01 SERVER 
        - VAFC ADT-A02 SERVER 
        - VAFC ADT-A03 SERVER 
        - VAFC ADT-A04 SERVER

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
     1) Retrieve the KIDS build for patch LR*5.2*382.
     2) Follow the instructions in the PRE INSTALLATION STEPS section.
     3) Shut down the VBECSPTU link. 
         Use HL7 Main Menu/ Filer and Link Management Options:
         Select OPTION NAME: SL     Start/Stop Links
         Start/Stop Links
  
         EXAMPLE:
         ========
         This option is used to launch the lower level protocol for the 
         appropriate device. Please select the node with which you want
         to communicate.
  
         Select HL LOGICAL LINK NODE: VBECSPTU  
         The LLP was last started on MAR 03, 2009 09:00:29.
  
         Okay to shut down this job? YES
         The job for the VBECSPTU Lower Level Protocol will be shut down. 
  
     4) On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS), 
        select the 'Installation' menu.
     5) Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option on the KIDS Installation
        menu. The Host File name is LR_5_2_382.KID Answer YES to the
        question: Want to Continue with Load? YES// 
     6) From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*382). 
        a) Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        b) Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
     7) Use the Install Package(s) option and at the INSTALL NAME prompt,
        enter LR*5.2*382.
     8) At the "Enter the Coordinator for Mail Group 
        'LRADT INTERFACE ADMIN'" prompt, enter the name of the individual 
        responsible for maintaining the VBECS package and interfaces 
        [typically the Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator 
        (ADPAC) responsible for the Blood Bank]. This mail group receives 
        notifications when an HL7 transmission or query through the VBECS 
        VistALink client to the Blood Bank medical device fails. Add 
        individual users to this mail group after the installation of the 
        LR*5.2*382 patch.
     9) When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
        NO//'  respond NO
    10) When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
        and Protocols? NO//'  respond NO.
    11) After LR*5.2*382 is installed the VBECSPTU outbound HL7 link must
        be started before any ADT messages will be sent.
  
         Use HL7 Main Menu/ Filer and Link Management Options:
         Select OPTION NAME: HL START       Start/Stop Links
         Start/Stop Links
  
         EXAMPLE:
         ========
