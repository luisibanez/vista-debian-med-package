Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28. CPRS GUI
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID,
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID.
 These five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28. CPRS v28 will follow
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
        
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
        
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported
 as OR_380_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
    
 Installation and set-up information specific to OR*3*280 is included in
 "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation Guide".
        
 Patch information:
 PSS patches exported as two host files support CPRS v28 functionality.
 PSS_1_142.KID
 PSS_1_151.KID
    
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID includes the required patches needed to support CPRS
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3.0*293
 GMRC*3.0*66
 GMRA*4.0*45
       
 OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID includes the CPRS, Pharmacy and Clinical Reminders
 patches required for CPRS GUI v28.  It includes builds for the following
 patches:
 OR*3.0*280
 PSJ*5.0*226
 PXRM*2.0*16
        
 CPRS28_RELATED.KID includes the related patches needed to support CPRS
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 GMRC*3.0*64
 GMTS*2.7*90
 OR*3.0*337
          
 Installation of these five host files should be coordinated among the
 packages affected because these host files will install the software
 needed to implement CPRS GUI v28.
    
 This patch contains enhancements to the Consults/Request Tracking 
 software in support of CPRS GUI v28.  Functional items included in this
 release are as follows:
  
 This patch addresses several issues in Computerized Patient Record
 System(CPRS)-Consults.
     
 1. Addresses a problem when the value of the ATTENTION field
 is retained but not presented to the user even after a Consult has been
 forwarded. The provider who receives the forwarded Consult may mistakenly
 believe the forwarded Consult is being managed by the person identified in
 the original ATTENTION field.
  
 2. This patch prevents Consults that have a status of partial
 results (PR) as well as those with unsigned or uncosigned notes from being
 forwarded to a new service.
  
 3. This patch corrects the lock in GMRCGUIA which was missing a
 time out value.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000195099 - ATTENTION LINE does not remove upon FORWARD
                       PSPO #735
  
 2.  HD0000000212226   Consult was FORWARDED with an UNSIGNED TIU document
                       PSPO #879
  
 3.  HD0000000317551   Lock Missing Timeout
  
 Problem #1:
 --------
 When a Consult Request is forwarded, the ATTENTION value is retained 
 but is not presented to the user so that they can change the value, if 
 needed.  The provider receiving the forwarded Consult Request may think
 the person identified in the ATTENTION field is managing the consult
 when they may not be.  This could cause a delay or lack of patient care.  
  
 The PSI Workgroup has recommended that the original ATTENTION line be 
 displayed as information to the user forwarding the Consult.  The user can
 then edit the value if they feel it is appropriate. If the ATTENTION value
 is modified, an audit of the previous ATTENTION value should be 
 maintained.  NOTE:  CPRS V28 will display the original ATTENTION value to
 the user in the CPRS GUI.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the Help-Prompt and Description of the data dictionary entry for
 the PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO (#7) field of the REQUEST PROCESSING ACTIVITY
 (#40) subfile of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file to be used to store
 the previous ATTENTION (#7) field of the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file.
        
 The routine GMRCGUIB was modified to use the variable GMRCATTN to store the 
 PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO field (#7) of the REQUEST CONSULTATION FILE (#123).  
 This field will be cleared on a forward request so the user can change
 the value to the new user.
                
 The routine GMRCGUIA was modified to add variables GMRCPA and GMRCSEQ to 
 store the PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO field (#7) of the REQUEST CONSULTATION
 FILE (#123).  This information will display on the Details Section of
 the Consult Order in CPRS.
     
 The routine GMRCAFRD was modified to add variables GMRCACT and 
 GMRCSE to store the PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO field (#7) of the REQUEST
 CONSULTATION FILE (#123).  This information will display on the Details
 Section of the Consult Order Screen in CPRS.
     
 The routine GMRCSLM4 was modified to add the variable GMRC3LN to display
 the PREVIOUS ATTENTION TO value in the Details section of the Consult 
 Order in CPRS.

 Before Patch GMRC*3*64:
 123.02,7        PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO 0;7 POINTER TO NEW PERSON FILE (#200)
  
                 LAST EDITED:    DEC 08, 1991 
                 HELP-PROMPT:    Enter the name of the provider who was 
                                 previously assigned this consult. 
                 DESCRIPTION:
                                 This field is not used in this version.
  
  
 After Patch GMRC*3*64:
 123.02,7        PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO 0;7 POINTER TO NEW PERSON FILE (#200)
  
                 LAST EDITED:    MAY 19, 2010 
                 HELP-PROMPT:    Enter the name of the provider who was the 
                                 previous attention value assigned on this 
                                 consult. 
                 DESCRIPTION:    This is the provider who was previously
                                 identified in the ATTENTION (#7) field of the
                                 REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file.
  
 Problem #2:
 --------
 In CPRS GUI, the user is able to forward a "pr" consult, but in
 CPRS Vista the user is not allowed to forward "pr" consults.
 In addition, users are able to forward consults with unsigned or 
 uncosigned notes regardless of the status of the consult.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify FR^GMRCGUIA to prevent "pr" status consults from being 
 forwarded in GUI.  Modify FR^GMRCAFRD to prevent unsigned and uncosigned 
 notes from being forwarded to a new service.  
  
 Problem #3:
 ----------
 Routine ^XINDEX identified instances where a time out was not used when 
 locking REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -------------
 Added a time out and an error message in routine NEW^GMRCGUIA when 
 locking the REQUEST/CONSULTATION (#123) file to create a new consult.
