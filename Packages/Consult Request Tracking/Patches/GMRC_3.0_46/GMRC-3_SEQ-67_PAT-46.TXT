Subject: USER RECEIVING ALERT INAPPROPRIATELY, LOCK ISSUE & TYPO

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch prevents alerts being sent to the user performing the action 
 that generated the alert.  It also corrects a missing timeout on a Lock
 command and a typographical error in a message displayed to the user.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000188126 - Some alerts still being sent to user taking action
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Consult alerts are being sent back to the user taking the action in
    some situations.  Since the user is aware of the action taken, he/she
    should not receive an alert.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The recipients of consult alerts, which are directly determined by the
    CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING package, will not include the user taking the
    action.  This will not, however, prevent the user from receiving an
    alert due to settings in the Notifications system which are outside the
    control of the CONSULT/REQUEST TRACKING software.
  
 2. HD0000000305723 - Lock missing Timeout
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was determined that two of the routines involved in the solution to
    issue number one (above) contained Lock commands without a time out value
    set. Since missing locks are a violation of the SAC standards, this 
    change has to be implemented.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines GMRCR and GMRCHL7B have been modified to add a time out to the
    Lock commands within them that did not already contain a time out value.
  
 3. HD0000000312729 - Message contains typo.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option Determine users' update authority [GMRC UPDATE AUTHORITY],
    generates the following message if the user is an administrative and an
    update user: "This user is both and administrative and update user for:"
    The first "and" should be "an" in that message.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine GMRCAU was modified to correct this issue.  The message will now
    read: "This user is both an administrative and update user"
