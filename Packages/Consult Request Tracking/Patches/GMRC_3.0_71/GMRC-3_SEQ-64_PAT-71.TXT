Subject: FORWARD TO TRACKING ONLY SERVICE/CHANGE TO SERVICE USAGE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 items:
  
 1. In CPRS GUI, users can forward to a tracking only service when they 
    have update authority at the parent level.  However, when using CPRS
    List Manager in VistA, users cannot forward to a tracking only service
    when they have update authority at the parent level.
  
 2. When users change the SERVICE USAGE of a Consult Service to 'Grouper 
    Only' or 'Disabled', they are not warned when there are any RELATED 
    SERVICES tied to the Consult Service.
  
 3. The Consult/Request Tracking Technical Manual and the Consult/Result
    Tracking User Manual do not state that the alert CONSULT/REQUEST
    UPDATED is sent when a consult is scheduled.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000202541 - Forwarding access different in GUI vs. List Manager
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In CPRS List Manager, a user is unable to forward to a Tracking Only 
    service if they do not have Administrative Update User access at the 
    tracking service level.  In CPRS GUI, a user may forward to a Tracking 
    Only service if they do not have Administrative Update User access at 
    the tracking service level.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine GMRCASV to call VALID^GMRCAU so that the parent levels
    are checked to see if the user can forward to a tracking service.
  
  
 2. HD0000000067401 - BAC-0401-40350  Message received after GMRC*3*15
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users are not warned when they change a Consult Service to a Grouper or
    Disabled if there are any RELATED SERVICES tied to the Consult Service.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Add a check to file REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5), field SERVICE USAGE to 
    display a warning message to the user if they change a Consult Service
    to be Disabled or Grouper Only when there are RELATED SERVICES
    attached.
  
 3. HD0000000323526 - Update Consult Documents for CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATE
                      alert
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Consult documents Consult/Request Tracking Technical Manual and 
    Consult/Result Tracking User Manual do not state that the alert 
    CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED is sent when a "schedule" or "add comment"
    action is taken on the consult.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Update the manuals to state the alert CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED is also 
    triggered by the "schedule" or "add comment" actions.
