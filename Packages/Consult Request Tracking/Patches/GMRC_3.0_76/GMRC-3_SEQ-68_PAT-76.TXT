Subject: Consult Performance Rpt/Group Update Alerts

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects the following 2 issues:
  
 1) The wording in the description for the GMRC RPT PERF MON report. 
  
 2) The addition of clarification wording for the Group Update function of
 Consult Alerts. The clarification wording addresses Patient Safety Issue 
 (PSPO #2198). The Consults Technical Manual will also need to be updated.

 2.  INC000000604090 - Group update of consults not sending notifications

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1.  INC000000498496 - Option consults performance monitor report
    
 Problem:
 -------
 The Consults Performance Monitor report (GMRC RPT PERF MON) needs to be 
 changed.  The report will now use EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE in place of
 DATE OF REQUEST when calculating if requests are completed within the 30
 and 60 day date ranges.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change DATE OF REQUEST to read EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE on the
 GMRC RPT PERF MON report in program GMRCSTL7.
     
 2.  INC000000604090 - Group update of consults not sending notifications
                       to ordering providers.
       
 Patient Safety Issue:
 --------------------
 PSPO 2198
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A misconception of how notifications were sent when using the 
 Group Update options of Consults resulted in PSPO #2198.  Users
 believed notifications were being sent to Ordering Providers.
 Online HELP and the Consults Technical Manual were not clear 
 on the behavior of notifications when using the Group Update
 option.
            
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The following verbiage has been inserted into program GMRCSTS which
 displays a message when using the Group Update function of Consults:
  
 When using the Group Update functionality, the Ordering Provider will NOT 
 receive an alert when a consult or request is updated online to a 
 "completed" or "discontinued" status by the specialty service personnel. 
 The original clinical who requested the order is notified electronically 
 of the order's resolution.
  
 This has also been added to the Consults Technical Manual.
  
      
 This is a PSI issue (PSPO2198)
  
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
  
  Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from the 
      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext
  
      The documentation distribution includes: 
  
      File Name                   Description              Retrieval Format
      =========                   ===========              ================
      CONSTM.PDF                  Tech Manual              Binary
  
  
  (3) Once released, documentation may be retrieved from VISTA
      Documentation Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address:
      http://www.domain.ext/vdl
