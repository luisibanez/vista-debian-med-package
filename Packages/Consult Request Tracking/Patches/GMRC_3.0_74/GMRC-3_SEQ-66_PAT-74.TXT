Description:
============

 THIS PATCH IS REQUIRED FOR PATCH DSIF*3.2*23
  
 This patch creates a new Consult parameter and edit option to be added
 to the Consult Management [GMRC MGR] menu so that sites may define Fee
 consult services that need to interface with the Fee Basis Claims System
 (FBCS) and Healthcare Claims Processing (HCP) applications.
  
 NOTE:  Coordination between the Consult Clinical Coordinator and the Fee 
 Basis department is crucial, please identify your counterpart and work 
 with them so that both sides understand what is being put in place and 
 when that has been completed so that the Fee Basis department can verify 
 the new functionality.  
  
 Enhancements
 ============
  
 1. Created new parameter, GMRC FEE SERVICES file (#8989.51) , which will 
    store a list of IENs defined in the REQUEST SERVICES (#123.5) file.
    This constitutes a list of consult services defined as Non VA Care.
  
 2. Created new menu option, Define Fee Services [GMRC FEE PARAM], which 
    will manage the GMRC FEE SERVICES parameter..
  
 3. Added the Define Fee Services [GMRC FEE PARAM] Option to the Consult
    Management [GMRC MGR] Menu Option.
  
 4. Created GMRC FEE PARAM List Template file(#409.61) with associated 
    Protocols file (#101)
      GMRC FEE PARAM ADD
      GMRC FEE PARAM MENU

 20100117 - Expanded Fee Pilot - CPRS Integration
 Non-VA care services are initiated by VA providers as a component of
 Veterans health care services. Having an automated link from CPRS, where
 the initial requests are entered, to the Referral and Authorization
 System (RAS), can assure more timely care for Veterans. In addition, VA
 providers frequently have no insight into when non-VA care is scheduled,
 provided and completed. Integration from RAS to CPRS can serve to update
 VA providers on patient status.
