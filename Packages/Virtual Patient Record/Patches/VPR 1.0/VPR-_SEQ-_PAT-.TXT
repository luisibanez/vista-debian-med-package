Subject: VIRTUAL PATIENT RECORD

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 The new Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package will enable extraction of 
 patient health data from VistA into an Extensible Markup Language (XML)
 document, for use in new web applications and to share with other federal
 and private sector providers.  Some of this code was previously released 
 as part of the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) project.
  
 This release of VPR 1.0 will load 22 routines and add the following file 
 entries:
  
     VPR APPLICATION PROXY to the OPTION file (#19),
     VPR DATA VERSION to the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994),
     VPR GET PATIENT DATA to the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994).
  
 The post-install routine will create a new proxy user in the New Person
 file #200 called VPR,APPLICATION PROXY.
