Description:
============

 This patch to the Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package provides a new
 remote procedure call (RPC) to enable extraction of patient health data
 from a Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture
 (VistA) database in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, for use in
 new web applications such as the Health Management Platform (HMP).  This
 patch will also correct a reported issue with VPR 1.0.

 Remedy Tickets & Issues
 =======================
  
 1. HD0000000719354  NwHIN Uncosigned Notes
  
 Issue:
 -----
 Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) uses the VPR data extract
 RPC to request completed documents from VistA, but VPR is getting all
 signed notes from Text Integration Utilities (TIU); notes also needing a
 cosignature to be complete are included and returned in the resulting
 VPR XML document.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A filter will be added to the VPR documents extract, and notes that
 still require a cosignature will no longer be included in the results
 for complete documents. [Note: NwHIN added a similar filter to their
 Adapter v5 client, released in September 2012, so users of that
 application may not see any change with this patch.]
   
   
 2. [no Remedy#]     New Data Extract RPC
  
 Issue:
 -----
 New web applications in development, such as HMP, need VistA data
 returned in the JSON format.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch adds VPR GET PATIENT DATA JSON to the REMOTE PROCEDURE file
 (#8994), and new routines to support it.  Data is pulled from VistA
 applications in the same way as the previously released RPC, but the
 results are formatted as JSON instead of XML.
  
 An option to allow viewing the JSON results is also included in this
 patch.  The View JSON results option [VPR TEST JSON] may be assigned
 to users who desire or need to see the raw results of this RPC; the input
 parameters will be prompted for and passed into the RPC, and the results
 displayed onscreen.
