Subject: RPC UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Virtual Patient Record (VPR) package provides a remote procedure call 
 (RPC) to enable extraction of patient health data from a Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) database into an 
 Extensible Markup Language (XML) document.  This patch will correct two 
 reported issues with VPR 1.0, and make additional data domains available:
  * Clinical Observations (CLiO)
  * Clinical Procedures
  * Inpatient Medications (complex orders)
  * Insurance (from Integrated Billing)
  * PCE Exams, Patient Education, and Skin Tests
  * Womens Health Pregnancy Log, returned as a condition with the Problem 
 List if the patient is currently pregnant
  
  
 Patch Components
 ================
 This patch consists of routines only; eighteen existing routines are 
 updated and seven new ones are added.

 Remedy Tickets & Issues
 =======================
  
 1. HD0000000592277  Non-VA Medications in NwHIN
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) is looking for only active 
 medications from VistA, but because non-VA medications are not filled by 
 VA a status was not being returned for those; screening by status=active 
 was preventing non-VA medications from displaying.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 A status will be determined and returned with each non-VA medication.
  
  
 2. [no Remedy#]     Vital Sign units
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The VistA Vitals application does not save a unit with some measurements, 
 but NwHIN requires an appropriate unit of measure.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 VPR will now populate the units with the appropriate value, when Vitals 
 does not explicitly return the assumed value.
