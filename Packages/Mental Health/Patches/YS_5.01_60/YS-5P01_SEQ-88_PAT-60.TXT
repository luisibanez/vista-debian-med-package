Description:
============

  
 This is a multiple build and is distributed as a Host File System (HFS)
 file.  It comprises YS*5.01*60 (Mental Health Patch 60) and GMTS*2.7*102 
 (Health Summary Patch 102).
  
 Please refer to the patch description for Health Summary patch 
 GMTS*2.7*102 for technical information and documentation retrieval.
  
 Patch YS*5.01*60 removes the ability to add new records to the MEDICAL
 RECORD file (#90), which the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary
 component used.  This is controlled by DBIA 1280.  GMTS*2.7*102 disables
 the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary component.  The code for
 this obsolete component was located in the routine GMTSMHPE, which is in
 GMTS*2.7*102.
  
 YS*5.01*60 Description:
 =======================
 Patch YS*5.01*60 addresses the retirement of Mental Health options, files,
 data dictionaries, data associated with these files, and associated 
 templates. These were determined by the Mental Health Strategic Healthcare
 Group to be obsolete and are no longer supported by Health Systems Design
 and Development.  All the software, files, options, and templates were
 deprecated in 2004 or earlier.
  
 The retirement of the Mental Health Assistant 2 (MHA2) is also performed 
 by this patch.  This old interface does not use the required national 
 reporting system and does not have the required error checking found in 
 MHA3.  In order to move all field activity to MHA3, an analysis was
 performed by clinical and technical staff to determine the necessary 
 software changes. The following Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) are exported
 with REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994), INACTIVE field (#.06) set to INACTIVE:
    YTAPI CLERK RESPONSES
    YTAPI GET INCOMPLETE
    YTAPI LIST INCOMPLETES
    YTAPI LISTALL
    YTAPI LISTONE
    YTAPI OUTNOTE
    YTAPI PREVIEW
    YTAPI PRIVLEGE
    YTAPI QUEST
    YTAPI SAVE INCOMPLETES
    YTAPI SAVE TEST COMMENT
    YTAPI SAVEIT
    YTAPI SCOREIT
    YTAPI SHOWALL
    YTAPI SHOWIT
    YTAPI TEST BATTERY
    YTAPI TEST BULLETIN
   
 This patch also includes updates to routines which reference the deleted 
 files, plus routines which did not meet the Standards and Conventions 
 Committee (SACC) guidelines.
  
 The pre-init will check for outdated entries in the following two files 
 and delete them. The count of deleted entries will be displayed for each
 file.
  
    Some sites have residual data in the MH SCALEGROUPS file (#601.86);
    the faulty entries have SCALEGROUPNAME equal to "RPCBroker1".
  
    The MH SCALES file (#601.87) may have entries with residual data; 
    the faulty entries have SCALE NAME equal to "R1 Scale".
  
 One print template, YSJOB, is deleted. YSJOB is associated with the JOB
 BANK file (#624).
  
 One input template, YSCEN UNIT DEF, is deleted. YSCEN UNIT DEF is
 associated with the MENTAL HEALTH CENSUS file (#618).
   
 One protocol, YS PATIENT MOVEMENT, is deleted. The text for this protocol
 is "MHS PATIENT MOVEMENT".
  
 One help frame, YS-PHY-EXAM-NORM, is updated. The header for this help
 frame is "IS THE PHYSICAL EXAM NORMAL".  It was invoked by the YSPHY
 routine, which is deleted by this patch.  The INVOKED BY ROUTINE
 relationship has been removed. 
  
 The post-init will check the entries in the MH REPORT file (#601.93)
 and remove any control characters.
  
 The following data dictionaries and their data are deleted by the routines
 YS60PRE and YS60POST using the supported VA FileMan API EN^DIU2.

       Global: ^YSA(602)
   2. MH TEXT (#605)
       Global: ^YTX
   3. JOB BANK (#624)
       Global: ^YSG("JOB")
      The data for this file is copied into the ^XTMP("YS*5.01*60") global
      with an expiration date of 90 days. After that, the data will be
      deleted from the ^XTMP global.
   4. DSM CONVERSION (#627.99)
       Global: ^YSD(627.99)
   5. YSEXPERT (#628)
       Global: ^YS(628)

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  
  *** NOTE: DO NOT QUEUE THE INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH. ***
            You are prompted for some information during the install
            process.
  
    1. Use the 'LOAD A DISTRIBUTION' option. 
       The Host File name is YS_501_60.KID.
     
    2. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.
       [Optional] On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the
       following options:
   
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Backup a Transport Global
   
    3. Users may remain on the system, but installation should be done
       at off-peak hours.
   
    4. Installation will take less than ten minutes
       (rebuilding the Menu Trees will add to this, see note below).
  
    5. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the option
       'Install Package(s)' and enter YS*5.01*60. 
       Proceed with the installation.
   
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//', respond NO.
  
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? 
       NO//, respond NO
  
       Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? YES//,
       respond YES
   
 When prompted 'When rebuilding the Health Summary Adhoc Report, do you
 want to include disabled components? ', respond with either YES to include
 disabled components or NO to exclude disabled components.
  
 If prompted 'Select the recipient(s) of the report below. Send mail to: ',
 respond with the recipients or mail groups to send the PATCH GMTS*2.7*102
 REPORT to; as a courtesy, the installer should include the site's local
 clinical application coordinators (CACs).
  
 Also, the rebuilding of Menu Trees is recommended since menu options are
 deleted. Rebuilding the Menu Trees will increase the time needed to
 install this build.  It is recommended that the rebuilding be done at
 installation, unless your site policy prohibits this.  If you choose to
 not rebuild the Menu Trees immediately then it should be queued to run at
 the earliest opportunity.
  
 The installation feedback listed below is an example.  The text displayed 
 at your site WILL differ.
