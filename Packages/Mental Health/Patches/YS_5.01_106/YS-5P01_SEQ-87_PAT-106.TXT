Description:
============

 Mental Health Patch YS*5.01*106 addresses the requirements to terminate 
 Health Level 7 data transmissions due to the imminent shutdown of the
 Mental Health national database in Pittsburgh, PA, which was a repository
 for the results of many Mental Health Assistant (MHA) instruments and
 other Mental Health data.
  
 This patch will end the transmission of data to Pittsburgh. This activity
 is being taken over by the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). Transmission of
 data from the administration of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was
 being done via MailMan; this patch will terminate this message traffic.
  
 The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) uses a Web address that will no
 longer be available; this patch will update that address.
  
 This patch stops the generation of messages for the YS MHAT logical link.
 It does not end GAF transmissions.
  
 The automatic generation of MailMan messages by the deletion of the
 results of MHA instrument administrations is no longer required and will 
 be ended by this patch.
  
 In addition to changed routines, four options are deleted with this patch.
 These options supported the obsolete HL7 functionality and are no longer
 functional.
  
 The options are:
  MHA3 HL7 Utilities             [YTQ HL7 UTILITIES]
  HL7 Check                      [YTQ HL7 CHECK]
  Re-Send individual HL7 Message [YTQ HL7 SEND1]
  Re-Queue ASI Roll Up           [YSAS ASI REQUE]
  
 This patch also corrects a misspelling in the MH ADMINISTRATIONS file
 (#601.84) for the name of field #12. It has been changed from "TRANSMISION
 TIME" to "TRANSMISSION TIME".
