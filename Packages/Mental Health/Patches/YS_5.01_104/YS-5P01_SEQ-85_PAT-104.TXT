Subject: Defect with GUI in patch YS*5.01*96

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Patch YS*5.01*96 was released nationally on March 10, 2011. A couple of weeks
 later two problems were reported. 
 
 
 Problem 1
 A few sites have reported a "List out of bounds" error when entering data on
 the MBMD instrument (Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic). This instrument
 contains 165 questions. No other instruments in the Mental Health Assistant
 (MHA3) were found to have problems.
 
 Resolution:
 The problem was caused by the identification of the first question in the
 instrument as having a Question IEN of 146 instead of Question IEN 1046.
 This was a error in the Delphi code and was easily remedied.
 
 
 Problem 2:
 Reports of the administrations of mental health instruments that were entered
 via the roll-and-scroll version of the Mental Health Package (MHA2); were not
 being displayed in the Mental Health Assistant (MHA3) Instrument Results Review.
 The date and the name of the instrument are listed among the administered tests
 for a given veteran, but when the user attempts to view the report of a MHA2
 test, the user would see the GUI error dialog "This administration was not saved
 properly; the identification number is missing in file 601.84"
 
 Resolution:
 An error catching routine in MHA3 would not display instruments that did not
 have an administrative IEN. The MHA2 administrations are not saved with
 administrative IENS but they are identified by date, instrument and patient
 ID's. The correction to this problem is to display the results of
 administrations with and without administrative IENs.
 
 Because these issues were found within 30 days of the release of patch
 YS*5.01*96, it is possible to offer a rapid response to correcting these
 issues by releasing a new executable for MHA3.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 
 After downloading the YS_501_104_SETUP.EXE from the FTP site to a temporary
 directory, run the executable by double clicking on it. It will install the
 four files in their proper directories on a workstation.
 
 If an application server is used, the two files, YS_MHA.exe and borlndmm.dll,
 should be located in the directory that the CPRS Tools menu, line command
 points to. 
 
 The two files YS_MHA_AUX.dll and YS_MHA_A.dll should be placed on each
 workstation that uses CPRS in this directory: C:\Program Files\Vista
 \Common Files. If Patch YS*5.01*96 has been installed already, this
 step can be skipped.    
 
 The YS_501_104_SETUP.EXE application will place the files in the following
 locations.
 
 YS_MHA.EXE           C:\Program Files\Vista\YS\MHA3
 YS_MHA_AUX.DLL       C:\Program Files\Vista\Common files
 YS_MHA_A.DLL         C:\Program Files\Vista\Common files
 Borlndmm.DLL         C:\Program Files\Vista\YS\MHA3
