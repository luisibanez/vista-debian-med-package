Description:
============

 The Outcomes Monitoring (OM) project's main focus in this patch is to add 
 new instruments to the Mental Health Assistant (MHA). Outcomes Monitoring 
 refers to the evaluation of the treatment provided patients in the
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These new instruments will help
 clinicians and administrators analyze the effectiveness of treatment, help
 clarify diagnoses and provide empirical measures for treatment outcomes.

 (GUIs) to determine if the GUI software invoked by the user is current.

   Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
   =============================
   PSPO 2299 - The scoring for the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) instrument
 is causing confusion. There are 21 questions each with 4 choice numbers
 ranging from 1 to 4. Some users who score it by hand count the choice
 number as the score (i.e., choice 1 is worth 1 point and so on). However,
 the score is the choice number minus 1 (i.e., choice 1 is worth no points,
 choice 2 is worth 1 point and so on).
  
 With this patch, the report for the BAI will clearly document the
 patient's answers and their point value.
