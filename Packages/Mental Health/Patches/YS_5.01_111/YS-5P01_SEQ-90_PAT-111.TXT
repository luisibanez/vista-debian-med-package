 The utilization of the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL v5.2) COTS software is

 This patch announces availability of the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL v5.2) 
 COTS software and its associated interface to VistA. 
  
 The BHL Software is a flexible and user-friendly tool designed to 
 facilitate the delivery of measurement based behavioral health care. The 
 software supports Primary Care - Mental Health Integration programs by 
 providing customizable decision support, patient tracking tools and 
 structured assessments to monitor patient symptoms and inform treatment 
 decisions. The installation and usage of this software is at the

 Integration (PCMHI) providers or ACOS Mental Health).

 certified to run on workstations running Windows XP and Windows 7. The
 BHL's interface to VistA is based on the RPC Broker and the usage of
