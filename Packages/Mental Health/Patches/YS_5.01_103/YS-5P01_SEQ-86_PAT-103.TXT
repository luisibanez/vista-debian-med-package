Description:
============

 The Outcomes Monitoring (OM) project's main focus in Patch YS*5.01*103 is
 to add new instruments to the Mental Health Assistant (MHA3) and make two 
 previously retired instruments (i.e., Revised NEO Personality Inventory 
 and Personality Assessment Inventory) operational again. Outcomes
 Monitoring refers to the evaluation of the treatment provided patients in
 the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These new instruments will help
 clinicians and administrators analyze the effectiveness of treatment, help
 clarify diagnoses and provide empirical measures for treatment outcomes.
  
   New Mental Health Instruments:
   ==============================
   ASSIST - Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test
   BAM - Brief Addiction Monitor
   BASIS-24 - Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale
   CDR - Clinical Dementia Rating
   CIWA-AR - Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment - Alcohol Revised
   COWS - Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale
   FAST - Functional Assessment Staging
   GAD 7 - Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 7 items
   GDS - Geriatric Depression Scale
   GDS DEMENTIA - Global Deterioration Scale
   INDEX OF ADL - Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living
   ISMI - Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory
   NEOPI - Revised NEO Personality Inventory
   PAI - Personality Assessment Inventory 
   PCL-SZ - PTSD Checklist Stressor Specific
   POQ - Pain Outcomes Questionnaire
   SBR - Suicide Behavior Report
   SLUMS - Saint Louis University Mental Status Examination
   WAI-SR - Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised 
   WHYMPI - West Haven-Yale Multiphasic Pain Inventory
   ZBI SCREEN - Zarit Burden Interview: Screening version
   ZBI SHORT - Zarit Burden Interview: Short version
  
  
 NEW features in Mental Health Assistant (MHA3):
 ---------------------------------------------------
 Ability to create a Text Integration Utility (TIU) note containing the
 results of the instrument administered to the patient and linking it to a
 consult for that patient.
  
 Improved screen navigation within the MHA3. Near the upper left portion
 of several screens (e.g., Instrument Administrator), there is now a white
 arrow surrounded by a green circle. When the user clicks on this arrow,
 the software will go back to the Main Menu. Prior to this patch, the user
 had to exit the window and go back to the Main Menu.
  
 Additional User Preferences are added. The user can define what menu the
 MHA3 will start with. Prior to this patch, MHA3 always started with
 the Main Menu. With this patch, the default is the 'Main Menu', but the user
 can select a different starting point such as 'Instrument Administrator'.
  
 A new tab labeled 'Special Results' is added to the 'Instrument Review
 Results' screen. This tab presents summary data of instruments important
 to the clinician such as depression scores over time. The user has the
 ability to pick and choose the instruments that will appear on the display.
  
 Ability to print a blank instrument form from within the MHA3. Prior to
 this patch, the user had to print a blank form from the 'roll and scroll' 
 interface. This new functionality makes it easier for the Mental Health user 
 to give a patient a hardcopy of the instrument to fill out at his/her leisure.
 However, some instruments require the user to have the YSP security key.
 They are:
  
  AUIR - Alcohol Use Inventory (Revised)
  BSI18 - Brief Symptom Inventory 18
  HLOC - Health Locus of Control Scale
  IEQ - Rotter Internal-External Scale
  MBMD - Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic
  MCMI2 - Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II
  MCMI3 - Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III
  MHLA - Multidimensional Health Locus of Control: Form A
  MHLB - Multidimensional Health Locus of Control: Form B
  MMP2S - MMPI 2 Short Form
  MMPI2 - Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2
  NEOPI - Revised NEO Personality Inventory
  PAI - Personality Assessment Inventory
  RLOC - Rotter Locus of Control
  SCL9R - Symptom Checklist-90-Revised
  STAI - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory

   In MH DISPLAY file (#601.88) COMPONENT field (#11), 2 additional choice
   types were added to the "Set of Codes". This allows the Mental Health
   GUI to handle two additional types of components. The additions are as
   follows:
  
   'OS' FOR Staff combo; 
   'OC' FOR Consultation combo;
  
   The field definition now looks as follows:

                                 'RA' FOR RadioGroup;

   Associated Remedy Tickets:
   ==========================
   493289 - This ticket requests two new instruments; WAI-SR and WHOQUL, 
   be added to the Mental Health Assistant. The WAI-SR instrument is 
   one of the new instruments added by this patch. The WHOQUL instrument 
   will be handled as a New Service Request (NSR). If approved, the WHOQUL 
   instrument will be added in a future patch. This ticket will remain
   open.
  
   508930 - The Instrument Description option under the Help menu of the 
   Instrument Administrator of the MHA was inactive (i.e., gray). When 
   invoked, nothing happened. With this patch the option is active and will
   display the description of any instrument that is highlighted. 
  
   526957 - Prior to this patch, opening an incomplete administration was 
   restricted. With this patch, any user can open an incomplete 
   administration. 
  
   586235 - When the last question on the MMPI2 instrument was not
   answered, the MHA considered the instrument incomplete no matter what
   the user did. This patch allows the user to skip the last question and
   save the instrument as completed.

    PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    ==============================
  
    Create the progress note title "MENTAL HEALTH CONSULT NOTE"
    (without quotes) under the PROGRESS NOTES | CONSULTS hierarchy. If 
    this note title already exists, do not create another one.
   
    This patch adds a new field, CONSULT NOTE TITLE (#30), to the MH 
    TESTS AND SURVEYS (#601.71) file. This field is a pointer to the TIU 
    DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) file. This patch exports the entries in 
    FILE 601.71 with the CONSULT NOTE TITLE field filled in with this note
    title.
   
    If this note title is not defined or not recognized by the 
    installation process, you will see an error message for each FILE
    601.71 entry.
   
    Example of error message:
    ** ERROR IN POINTER RESOLUTION OF DATA **
    Unable to find exact match and resolve pointer  (^TIU(8925.1,  
    Entry:MENTAL HEALTH CONSULT NOTE).
   
    You can correct/change the entries after installation by using the
    following menu path and option:
   
    MHS MANAGER [YSMANAGER]
      MHA3 Utilities [YTQ MHA3 MENU]
        Stop/Re-Start Progress Notes for an Instrument [YTQ PNOTE FLAG]
   
    Example of linking note title to a FILE 601.71 entry:       
    Select MH TESTS AND SURVEYS NAME: MORSE FALL SCALE  <-select test 
    GENERATE PNOTE: Yes//                               <-answer Yes
    TIU TITLE: MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC STUDY NOTE//    <-take default
    CONSULT NOTE TITLE:                                 <-select note title
    
    Some tests require the user to have the YSP security key.
