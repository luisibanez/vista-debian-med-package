 In the "Associated patches" section above, three patches are listed as
 "install with patch". It should read "<<= must be installed BEFORE". The
 text in this section is generated by the Patch Module and cannot be

 Summary of problems in Patch YS*5.01*85 corrected in this patch:
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 This patch fixes errors and defects in the Mental Health Assistant
 version 3 (MHA3).
   
 1) Changes are made in displaying, scoring, reporting or printing of the 
 following instruments:
  Morse Fall Scale - Morse Fall Scale
  SCL90R - Symptom Checklist 90 Revised
  BDI2 - Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition
  MMPI2 - Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2
  AUD-C - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption
  AUDIT - Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
  
 2) The results from the BOMC (Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration)
 test will be sent to the national database.
  
 3) The two instruments, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) Second Level
 Evaluation and TBI Follow-up are removed from MHA3.
  
 4) The ASI-MV (Addiction Severity Index, Multi-Media Version) cannot be
 edited in MHA3 which corrects the problem of the ASI-MV results being
 converted to ASI Follow-up data. 
  
 5) A new GUI (Graphical User Interface) has slightly revised data-entry
 screens and dialogs to correct usability defects and 508 compliance. The
 number of tests entered in error is reduced by a true "Cancel" option in
 data entry.
  
 6) Progress notes generated by MHA3 and the reports displayed in MHA3
 concerning instrument results are now identical in terms of question and 
 scoring summaries.
  
 7) Progress notes can be signed by a co-signer when the person who orders 
 an instrument is a student (or a person who requires a co-signer). The 
 GUI now asks those who need co-signatures to select a co-signer.
  
 8) The National Psychology Advisory Committee expressed concern regarding 
 aspects of the progress note generated from MHA3 in some instances. The 
 nature of the concern was that the content of the note may be viewed as 
 being definitive and used diagnostically by itself, rather than in
 conjunction with other clinical information. They requested that a
 disclaimer be added to the note to indicate that the information 
 contained in the note alone is not sufficient for diagnostic purposes.
  
 9) This patch also changes Mental Health routines and templates to use 
 new APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to avoid using unsupported
 fields in files 81, 81.3, 80, and 80.1. The supported calls in the ICDCODE
 API (ICR #3990) are now used.
   
 Changes to the ICD9 file (#80) necessitated calls to the new API's as
 opposed to the older direct calls to the ICD9 global.
   
 This patch contains 2 modified Mental Health fields, 2 new Mental Health 
 fields, 19 Mental Health routines, 1 new Print Template, 1 new Sort
 Template, 2 new Remote Procedure Calls and 1 modified Option.
  
   
 MH TESTS AND SURVEYS file (#601.71):
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 This file defines the interviews, surveys and tests available in MHA3.
 Attributes of the instruments include authoring credits, target
 populations, normative samples and copyright information. Actions
 available including privileging, reporting of full item content and
 transmission to the Mental Health National Database are also specified.
  
 This file is updated with the appropriate information for each of these
 instruments: Morse Fall Scale, SCL9R, BDI2, MMPI2, AUD-C, AUDIT and BOMC.
   
 The following fields were changed to support administration and reporting 
 privileging. 
  
 601.71,8      A PRIVILEGE       1;6 POINTER TO SECURITY KEY FILE (#19.1)

                                 previously started instrument.  Set to 
                                 zero if re-start is not allowed. Set to
                                 minus 1 if instrument can be completed at
                                 any time.
  
  
 The following fields were added.

               HELP-PROMPT:      Should the TIU note be created? 
               DESCRIPTION:      Select No (or leave null) to stop MHA3 
                                 from generating a TIU note.  Clinical
                                 Reminders do not read this flag. TIU notes
                                 are never generated for a test that has an
                                 R_Privilege set.
  
  
 601.71,29     TIU TITLE         8;9 POINTER TO TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION

 375511, 406335, 432017, 449220, 455597, 459943).
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 When MHA3 tries to score the instrument SCL-9R, according to Don Donati, 
 "The problem occurs when the program attempts to execute the EXECUTABLE
 SCORING CODE: D MULT^YTSCL9R, but line label "MULT" does not exist in 
 this routine. This produces errors In the trap, e.g.,
 "<NOLINE>SCOR1+8^YTQAPI14.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 M code changes were made to avoid this error.
  
  
 2) 241181 and 242543 (duplicates: 247303, 272392, 410792, 441767).
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 When printing MMPI2 reports, the graph is not displayed on one page and 
 the T-score will wrap.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The report template has end-of-page markers (**eop**) to signal the start 
 of a new page for the printer. The width of the printer page is set to
 avoid unnecessary wrapping.

 5) 231173 (duplicate 288154)
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 TBI 2nd level Evaluation errors.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The TBI 2nd Level Evaluation has been removed from the list of active 
 instruments.
  
  
 6) 234141 (duplicates: 262796, 272784, 336196, 336426).
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC STUDY NOTE does not allow the user to have a 
 co-signer for the note.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Co-signer is included with appropriate business rules. 
  
  
 7) 283809 (duplicate 378085)
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Morse Fall Scale has incorrect scoring on the question concerning 
 Ambulatory aid: the third alternative (answer) should have a score-value
 of 15 but is scored as a 10 instead.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The correct value of 15 is now in place.
  
  
 8) 304299
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Mental Health Assistant times out while user is active in ASI. This is 
 based on the inactivity of CPRS. If CPRS times out, MHA3 will also
 time-out, even if the user is actively entering data in the ASI. (This was
 only a concern with the ASI, other instruments were not closed when CPRS
 timed out.)
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The ASI data-entry screen will remain active, even if CPRS times-out. Once the 
 ASI is completed, MHA3 will close.
  
  
 9) 235709
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The Addiction Severity Index, Multi-Media Version (ASI-MV) is a COTS 
 product in use at a few sites. The ASI Manager Menu in MHA3 displays the
 status and results of ASI-MV (as it does the other three types of ASIs
 Full, Lite and Follow-up). If an ASI is not signed, it can still be 
 edited by the user. The problem was that the ASI-MV should not be edited.
 It is completed only by the patient. When the user attempted to sign the
 ASI-MV, MHA3 incorrectly treated it as a Follow-up and required the user
 to answer more questions.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 The ASI-MV cannot be edited, only signed (if it is complete).
  
  
 10) 248645
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Instrument entered in error. Even the most conscientious clinicians can 
 start an instrument on a patient and then realize while entering the data,
 or some time later, that the data was entered on the wrong patient. MHA3
 did not have a way to ignore a faulty administration that was in process.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 To provide a way for clinicians to back out of data-entry, this patch for 
 MHA3 has a "Cancel" button on the data-entry screen. When pressed, no
 information about that administration is saved to VistA. If the error was
 not caught before the data were saved, there are now two ways to remove
 data entered-in-error. A) The person who has the MHS Manager [YSMANAGER]
 menu can use the re-designed MHS Manager menu in VistA to remove the
 incorrect administration. B) The MH Manager can use MHA3; from the
 Instruments Results Review screen, the incorrect administration can be
 deleted by pressing the "DEL" key. The advantage to the GUI method is
 that the entire report is visible so the MH Manager has more information
 as to which instrument is to be removed.
  
 11) 228898
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 After completing a test in the Mental Health Assistant the MENTAL HEALTH
 DIAGNOSTIC STUDY NOTE is created in CPRS. When the clinician goes to
 select a new patient they are not prompted to sign the note and a view
 alert is generated.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 CPRS will show unsigned notes on the patient selection screen. However 
 CPRS is unable to prompt for signatures elsewhere for TIUs created
 outside CPRS. This request has been sent to the CPRS team.
  
  
 12) 232470 (duplicate: 271310).
  
 Problem:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Patients with a period in their DFN produce error UNDEFINED>GETDATA+9^PXRMMH.
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 Patients with a period in their DFN will no longer produce an error code. 
 Presumably patient DFNs should not have periods.

 PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==============================
 1. If it does not already exist, create the progress note title "MENTAL
 HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC STUDY NOTE" (without quotes) in the progress note
 hierarchy. Sites should have this note title, though. It's creation was 
 part of the YS*5.01*85 instructions (January 2008).
  
 This new patch, YS*5.01*96, adds a new field, TIU TITLE (#29), to the MH 
 TESTS AND SURVEYS (#601.71) file. This field is a pointer to the TIU 
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION (#8925.1) file. This patch exports the entries in FILE
 601.71 with the TIU TITLE field filled in with this note title.
  
 If this note title is not defined or not recognized by the installation 
 process, you will see an error message for each FILE 601.71 entry.
  
 Example of error message:
   ** ERROR IN POINTER RESOLUTION OF DATA **
  Unable to find exact match and resolve pointer  (^TIU(8925.1,  
  Entry:MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSTIC STUDY NOTE).
  
 You can correct the entries after installation by using the following 
 menu path and option:
  
  MHS MANAGER [YSMANAGER]
    MHA3 Utilities [YTQ MHA3 MENU]
      Stop/Re-Start Progress Notes for an Instrument [YTQ PNOTE FLAG]
