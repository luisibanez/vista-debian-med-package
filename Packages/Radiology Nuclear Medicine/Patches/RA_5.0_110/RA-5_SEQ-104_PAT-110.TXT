Subject: CORRECT SUBSCRIPT ERROR IN RAPROD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issue:
      
 When attempting to display Radiology exams in CPRS (Imaging - local 
 only), CPRS will be interrupted with a subscript error when the procedure
 code is missing.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 HD0000000341299 - CDIS+8^RAPROD
            
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering a parent procedure during Radiology Exam Entry/Patient 
 Registration it is possible to have an abnormal termination of a session
 either by closing your terminal session or by shutting down your device.  
 If this happens at the precise moment that you have elected to enter a
 descendent exam but have not yet entered a procedure code for this exam,
 an error is not relayed until attempting to display the associated report
 in CPRS (Imaging - local only). At that point a subscript error is
 generated. 
          
 Resolution :
 ------------ 
 A modification will be made to routine RAPROD to not produce the subscript
 error by having the routine sense the absence of the procedure code and
 return to the executing for loop.     
      
    ==================== Installation Instructions ====================
