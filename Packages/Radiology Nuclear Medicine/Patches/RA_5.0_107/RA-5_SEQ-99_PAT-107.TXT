Subject: NTP II: HL7 upgrade; VISN configuration enhancements

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 RA*5.0*107 has two purposes: the first is to correct a design issue with 
 RA*5.0*78 (v2.3 query/response) and the second is to build the 
 query/response messaging interface to work with v2.4 of HL7.
  
 The first issue is that the original NTP Query/Response software
 (RA*5.0*78) was not designed to accommodate multiple legacy facilities,
 each with their own NTP gateway, referencing a single VistA production
 system or VistA instance.
  
 A single VistA instance knows of only one NTP Gateway: the gateway tied 
 to the RA-SCIMAGE logical link. What happens is that query responses
 are being broadcast to the incorrect NTP gateway.
  
 RA*5.0*107 will address the issue by:
 * receiving the NTP gateway query
 * identify the NTP gateway which receives the query responses
 * build the responses to that query
 * broadcast the responses to the correct NTP gateway
  
 In order to implement this business rule, all relevant NTP gateways must
 be identified and logical link records created specifically for those NTP
 gateways.
  
 Note: The number of NTP gateways can differ from VISN to VISN. It 
 is up the NTP technical team and the IRM staff responsible for
 supporting the NTP interface to create the correct logical link
 records.
  
 The historical information included in the responses to a query serves
 as a reference for the teleradiologists working for the National
 Teleradiology Project (NTP).
  
 *** ATTENTION - for present NTP sites (only), when installing RA*5.0*107
 it is critical this vendor be contacted to turn off the NTP Query
 component of the interface. Contact the Outlook mail group VHA NTP
 SUPPORT to coordinate VA facility and vendor implementation and
 configuration. ***
  
 The client (ScImage) requests results based on the following query 
 parameters:
  
 * A patient, within a patient care event date/time window, & 
   maximum number of results to be returned.
  
 Note: ScImage is a specific vendor. The query was developed to be vendor 
 independent, however ScImage is the vendor currently contracted by the 
 NTP. 
  
 In order to operate properly, the following conditions must be met:
 1) Determine the IP address of the HLO multi-threaded listener. The 
    listener is setup as a TCP/IP service and is defined to 'listen' on
    port 5001. This information is necessary for ScImage to properly
    communicate with the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine application.
  
 2) If your VistA instance is to broadcast HL7 responses to more than one
    dedicated NTP Gateway, new logical links must created. The following
    steps must be taken:
       a) The TCP/IP ADDRESS field of these newly created logical links
          must be entered as the TCP/IP address of the specific NTP
          Gateway.
       b) The DNS DOMAIN field of these newly created logical links must be
          entered, in lowercase, as the DNS DOMAIN of the specific NTP
          Gateway.
  
 3) Newly created NTP Gateway logical links must have the TCP/IP PORT
    (OPTIMIZED) field set to a port value of: 21998.
      
    Note: VA facility support staff are responsibility for creating or
    editing NTP Gateway logical links.
  
       * Contact the NTP troubleshooting staff via Outlook at mail group: 
         VHA NTP SUPPORT or call: 877-780-5559 (please select option #1).

 This patch must be installed with VistA Radiology users off-line. The 
 estimated installation time for this patch is three minutes.
  
     1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  
        This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
  
     2. The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.  
   
     3. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
        following options: 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global 
  
     4. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
        following option: 
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s) 
            Select INSTALL NAME: RA*5.0*107
                                 ==========
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols?
