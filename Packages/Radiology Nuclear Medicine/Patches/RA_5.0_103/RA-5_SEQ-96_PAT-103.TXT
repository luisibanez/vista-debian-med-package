Subject: CORRECT THE CPT DISPLAY AND FIX THE OUTSIDE REPORT ALERT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following 3 issues:
      
 1.  When Outside Reports are entered into Vista, the reports are not
     being delivered to the Picture Archiving and Communication Systems
     (PACS) systems via HL7 messages because reports are not being
     translated as "F" Final.  Outside reports have a REPORT STATUS of "EF"
     (Electronically Filed) instead of "V" (Verified) and do not get
     translated  by the system as Final reports.
 2.  When running the Procedure/CPT Statistics Report [RA CPTSTATS], if the
     prompt, "Do you want to count CPT Modifiers separately?"is answered
     "YES",  CPT Codes w/modifiers will not print on the report.
 3.  When an Outside Report is entered and completed, it does not generate
     a CPRS Notification (alert), "Imaging Results" if no Radiology
     diagnosis code is specified.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1.  HD0000000363538  Outside Reports status codes
  
 PROBLEM:
 --------
 Outside Reports are created with a report status (74:5) of "EF" 
 (Electronically Filed). VistA translates only reports with a report status
 of "V" (Verified) as "Final" (F) in HL7 Result Status in OBR-25 and
 OBX-11) when creating HL7 records/messages.  Most PACS systems are
 configured to only receive "Final" Reports.  Currently, Outside Reports
 cannot be stored on most PACS systems.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------   
 A modification will be made in routines RAHLRPT and RAHLRU to 
 translate the REPORT STATUS (74;5) of "EF"  provided by Outside 
 Reporting into an "F" HL7 Result Status (OBR-25 and OBX-11, V2.3) 
 for Final to be broadcast out to VistA Observation Results Unsolicited 
 subscribers which will allow reports to be delivered to the PACS systems.
      
 2.  HD0000000349101  Radiology procedures with no CPT codes
  
 Problem:
 -------- 
 When users use the option Procedure/CPT Statistics Report [RA CPTSTATS] 
 and answer the prompt "Do you want to count CPT Modifiers separately?"
 "YES", CPT codes with modifiers will not print/display on the report
 because a function call in RACPT1 does not correctly interpret the
 CPT w/modifier.
      
 Resolution:
 ------------
 A modification will be made in RACPT1 to interpret the CPT code 
 correctly and display/print the CPT codes w/modifiers.
      
 3.  HD0000000324541  Outside Reports does not generate Imaging Results 
                      CPRS Alert
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 If a user enters an Outside Report [RA OUTSIDE RPTENTRY] 
 without a Radiology diagnosis code, there is no VistA non-critical 
 Alert/CPRS Notification generated as is generated in Report Entry/Edit
 [RA RPTENTRY].
 Currently routine RARTE7 will quit the alert processing if no diagnosis 
 code is present.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A modification will be made to continue the alert processing and send a
 non-critical alert.    
       
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 *NOTE
 XINDEX will produce the following error.  This is not a problem 
 as the reference to a routine not in the UCI is coded with conditions
 that will only attempt to utilize the identified routine if it exists 
 in the UCI. This is a pre-existing item that was introduced in RA*5*84.
