Subject: CORRECT ISSUE WITH MISSING IMAGES DISPLAYING IN VISTA RAD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the issue with Images that are not getting 
 attached to an Exam.  
  
 When a user attempts to create a radiology report and another process is 
 engaged in a case edit operation on the same case, the case edit 
 operation will inadvertently overwrite the REPORT TEXT field with a null.
  
 NOTE:  After installation of this patch, users case editing or status 
 tracking exams during image storage can result in an incorrect image 
 count in VistA Imaging Display and VistARad.  This will be resolved in a 
 future VistA Imaging DICOM gateway patch.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000330689 - Not all images in a study display in VistaRad, 
  Images are in Imaging display
  
 PROBLEM
 -------
 When adding images to an exam in the Imaging package, a Radiology stub 
 report is created for the purpose of attaching the images. This process 
 calls a Radiology routine (RARIC), which also updates the associated
 Radiology Exam data in the RAD/NUC MED PATIENT (#70) file, REPORT 
 TEXT (#17) field.  
 If a different user is editing the associated exam at the same moment the
 images are being attached to the stub report, field #17 is overwritten
 with a null by the Radiology Exam edit.
 This causes an exam to not be associated with the Radiology stub report.
  
 RESOLUTION
 ----------
 The events leading to the overwrite of the REPORT TEXT field must be
 prevented.
  
 To correct this issue Process B must LOCK the exam node being updated. 
 When Process B attempts to LOCK the exam node that LOCK attempt 
 will fail because Process A has requested and been granted a LOCK 
 for the same exam node.
