 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 1. INC0000000780331 - This is an issue with the v2.4 HL7 upgrade
      
    Problem:
    -------- 
    The Radiology v2.4 Health Level 7 (HL7) upgrade did not include HL7
    subscriber setup instructions for a commercial middleware component
    that did not exist when the software was developed but is now in
    production use at sites. Sites are using the new component due to how
    the vendor's product  has evolved and per their service agreements
    with the vendor.
     
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A document has been provided by the Radiology development group that 
    can be retrieved at the location below and will include instructions
    for HL7 subscriber setup for the commercial middleware component.
     
       
 2. INC0000000827987 Radiology - Voice Recognition Setup:
       
    Problem:
    --------     
    In the VistA Radiology HL7 Observation Result (ORU) report message,
    per IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise) Radiology Transaction
    business rules, we do not include an Common Order (ORC) segment. The
    Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) Voice Recognition (VR) vendor relies
    on the ORC segment to properly deconstruct the message.  Without that,
    the COTS VR product is not properly deconstructing the message fields
    and a corrupted report gets stored on the COTS VR side.  What we need
    to do at this point is supply the instructions for disabling the Voice
    Recognition side from receiving inbound reports from VistA. (Receiving
    Radiology reports into Voice Recognition is not needed at this time.)
     
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A document has been provided by the Radiology development group that 
    can be retrieved at the location below and will include instructions
    for on how to disable the Voice Recognition side from receiving
    inbound Radiology Reports.
  
 3. INC0000000816372 - HL7 issue preventing radiology from processing
                       inbound reports.
  
    Problem:
    -------- 
    While receiving inbound Radiology reports from third party vendor 
    packages through HL7 version 2.4 it was discovered that the
    programming code in routine RAHLRU1 was not properly handling large
    amounts of data in the Observation Request (OBR) segment of the HL7
    data causing VistA to reject valid Radiology reports.
     
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in routine RAHLRU1 to correctly 
    reconstruct the OBR segment data into the proper format for further 
    processing within the Radiology system.
     
 4. INC0000000829049 -  Radiology - HL7 Issue:
  
    Problem:
    -------- 
    This is an issue that impacts the v2.4 HL7 interface for VistA
    Radiology/Nuclear Medicine. The National Teleradiology Product has
    workflow that allows a national teleradiologist to release a study
    back to the VA facility for interpretation. This event is passed with
    'VAQ' being passed as the Result Status in OBR-25 of the inbound ORU
    (Observation Results Unsolicited) HL7 message.
      
    VistA is not prepared to accept the 'VAQ' status and as a result, the
    report is rejected.
     
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in routine RAHLTCPX to allow VistA to
    accept 'VAQ' as a valid result status.
     
 5. INC0000000829071 - Radiology - HL7 Issue:
  
    Problem:
    -------- 
    The issue is that a successful National Teleradiology Project release 
    of the study back to the facility generates an erroneous application 
    error acknowledgement when an application accept acknowledgement is
    the correct acknowledgement to send.
          
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in routine RARPTUT to send the correct 
    application accept acknowledgement.
