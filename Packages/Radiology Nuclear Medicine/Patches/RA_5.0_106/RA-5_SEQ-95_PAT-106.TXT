Description:
============

 The objective of this project is to provide support for the national 
 implementation of the National Teleradiology Program (NTP) as Veterans 
 Affairs Central Office (VACO) has requested.
  
 This release will include:
 1.  Accepting a new Request Status (HL7 Table 0123) indicating that the
     teleradiology center is releasing the study back to the local Veterans
     Administration Medical Center (VAMC) for interpretation.
  
 2.  Enhancing the VistA Radiology/Nuclear Medicine (VistA RIS) application
     to process the new request status. For studies without images the
     existing preliminary report is to be deleted. For studies with images
     the report is to inherit the traits of an Imaging Stub report.
  
 3.  Notifying the users in the RAD HL7 MESSAGES mail group that a study has
     been released back to the local VAMC.
       a. Postmaster will appear as sender of the message. RAD HL7 
          MESSAGES was intended to be a private mail group. To ensure mail
          delivery please make sure that POSTMASTER is added as a MEMBER of
          the RAD HL7 MESSAGES mail group.
  
 4.  Calculates the correct examination status of the study and updates   
     the study to that correct exam status. Properly defined examination
     status parameters improve workflow. The emphasis on examination
     status parameter setup for patch RA*5.0*106 is because it is the
     study's examination status which defines VistaRad's unread worklist.
       a. Commercial PACS systems will require their unread worklist to be
          updated manually based on verbal communication between personnel
          at the teleradiology center and the local VAMC's radiology
          department.
       b. Please check the EXAMINATION STATUS parameter definitions, within
          imaging type, to see that they're setup properly. 
  
 5.  There is a modification to the ACTIVITY LOG (#74.01) sub-file of 
     RAD/NUC MED REPORTS file (#74). The TYPE OF ACTION (#2) field has
     been modified to accept a new set of codes value of 'Q' for Quit. 'Q'
     indicates that the National Tele-radiology center has released the
     study back to the local facility for interpretation.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ==============================
 Please note XINDEX will generate errors and warnings when run for this 
 build. The errors reflect the reference to the RAHLTCPX routine that is a
 component of unreleased patch (RA*5.0*47). RA*5.0*47 will not be released
 in the near term (within three months). The references to this routine
 checks if RAHLTCPX resides in a Cache instance. If RAHLTCPX does not
 reside in the Cache instance, RAHLTCPX will not execute.
