Subject: INFORMATIONAL - VistA Standardization:  INCOMPLETE RECORDS TRACKING

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch is issued as directed in Memorandum: Open Source
 VistA Deployment (VAIQ #7256522), dated Aug 31, 2012. Refer to this 
 document for specific details.
   
 A review of the VistA Standardization routines was completed for:
 INCOMPLETE RECORDS TRACKING version 1.0. A baseline list of the
 nationally released M routines and their official checksums is 
 included below. VistA Standardization Certification represents
 the matching of the routine checksums, compared in the site's 
 Production account only.
   
 The VistA Standardization Team performed an analysis of each site's
 Production environment. For any site with routine checksum variance,
 this team worked with the site to remediate any variance from the 
 baseline.  After the completion of this process, sites with no variance
 were identified as VistA Standardization Certified for the package. 
 There is NO additional action required on the part of these sites. 
   
 For sites which had variance (local modification) and determined it was
 important to maintain for their Production environment, a waiver was 
 requested. If approved, the waiver allows retention of the local 
 modification to a VistA Standardization routine, as detailed in 
 VA Directive 6402.
   
 Each site will be placed on one of the lists below:  
       VistA Standardization Certified Sites
       Sites with Approved/Pending Waiver
       Non-Compliant Sites with Pending Remediation
  
 The expectation for sites on the Non-Compliant Sites with Pending 
 Remediation list is for their remediation to be completed, by either
 removing the modification or requesting a waiver. There will NOT 
 be an additional Informational Only patch to move the site to the
 VistA Standardization Certified Sites list.
   
 Please Note:
     Environment check routines, pre or post installation routines 
     remaining from previously installed patches, compiled routines
     (e.g. cross-reference), or prior package version routines, will NOT
     affect your site's standardization compliance. Their existence, or 
     non-existence, at your site, or on the VistA Standardization routines
     list below, does not impact the VistA Standardization Certification. 
  
     VistA Standardization Certification for this package applies to the
     Date specified in the Official Checksum heading below. If additional
     patches, or a newer version for the package, has been released since
     this date, the checksums for affected routines will be different. 
     For these routines, refer to the patch/version documentation for the
     most up-to-date checksums.
    
 Note: Site 556  NORTH CHICAGO, IL is exempt from this project objective.
