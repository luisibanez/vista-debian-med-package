Subject: TERMINOLOGY UPDATES TO TERM (#704.101) FILE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following two groups of issues:
      
 1) The TERM file (#704.101) in Clinical Procedures (CP) contains
    terminology used during data entry/display in CP Flowsheet.  Several
    terms allow only one selection from a list when multiple selections
    need to be available for selection. The affected terms are:
      
    SIDE RAILS
    PCA - LINE CARE
    IV SITE CONDITION
    ADL - EMOTIONAL SUPPORT
    ADL - AMBULATION ASSISTANCE
    ISOLATION PRECAUTIONS
       
 2) The term PAINAD FACIAL EXPRESSION contains a list of selectable
    responses.  Text in one of the responses needs to be modified to better
    describe the response.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
        
 1) HD0000000711579 Term: PCA Line Care - Change Observations 
                          to "Select Many"
    Problem 1:
    ----------
    The term PCA - LINE CARE allows only one selection from a list when 
    multiple selections need to be available for selection.
  
 2) HD0000000711671 Term: Side Rails - Observations need to be set 
                          to "Select Many"
    Problem 2:

 4) HD0000000713729 TERM: Emotional Support - Change to "Select Many"
    Problem 4:
    ----------
    The term ADL - EMOTIONAL SUPPORT allows only one selection from 
    a list when multiple selections need to be available for selection.
  
 5) HD0000000717379 Approved CP Terminology.
    Problem 5:
    ----------

    Problem 6:
    ----------
    The term ISOLATION PRECAUTIONS allows only one selection from a list 
    when multiple selections need to be available for selection.
  
    Resolution 1 - 6:
   ------------------     
    Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make a modification to the TERM file
    (#704.101) to change the presentation of responses for each term from
    one selection to many selections for each term.
      
 7) HD0000000713734 TERM: PAINAD Facial Expression - Observation Change
    Problem 7:
    ----------     
    The term PAINAD FACIAL EXPRESSION in Clinical Procedures Flowsheet
    currently displays the following for selection (one only)
      
    0 = Smiling or Inexpressive
    1 = Sad, Frightened, Frown
    Facial Grimacing
      
    This needs to display as
      
    0 = Smiling or Inexpressive
    1 = Sad, Frightened, Frown
    2 = Facial Grimacing
      
    Resolution 7:
    ------------     
    Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make a modification to the TERM file
    (#704.101) to display the selection correctly.
  
  
 Additional Information:
 =======================
 This patch also includes changes to the 4 high and low boundaries in the
 TERM file (#704.101) listed in the table below.
  
 Terminology high and low boundary changes
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Name          | Type  | Mask |  Normal Range  | Abbrev |
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Pulse           Num.    ###       60 - 100        HR
 Temperature C   Num.    ###.#     35.0 - 39.0    Temp
 SpO2%           Num.    ###       92 - 100       SpO2%
 SvO2%           Num.    ###       60 - 75        SvO2%
  
 These new ranges were approved by Elizabeth Mims from Applied Informatics 
 Services (AIS).
  
 NOTE: After the recommendation above for Temperature C was developed, a
 new recommendation went out on Remedy Ticket HD0000000769788 to ask the
 temp high cut off to be 100.9 F (38.3 C) in order to work around the 
 problem with Vitals Manager not allowing a decimal to be included in high 
 low ranges (which would allow sites to set Vitals Manager high to 101). 
 This will be addressed in patch MD*1.0*33.
