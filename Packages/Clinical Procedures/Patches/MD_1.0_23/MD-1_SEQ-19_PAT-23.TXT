 Remedy Tickets
 ==========================================================================
 HD0000000496628 - The unit conversion for some observations do not 
 convert equally due to a non-existent measurement that is needed for the 
 conversion.  This causes an error in the flowsheet reporting mechanism.  
 This patch shall remove the unit from the observation.
  
 HD0000000554645 - There are four default qualifiers that the end user can 
 optionally populate when adding a supplemental or optional view to a 
 patient flowsheet under MD*1.0*16: method, position, location, and 
 product.
  
 A design flaw was reported where the qualifiers selected for an optional 
 or supplemental view were not displayed in the header of the view, only 
 in the report generated by that view.  This prevents the user from seeing 
 the context of the observations.  This patch adds the selected qualifiers 
 to the header of supplemental views, and removes the ability to select 
 qualifiers from optional views, as optional views do not maintain that 
 context.
  
 HD0000000525716 (CQ 715) - The totalling subsystem in the flowsheet GUI 
 filters all observations in supplemental views to prevent them from being 
 added to other totals.  This filtering was not occurring when reports 
 were generated.  This lead to inaccurate totals being pushed into TIU.
  
  
  
 ClearQuest Deficiencies
 ==========================================================================
  
 The CP Flowsheet Enhancements patch MD*1.0*23 shall resolve 
 thirteen known anomalies with the Flowsheet patch MD*1.0*16.  Patch MD*1*16
 was released with the following known anomalies:
  
 1.     CQ579
  
 The hospital location does not get passed to Text Integration Utility (TIU)
 and does not get displayed in Computerized Patient Record (CPRS).  The
 user will not be able to change the hospital location of the patient in
 Flowsheet so the inpatient location will always be used to create the note.
  
 2.     CQ580    
 The general comment given when entering Flowsheet data (shown on same line
 as location) does not appear on any reports.  The field will be removed.
  
 3.     CQ638
 Add the ability to show comments for observations as a hint.
  
  
 4.     CQ680
 Use the ACL (Access Control List) functionality already built into CP Console
 for use at the Flowsheet/View level to control access to CP Console
 functionality at the folder level.  The HL7 tab will be visible on an ongoing
 basis.  However, the buttons to match a message to either a device or a patient
 will be disabled unless the user has the CP HL7 MANAGER key.
  
  
 5.     CQ681
 Auto Refresh is not working.
  
 6.     CQ695
 Simple update to Flowsheet report to add a space between title and date.
  
  
 7.     CQ705
 Not all of the column headings match up with the selections in the Add Data
 screen of Flowsheets view.
  
 8.     CQ708
 Ability to see Supplemental page once it is change to Optional.
        
 9.     CQ711
 The ability for CP Console to save the note title in the Procedure and
 Flowsheet screens.
  
 10.    CQ712
 Spell out Juice and Water qualifiers on TIU note.
  
 11.    CQ714
 In CP Console, allow copying of Procedures and Instruments.
  
 12.    CQ715
 Remedy 525716. Supplemental views, duplicate values. The report tab in CP
 Flowsheets is not correctly filtering observations that were entered via a
 supplemental view.
  
 13.    CQ720
 Marking Inactive Terms in the drop-down list of the View Term Editor when
 adding terms to a view.
  
 NEW FUNCITONALITY
 ==========================================================================
  
 Nihon-Koden medical device terminology mapping enhancement will be released
 with this patch.
  
 The ability to accept data from multiple approved medical devices concurrently
 will be included in this patch.
  
 A miscellaneous change is to make a supplemental view that was started the
 default view upon final steps of opening process.
                                                              
 Ability for clinicians to re-transmit ADT feed to the medical devices in an
 outpatient setting without having to manually enter patient info on the device.
