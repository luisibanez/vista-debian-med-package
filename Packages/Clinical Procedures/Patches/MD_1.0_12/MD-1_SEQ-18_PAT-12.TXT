Description:
============

  
 This Clinical Procedures (CP) Flowsheets patch (i.e., MD*1*12) will 
 support outbound Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging without the use of 
 the VistA Data Extraction Framework (VDEF).  This patch with HL7 
 messaging, and the CP Gateway service will enhance notification to 
 medical devices of a patient's admission, discharge, and transfer (ADT).  
 This patch will improve current CP Flowsheets Outbound ADT Feed 
 functionality.
  
 Note:  Patch MD*1*16 is the Clinical Flowsheets application.  Patch 
 MD*1*16 is a pre-requisite to this patch (MD*1*12).  Prior to installing 
 MD*1*12, MD*1*16 must be installed and the Clinical Flowsheets Outbound
 ADT Feed must be configured. Instructions for the configuration of the 
 Outbound ADT Feed are in section 6.4 of the Clinical Flowsheets
 Implementation Guide (MD_1_P12_IMPG.DOC)
  
  
  
  
 1.  FEATURE:  Support HL7 messaging without the use of VDEF.
  
 2.  ENHANCEMENT:  Provide support of HL7 Discharge (A03)/Cancel Discharge 
 (A13) messages containing no ward/bed data.
  
 3.  ENHANCEMENT:  Provide support of the Outbound ADT Feed.
  
  
  
 ASSOCIATED NOIS/REMEDY TICKET
 =============================
 HD0000000484147:        The ADT feed provided by CP in patch MD*1*16 is not 
 sending discharge messages.
  
 Solution:               The CP ADT feed was not designed to support any ADT 
 message not having ward/bed data.  The VistA/Registration (DG) ADT Discharge
 Message has no ward/bed data.  CP patch MD*1*12 adds support of ADT Discharge
 Messages containing no ward/bed data.

 SERVER SOFTWARE (VistA Patch MD*1*12) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ================================================================
  
 NOTE:  Clinical Procedures patch MD*1*16 is a pre-requisite to the
 installation of MD*1*12 software.
  
 To obtain all updated MD*1*12 files, use File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
 to retrieve MD1_0P12.KID from one of the following OI Field Offices'
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:
  
       OI Field Office    FTP Address                Directory
       ---------------    -----------                ---------
       Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov   anonymous.software
       Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov    anonymous.software
       Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov      anonymous.software
  
  
 NOTE:  MD*1*12 (Clinical Flowsheets) includes "pre-install" routine 
 MDPRE12.  For Clinical Flowsheets to function Properly, this routine 
 must finish completely.  A message will display on the screen, among other
 installation messages, documenting when the routine is "complete"/"done". 
 The MDPRE12 routine will inactivate CP FLOWSHEETS' HL7/VDEF event-type
 protocols. MDPRE12 is not deleted during MD*1*12 installation, but
 deletion of that routine will cause no issue with functionality and
 performance.
  
  
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system. Installation time is 
 less than three minutes.
  
 ATTENTION: Installation of this patch should NOT BE QUEUED.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
 Please note: the time required to complete the post-install and to 
 receive the MailMan message will vary depending on your system load.
