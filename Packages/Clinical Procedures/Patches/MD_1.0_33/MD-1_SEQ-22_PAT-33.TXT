Subject: CHANGE CC TO CUBIC CENTIMETER AND HIGH LIMIT FOR TEMPERATURE IN TERM FILE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following 2 issues:
      
 1) A qualifier record in the Clinical Procedures (CP) Terminology TERM
    file (#704.101) is set to utilize "cc" in the ABBREVIATION (#.03) field
    and the DISPLAY_NAME (#.04) field. The CP Terminology review board has
    requested the qualifier be changed from "cc" to "Cubic Cent" in the
    ABBREVIATION (#.03) field and "Cubic Centimeter" in the DISPLAY_NAME
    (#.04) field.
      
 2) The term TEMPERATURE needs to be modified to accept 100.9 as the high 
    limit for Fahrenheit and 38.3 as the high limit for Celsius.

 2) HD0000000769788 Terminology Correction (Approved)

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
  
 1) HD0000000744027 Remove Volume Qualifier "cc". Approved CP Terminology
  
    Problem:
    --------     
    The CP Terminology Review Board has requested that "cc" be replaced
    with "Cubic Cent" in the ABBREVIATION (#.03) field and "Cubic
    Centimeter" in the DISPLAY_NAME (#.04) field for the Cubic Centimeter
    qualifier record in TERM file (#704.101).
       
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make a modification to the TERM file
    (#704.101) as described in the Problem Section above.
      
 2) HD0000000769788 Terminology Correction (Approved)
      
    Problem:
    --------  
    The high limit for the term TEMPERATURE in Fahrenheit is 101.5 F and 
    needs to be set to 100.9 F to more closely match the high limits set in
    Vitals and Measurements.  The high limit for the term TEMPERATURE in
    Celsius is 39.0 C and needs to be set to 38.3 C to more closely match
    the high limit set in Vital and Measurements.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Post-Init routine MDTERMX will make a modification to the 
    TERM_UNIT_PAIR file (#704.105) as described in the Problem Section
    above.
