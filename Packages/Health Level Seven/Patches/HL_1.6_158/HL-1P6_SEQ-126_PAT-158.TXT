Description:
============

 Patch HL*1.6*158 makes several changes to the Health Level Seven Optimized
 (HLO) software.
  
   Changes:
   ============
   1. Patch HL*1.6*155 included routine HLOPING with a typo on the list of
      patches on the second line.  This patch corrects the second line.
      ** When installing this patch, you should ignore the warning about
      the incoming routine having different patches. **
 
   2. It has been reported that, on rare occasions, when an application
      acknowledgment is received the ACKNOWLEDGMENT BY field (#.07) and the
      COMPLETION STATUS field (#.2) of the original message's record in the
      HLO MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION file (#778) are not updated.  The issue
      is caused by contention between the server process and the infiler
      process trying to update the same record at the same time.  This patch
      resolves the problem by having the infiler process do all the updates
      to the record.
  
   3. There is a mistake in the set and kill logic for the "C" and "D"
      new-style cross-references in the MESSAGE TYPE ACTIONS sub-file
      (#779.21) of the HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY file (#779.2). When the
      message type and message event are edited, the old entry in the
      cross-references may be left defined. The set and kill logic is
      corrected in this patch. 
  
   4. The HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY file (#779.2) has been enhanced to allow
      Applications to specify how long to retain their messages before they
      are purged.  
 
      To support this new functionality, these fields have been added:
       
      a) In the HLO MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION FILE (#778) the optional
         APP-SPECIFIED RETENTION field (#.22) is new.  It will be used
         to store the retention time specified by the application.
 
      In the HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY file (#779.2) there are two new fields.
 
      b) The MINIMUM RETENTION TIME field (#.13) specifies the default
         retention time for the application. 
 
      c) In the MESSAGE TYPE ACTIONS multiple (field #1) is the MINIMUM
         RETENTION TIME field (#.08) that applies to the specific message
         type.  If present it will override the general retention time
         specified in field #.13 (see b above).
     
      d) The new EDIT MESSAGE RETENTION TIME [HLO MESSAGE RETENTION
         TIME] option has been added to the HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY MENU
         option [APPLICATION REGISTRY MENU] so that application developers
         can edit the new parameters. 
 
    5. In the file HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#779.1) the NORMAL MSG
       RETENTION (DAYS) field (#.07) has been modified to record the retention
       time for the site's HLO messages in days rather than hours.  The
       default retention time will be 3 days, rather than the 36 hours that
       was used prior to this patch.  Sites may reset the parameter to 1 or 2 
       days if disk space is a problem.
 
    6. The HLO PING option [PING REMOTE SYSTEM] has been modified to include
       the user's DUZ in the PING message. This is a troubleshooting aid
       requested by Product Support. 
  
    7. Two syntax errors, reported in Remedy tickets HD0000000624496 and
       HD0000000624517, were corrected. The syntax errors were both for 
       block structure mismatches in routines HLOPROC and HLUCM001.
 
    8. The HLO APIs for sending messages through middleware, such as the VIE,
       contains a bug. The APIs allow the application to specify two
       logical links, one for the receiving facility and one for the
       middleware.  If the application specifies that the messages are to
       be routed through middleware, the HLO client should send the message
       to the IP address and port # of the middleware.  However, HLO instead
       attempts to send the message to the IP address of the middleware but
       the port # of the receiving facility, rather than the middleware's
       port #.  This patch fixes this issue.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
        Installation time is under 3 minutes.  
        
    2.  For your production account, disable the HL7 TCPIP services
        for the HLO multi-listener running on all nodes in the cluster. 
        This step is optional for test accounts. 
  
        For example, at the VMS prompt in your
        production account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP          <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE  
  
            
   3.   Use the STOP HLO option of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to temporarily
        stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several minutes to insure 
        that all HLO processes have terminated.
  
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
        The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
        the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
           Print Transport Global 
  
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
  
           Backup a Transport Global
  
           Install Package(s) 
  
        When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the patch
        build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions, and the
        answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*158>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?  <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
  
          and Protocols?  <NO>
   
      
    6.   Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners
  
         For example, in a production account at the VMS prompt:
         ISC6A1> TCPIP             <-- at the VMS prompt
         TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE 
  
    
    7.  Use the START HLO option within the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen
        to resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
        This step is optional for test systems.
   
    8.  On production systems, verify that outgoing messages have resumed
        being transmitted.  You can do this by monitoring the system via the
        HLO System Monitor for a few minutes to insure that the count of
        messages pending transmission is not growing.
