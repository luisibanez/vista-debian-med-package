Subject: HL7 Listeners Under Linux

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch provides the ability to run the HL7 1.6 and HL7 Optimized (HLO)
 listeners under xinetd on Cache/Linux systems.  Xinetd is software for
 managing incoming connections over TCP/IP ports on Linux and Unix systems
 similarly to VMS TCPIP Services used on VMS systems.  All sites should
 install this patch regardless of their operating system, but for sites
 using Linux there are additional installation steps for configuring the
 listeners. 
  
 Sites that use Linux as their VistA platform, not just as the backend but also
 on the frontend, are required to configure their HL7 1.6 and HLO
 listeners to run under xinetd if they have not already done so.  This is
 VHA's standard for Linux systems and is recommended by both Engineering
 Services and Product Support. 
   
 Test Sites:
 ===========
 El Paso VAMC
 Oklahoma City, OK
 Tennessee Valley HCS
  
  
 Remedy:
 =======
  None
  
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. It 
       is highly recommended to install the patch during off-hours. The
       installation will complete in less than one minute.
        
   2.  Use the STOP HLO action of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to temporarily
       stop the transmission of HLO messages.
   
   3.  On VMS systems, disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO
       multi-listener running on all nodes in the cluster.
   
   4.  On VMS systems, disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HL7 1.6
       multi-listener running on all nodes in the cluster.
  
   5.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management option listed below:
  
         Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
   6.  Shutdown the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management
       option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   7.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
  
   8.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*157>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
  
  
   9.  Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
       and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
       (Note those links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
       to be restarted manually.)
    
   10. Restart the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management option
       listed below:
   
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
   
   11. Use the START HLO action of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to
       resume the transmission of HLO messages.
  
   12. On VMS systems, enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO
       multi-listeners.
    
   13. On VMS systems, enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HL7 1.6
       multi-listeners.
  
 Instructions for Configuring HL7 Listeners on Linux Sites:
 ==========================================================
 ***************************************************************** 
 *  These instructions do  ** NOT ** apply to sites that use     *
 *  Linux only for their backend database server.                *
 *****************************************************************
 
 1) A single user Linux account must be established, named 'scdtcpip'
    where 'scd' should be replaced with the three character site code
    assigned by the Regional Data Center, for the use of the TCP/IP
    listeners that will run under xinetd.  The scdtcpip user that you create
    MUST be in the 'cacheusr' group in /etc/group.  If a user account has not
    yet been established for that purpose and you need assistance then please
    enter a Remedy ticket for Product Support.
  
 2) Each listener must have a port number assigned to it for its exclusive
    use.  For VHA systems the following standard applies:
  
     HL7 1.6    Production         Port# 5000
     HL7 1.6    Test/Development   Port# 5025
     HLO        Production         Port# 5001
     HLO        Test/Development   Port# 5026
  
 3) Create a single entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870) for the
    listeners, using the LINK EDIT [HL EDIT LOGICAL LINKS] option. 
    Instructions for using the option may be found in the VISTA HEALTH LEVEL
    SEVEN (HL7) SITE MANAGER & DEVELOPER MANUAL.  One entry will suffice
    for both the HL7 1.6 and HLO listeners.  Enter the ports selected in
    step 2) when completing the TCP/IP PORT (OPTIMIZED) (#400.08) field and
    the TCP/IP PORT(#400.02) field. Also, be sure to enter the DNS DOMAIN (#.08)
    and TCP/IP ADDRESS (#400.01) fields.
  
 4) There should be exactly one entry in the HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS file
    (#779.1).  Please review that entry to insure that the field 
    HLO STANDARD LISTENER (#.1) points to the entry created in the HL LOGICAL
    LINK file (#870) created in step 3) above. 
  
   ***************************************************************************
   NOTE: For steps 5) and 6), Xinetd configuration is scripted and done during
   server creation for standard Linux VistA systems (Commodity Front End, VistA 
   Read-Only, etc.), so they should already exist. If needed, please enter a 
   Remedy ticket to request assistance from Product Support.  
   ***************************************************************************
    
  5) An xinetd configuration file is required for the HL7 1.6 listener.  The 
    file should be located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory and should be named
    scd_hlsx, where 'scd' is the local three letter site code assigned by the
    Regional Data Center, and the last letter 'x' should be changed to 'p' on
    production systems, 't' on test systems, or 'l' on legacy systems. 
 
    The file may be edited using the vi editor.  
 
    The contents of the configuration file is as follows, except that these
    parameters need to be modified:
  
     user  - Set to the name of the user established per step 1) above.
     port  - Set to the port number selected in step 2) above.
     bind  - Set to the IP address of the interface that the service should
             be bound to.
     env   - Set the value of the HLOLINK environment variable to the 
             name of the HL LOGICIAL LINK entry created in step 4) above. 
     env   - Modify the value of the TZ environment variable to match
             your site's time zone.
     server -  In the example cache is shown to be installed in the
               /usr/local/cachesys/devfey directory.  Change it to match
               your system. 
     server_args - In the example the Cache' configuration name is
                   'devfey'and the login namespace is shown as FEY. 
                   Change it to match your system.  
  
          
 Xinetd Configuration file for the HL7 1.6 Listener
 ================================================== 
 #default: on
 #description: VA HL7 Listener for FEY - port 5000
 #
 service scd_hlst
 {
     type = UNLISTED
     disable = no
     flags = REUSE
     socket_type = stream
     protocol = tcp
     port = 5000
     bind = xx.xx.xx.xx
     wait = no
     user = scdtcpip
     env = TZ=/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern
     env += port=5000
     server = /usr/local/cachesys/devfey/bin/csession
     server_args = devfey -ci -U FEY PORT^HLCSTCPA
     instances = UNLIMITED
     per_source = UNLIMITED
 }
 #end
  
  
 6) An xinetd configuration file is required for the HLO listener.  The file
    should be located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory and should be named
    scd_hlox, where 'scd' is the local three letter site code assigned by
    the Regional Data Center and the last letter 'x' should be changed to 'p'
    on production systems, 't' on test systems, or 'l' on legacy systems. 
 
    The file may be edited using the vi editor.  
  
    The contents of the configuration file is as follows, except that these
    parameters need to be modified:
  
     user  -   Set to the name of the user established per step 1) above.       
     port  -   Set it to the port number selected in step 2) above.
     Bind  -   Set to the IP address of the interface that the service should
               be bound to.
 
     env   -   Modify the value of the TZ environment variable to match
               your site's time zone.
     server -  In the example cache is shown to be installed in the
               /usr/local/cachesys/devfey directory.  Change it to match
               your system. 
     server_args - In the example the Cache' configuration name is 'devfey'
                   and the login namespace is shown as FEY. 
                   Change it to match your system.  
  
  
 Xinetd Configuration file for the HLO Listener
 ==============================================
      
 #default: on
 #description: VA HLO Listener for FEY - port 5001
 #
 service scd_hlot
 {
     type = UNLISTED
     disable = no
     flags = REUSE
     socket_type = stream
     protocol = tcp
     port = 5001
     bind = xx.xx.xx.xx
     wait = no
     user = scdtcpip
     env += TZ=/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern
     server = /usr/local/cachesys/devfey/bin/csession
     server_args = devfey -ci -U FEY LINUX1^HLOSRVR 
     instances = UNLIMITED
     per_source = UNLIMITED
 }
 #end
  
  
 7) In order to have xinetd load the new configurations files, enter the
    following command at the Linux shell prompt:
  
    /sbin/service xinetd reload
  
 8) Verify that the new configurations were completed correctly and the
    listeners are running by using the HL7 PING option.  The example below
    shows that the HLO listener is running.  It should be repeated for the
    HL7 1.6 listener, which runs on a different port number.
  
    Example of using the HL PING option to test the new listener:
    =============================================================
  
 Select Filer and Link Management Options Option: PI  Ping (TCP Only)
 What HL Logical Link do you want to test?
 Select a TCP link:LISTENER 
 Do you want to PING the port used by HLO or the one used by HL7 1.6?
  
      Select one of the following:
  
           1         HLO     --> Port #5001
           2         HL7 1.6 --> Port #5000
  
 Enter response: 1//   HLO     --> Port #5001
 Trying to connect...
 Connected!
 Sending PING ...
 PING sent!
 Reading acknowledgment....
 Acknowledgment received!
