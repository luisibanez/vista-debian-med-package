Description:
============

  Patch HL*1.6*153 provides several Health Level Seven (HL7) and Health Level
 Seven Optimized (HLO) software enhancements and Data Dictionary changes, all of
 which are listed below.
  
 
 Software Enhancements
 ====================
 
 1) The 'Link Errors' [HL MENU FILER LINK ERR] menu option has been enhanced to
    improve its usefulness in troubleshooting issues with TCP links.  It
    includes these enhancements:
    a. The 'Clear a Queue of all Entries' [HL CLEAR QUEUE] option has been
       modified:
        * The Menu Text was changed to 'Purge Outgoing Queue (Non-TCP Only)'.
        * The option now allows only non-TCP entries in the HL LOGICAL LINK file
          (#870) to be selected.
    b. The 'Purge Outgoing Queue (TCP Only)' [HL PURGE QUEUE (TCP)] option is
       new.  It can be used to purge messages from an outgoing queue for
       TCP links only.  The messages are not deleted, just removed from the
       queue.
    c. The 'Display Client and Server Links (TCP Only)' [HL DISPLAY LINKS (TCP
       ONLY)] option is new.  It displays all of the incoming or outgoing
       queues that have pending  messages for all TCP links.  It includes
       a count of the messages pending on the queue and the state of the link
       as shown on the HL7 Systems Link Monitor. 
    d. The 'Display One Link (TCP Only)' [HL DISPLAY ONE LINK (TCP ONLY)] is
       new.  It allows the user to select a TCP link. It then displays that
       link in standard FileMan format, along with a count of messages pending
       on the incoming and outgoing queues for that link.  It will also 
       display the first message pending on the queues. 
    e. The 'Reset Link's Counters (TCP Only)' [HL RESET COUNTERS (TCP ONLY)]
       option is new.  It is used to reinitialize the counters shown on the 
       HL7 Systems Link Monitor for a single TCP link.
 2) There has been a long standing problem with queues for Mailman and Serial
    links occasionally becoming 'stuck'.  This problem has been corrected by
    making these changes:
     a.  A problem with record locking was discovered and corrected.
     b.  Unused 'stub' records placed on a queue will automatically be removed
         from the queue after a certain set period of time, determined by the
         new RETENTION TIME QUEUED STUB RCD field (#22) of the HL LOGICAL LINK
         file (#870).  The default time is 10 minutes.
 3) There has been a longstanding problem that prevented more than one outgoing
    filer from executing concurrently.  The problem was determined to be due
    to improper locking and has been corrected.  If desired, multiple outgoing
    filers can now be run.
 4) It was reported that occasionally multiple instances of the same event
    monitor were running concurrently.  This patch will stop that by
    requiring that each event monitor obtain an exclusive lock in order to run. 
 5) The 'LINK (870) CHECKS' entry in the HL Monitor file (#776.1) is
    deactivated. It is no longer needed since this patch fixes the problem
    with 'stuck' links that previously affected Mailman and serial links.
 6) The 'SERVER TRACE' [HLO SERVER TRACE] option and the 'CLIENT TRACE'
    [HLO CLIENT TRACE] options have been enhanced.  They will now display
    the raw data each time a READ is done over a TCP/IP connection.  That
    enhancement will allow the user to troubleshoot problems that prevent
    messages from being correctly parsed due to formatting problems.
 7) A spelling error was corrected that appeared on the 'HLO SYSTEM MONITOR'
    [HLO SYSTEM MONITOR] option screen.   The HLO listener, when stopped,
    would display the status misspelled as 'stoppped'.  
 8) The 'Purge Messages' [HL PURGE TRANSMISSIONS] option has been enhanced.
    The option will now treat incoming duplicate messages as completed
    messages and purge them in the standard timeframe.
 9) Two options have been deleted:
 
      HLO RECOUNT MESSAGE QUEUES  [HLO RECOUNT MESSAGE QUEUES]
      COUNT HL7 MESSAGE RECORDS   [HLO COUNT RECORDS]
 
    Previous to this patch, it was necessary to schedule these options
    on a regular basis in order to update the count of records found in
    files HLO MESSAGES (#778) and HLO MESSAGE BODY (#777), and also to 
    recount the messages pending on various HLO queues.  As of this patch
    HLO will automatically perform these actions on a regular basis without
    the need to schedule options.
 10) The second line of routine HLOUSR7 correctly includes only 
     patches HL*1.6*147 and HL*1.6*153.  Additional patches were incorrectly
     included in the second line by patch HL*1.6*147 and are being removed. 
 11) A bug in the SET OUTGOING QUEUE PRIORITY [HLO SET OUTGOING QUEUE
     PRIORITY] option has been fixed.  The option did not allow the priority
     of an HLO outgoing queue to be edited once the priority was initially
     set via this option. This patch fixes the option so that the priority
     can be edited.
 12) The Austin MPI reported that query responses were taking too long.
     After analysis, it was determined that the query responses could be
     speeded up by changing how long an in-filer process waited for a lock
     on an incoming queue.  The timeout was changed from 2 seconds to
     0 seconds. If the lock is not obtained immediately, it means that an
     in-filer process is already processing the queue and should not be
     waited on.
 13) It was reported that occasionally a site would begin transmitting
     an HL7 message via a MailMan link multiple times, resulting in many
     duplicate messages.  It was determined that this could occur if multiple
     client processes were running concurrently on the same MailMan link.
     The HL7 package will no longer allow multiple client processes to runn on
     the same MailMan link.  This was implemented by requiring that a MailMan
     client process obtain an exclusive lock on the link. 
 
 Data Dictionary Changes
 =======================
 1) These fields have been added to the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870):
    a. RETENTION TIME QUEUED STUB RCD (#22).  This field determines
       how long a stub record should be retained on a queue before
       it is removed.
    b. DATE/TIME STUB RCD FOUND (#10) in the OUT QUEUE (#20) subfile.
       If an unused stub record is removed from the queue the timestamp
       will be entered to this field.
    c. DATE/TIME STUB RCD FOUND (#10) in the IN QUEUE (#19) subfile.
       If an unused stub record is removed from the queue the timestamp
       will be entered to this field.
    d. The 'U' FOR UNUSED STUB RECORD code has been added to the STATUS 
       field (#1) of the IN QUEUE (#19) subfile.
    e. The 'U' FOR UNUSED STUB RECORD code has been added to the STATUS 
       field (#1) of the OUT QUEUE (#20) subfile.
 2) The MSH field (#200) of the HL7 MESSAGE ADMINISTRATION file (#773)
    has been modified to ignore the '|' character.  That change should
    cause the message header to display normally when doing a FileMan
    inquiry when '|' is used as one of the HL7 message delimiters. 
 3) The MESSAGE TEXT field (#200) of the HL7 MESSAGE TEXT file (#772)
    has been modified to ignore the '|' character.  That change should
    cause the message header to display normally when doing a FileMan
    inquiry when '|' is used as one of the HL7 message delimiters.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. It 
       is highly recommended to install the patch during off-hours. The
       installation will complete in less than one minute.
        
   2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO multi-listener running on
       all nodes in the cluster.
  
   3.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HL7 1.6 multi-listener running on
       all nodes in the cluster.
 
   4.  Use the STOP HLO option of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to temporarily
       stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several minutes to insure
       that all HLO processes have terminated.
 
   5.  Shutdown all Logical Links, incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management options listed below:
  
         Stop All Messaging Background Processes [HL STOP ALL]
  
   6.  Shutdown the Link Manager using the Filer and Link Management
       option listed below:
  
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
  
   7.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
  ** NOTE:  The second line of routine HLOUSR7 correctly includes only 
     patches HL*1.6*147 and HL*1.6*153.  Additional patches were incorrectly
     included in the second line by patch HL*1.6*147 and are being removed.
  
   8.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*153>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
  
   9. The post-install routine ^HLP153 will run automatically to
      deactivate the LINK (870) CHECKS' entry in the HL Monitor
      file (#776.1) and to update the HLO PROCESS REGISTRY file (#779.3).
      The routine should not be deleted i ncase the post-install needs to
      be run again.
  
      WARNING:  HLP153 SHOULD NOT BE DELETED.  IT WILL BE USED IF THE
      POST-INSTALL NEEDS TO BE RUN AGAIN.
   
   10. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO multi-listeners.
   
   11. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HL7 1.6 multi-listeners.
  
   12. Use the START HLO option within the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen
       to resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
       This step is optional in test systems. 
  
   13. Start up all Logical Links and incoming and outgoing filers using
       the Filer and Link Management Option's 'Restart/Start All Links
       and Filers [HL TASK RESTART]' menu option.
       (Note those links that do not have "autostart" enabled will need
       to be restarted manually.)
    
   14. Restart the Link Manager, that was shutdown in step 6, using the
       Filer and Link Management option listed below:
   
         TCP Link Manager Start/Stop [HL START/STOP LINK MANAGER]
