Associated patches: (v)HL*1.6*147  <<= must be installed BEFORE `HL*1.6*155'

Subject: HLO SINGLE THREADED CLIENT FLAG

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Patch HL*1.6*155 provides an enhancement to the VistA Health Level
 Seven Optimized software (HLO) that improves its performance
 for sending messages to a remote HL7 server that is single
 threaded.  This enhancement was requested by the Lab Reengineering
 application, but may be used to configure any interface that
 sends messages via HLO to a single threaded server.
 
 A new field is added to the HL Logical Link file (#870). The 
 field is SINGLE THREADED (#23).  It is a flag that should be
 set to YES if the HL Logical Link entry is for a server
 that is single threaded.   The effect of setting the flag
 is to guarantee that no more than one HLO client process at
 a time will attempt to open a connection to the server.  This
 field does NOT affect interfaces that do not use HLO.
  
 Support staff may set the new field via Fileman.  However, for
 application teams that need to release new entries in the 
 HL Logical Link file, there are two new APIs that may be used
 to set the flag, for example, in a post-installation routine.  
  
 
 New APIs:
 =========
 
 
  $$ONETHRED^HLOTLNK(LINKNAME)
  ============================
  Returns the value of the SINGLE THREADED flag (field #23) of an entry
  in the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870.
    
     Input:
        LINKNAME - (required) the name given to an entry in the HL LOGICAL
                   LINK file.
   
     Output:
        function return value - 1 if the SINGLE THREADED flag is set to YES,
                                otherwise it returns 0.
 
 
  $$STHREADS^HLOTLNK(LINKNAME,ON)
  ===============================
  This is used to turn on or off the SINGLE THREADED flag (field #23) of
  an entry in the HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870).
       
    Input:
       LINKNAME - (required) the name (.01 field) of an entry in the
               HL LOGICAL LINK file (#870).
       ON - (optional) A value of:  1 will set the flag.
                                    0 or "" will cause the flag to be deleted. 
                                    Not passed - same effect as "".
         
    Output:
       function return value - Returns the new value of the SINGLE THREADED flag,
                               or -1 if the inputs were invalid.

 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
  
    1.  Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
        Installation time is under 3 minutes.  
        
    2.  Disable the HL7 TCPIP services for the HLO multi-listener running on
        all nodes in the cluster. For example, at the VMS prompt in your
        production account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP          <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE  
  
          In your test account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP          <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5026CACHE  
  
         You could also do this from the M programmer's prompt as follows:
   
         VISTA> D ^%CLI   <-- at the M programmer's prompt                       
         CLI command: TCPIP                 
         TCPIP> DISABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE  
  
    3.  Use the STOP HLO option of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to temporarily
        stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several minutes to insure 
        that all HLO processes have terminated.
        
  
    4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
        option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
    5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
        The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
        the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
        options:
  
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
  
           Print Transport Global 
  
           Compare Transport Global to Current System 
  
           Backup a Transport Global
  
           Install Package(s) 
  
        When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the patch
        build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions, and the
        answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*155>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install?  <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install?  <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
  
          and Protocols?  <NO>
   
       A pre-install routine will verify that all HLO processes have been
       stopped before the installation will complete. 
   
  
    6. Enable the HL7 TCPIP services for the multi-listeners
  
          For example, in a production account at the VMS prompt:
          ISC6A1> TCPIP             <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE 
  
          For example, in a test account:
  
          ISC6A1> TCPIP             <-- at the VMS prompt
          TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5026CACHE 
  
         You could also do this from the M programmer's prompt as follows:
  
         VISTA> D ^%CLI   <-- at the M programmer's prompt                       
         CLI command: TCPIP
         TCPIP> ENABLE SERVICE HLS5001CACHE   
  
    
    7. Use the START HLO option within the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen
       to resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
       This step is optional in test systems.
   
    8. On production systems, verify that outgoing messages have resumed
       being transmitted.  You can do this by monitoring the system via the
       HLO System Monitor for a few minutes to insure that the count of
       messages pending transmission is not growing.
