Subject: HLO QUEUE FOR INCOMING APP ACK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch changes how the HLO server determines the input queue to place an
  incoming application acknowledgment message.   The server will follow these
  rules:
  
    1) If the application specified an outgoing queue for the original
       message, then the returning application acknowledgment will be placed
       on a queue with the same name. 
 
       For example, if the original message was placed on an outgoing queue
       named 'MPI 1', then the application acknowledgement that is returned
       will be placed on an incoming queue named 'MPI 1'.
 
     2) When the original message was generated, the sending application may
        or may not have specified the routine to process the returning
        application acknowledgment.  If not, then the server will look
        up the routine in the HLO APPLICATION REGISTRY file (#779.2).
        In that case, the server will also look there for the name of the
        queue to place the incoming application acknowledgment. 
  
     3) If the queue is not determined by rules 1) or 2), then the message
        will be placed on the incoming queue named 'DEFAULT'. 
 
  
    Note: This change was requested for the Austin MPI, which receives a
   large volume of application acknowledgments, resulting in a backlog of the
   'DEFAULT' queue.  This change will cause the messages to be distributed
   over many queues, thus eliminating or at least diminishing the backlog to
   the default queue.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  The
      installation will complete in less than one minute.
  
   2. For VMS sites, it is NOT necessary to disable any of the VMS TCPIP
      Services.
  
   3.  Use the STOP HLO option of the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen to temporarily
       stop the transmission of HLO messages. Wait several minutes to insure
       that all HLO processes have terminated.(It is NOT necessary to
       stop the HL7 1.6 logical links, filers, or any other of the
       HL7 1.6 background processes.)
  
   4.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   5.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you may be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <HL*1.6*152>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
   
   6. Verify that the install completed.
  
   7. Use the START HLO option within the HLO SYSTEM MONITOR screen
      to resume transmission of HLO messages in your production account.
      This step is optional in test systems.
