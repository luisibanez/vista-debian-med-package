 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
   
 1. HD0000000321137 - Unable to Run Detailed Report  Error in PSBOSF
    
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to run the "Unable to Scan Detailed Report", the code 
 attempts to store a large amount of information in a local array, causing an 
 RPC Broker Error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOSF was modified to store Report Information in a Temporary Global 
 instead of an Array, hence eliminating the broker error.
  
  
 2. HD0000000410010 - Incorrect start and stop date/time for one-time meds
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When the "Missed Medications" report is run for a Ward which contains two
 patients with the same PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) UNIT DOSE (#.06) IEN (INTERNAL
 ENTRY NUMBER), and a schedule type of One-Time, the same start and stop 
 times will display for both orders on the report, even though they should be
 different.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOMM was modified to include the Patient DFN (Data File 
 Number) in the PSBSTXT and PSBSTXP arrays so the start and stop date/time
 will not be overwritten for patients with the same order number.
  
 3. HD000000455224 - Comment associated to multiple patients in
                         missing med report
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 ---------------------
 PSPO #1946
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the "Missed Medications" report is run for a Ward which contains two
 patients with the same PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) UNIT DOSE (#.06) IEN,
 multiple errors will occur on the report if one med is marked Held with a 
 comment entered, and the other is marked given.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOMM was modified to include the Patient DFN in the PSBG array so
 the Admin Status and Comment will not be copied to a patient with the
 same PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) UNIT DOSE (#.06) IEN.
      
 4. HD000000353145 - Requesting correction to BCMA error message display
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Error Message "Error(s) Filing Transactions MEDPASS" is not helpful to
 the end user.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBML was modified to add detail to the error message including
 the type of error that occurred, and the field and file names in which the
 Error occurred.
