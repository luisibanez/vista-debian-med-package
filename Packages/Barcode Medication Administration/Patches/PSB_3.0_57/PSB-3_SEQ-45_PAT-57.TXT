Subject: BCMA MAH CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Patch addresses 3 issues:
  
 1. The BCMA Medication Administration History (MAH) report does not line
    up the action taken on a medication with the scheduled time of that
    administration.
  
 2. The BCMA MAH displays active medications on hold when an order is 
    placed on Provider Hold, an additional action is taken (such as Flag),
    and then the order is taken off Provider Hold.
  
 3. When an order is created with a start date of today and a first
    scheduled administration time of tomorrow, the BCMA MAH shows a
    medication as scheduled to be given today.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
   
 1. HD0000000382261 - med admin history does not reflect admin in sync 
                      with  actual administration time
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1648
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a medication has multiple scheduled administration times on a
    single day, the actual administrations do not sync with the scheduled
    administration time on the MAH.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines PSBOMH1 to lineup the action taken on a medication
    with the scheduled administration time of the medication on the
    Medication Administration History Report.
    Note - This resolution will not apply to IV medications that do not
    contain an Administration Time or Unit Dose medications that have a
    dosage form of 'patch'. 
  
 2. HD00000000278808 - MAH shows active meds on HOLD
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a medication is placed on Provider Hold in Inpatient Meds, and 
    another action is taken on that order, such as Flagging the order, the
    order will continue to display as Held on the BCMA MAH after the order
    is taken off Provider Hold.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMH was modified to set a flag when the order is taken off
    Provider Hold, and check for that flag when running the report.
  
 3. HD00000000446339 - MAH does not capture correct start date
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an order is created in Inpatient Meds with a start date of today
    and a first scheduled administration of tomorrow, the order will appear
    on the MAH as to be given today.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMH was modified to star out today's administration if the
    first scheduled admin is not until tomorrow.
