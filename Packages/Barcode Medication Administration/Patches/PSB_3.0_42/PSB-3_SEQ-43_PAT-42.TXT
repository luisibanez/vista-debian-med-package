Subject: BCMA IHS PARAMETER/508 COMPLIANCE

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
 executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately after 
 the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
  
 This enhancement is intended to enable the BCMA application to recognize 
 whether it is operating in the Indian Health Service (IHS) or Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA) environment, and respond by recognizing and 
 displaying the patient identifier appropriate to the environment.  
  
 BCMA GUI Version 42 has been tested with CPRS GUI Version 27 using the 
 CCOW functionality. The test sites have found that CCOW is working as 
 expected in BCMA and have not reported any defects or anomalies during 
 the testing. Per the Patient Safety Office and Bar Code Resource Office, 
 sites may now enable CCOW by removing "/NOCCOW" from the Target field of 
 the BCMA GUI Shortcut.
  
 Please review the BCMA V.3.0 User Manual - Appendix C (CCOW) located at 
 the VA Software Document Library at:
         http://www4.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=84
  
  
 Please see the Release Notes for more details on the following 
 enhancements.
  
 1. Enhancement: This will enable a single version of BCMA to be 
    maintained by VHA and yet be installed and operate in a "plug and play"
    fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility running Resource and Patient
    Management System (RPMS). 
  
 2. Enhancement: The BCMA Graphical User Interface (GUI) will display 
    vital measurements from the Veterans Administration (VA)
    VITALS/MEASUREMENTS package for VHA sites or optionally use the 
    IHS PCC SUITE (APC) package which supports the V MEASURMENT file, if
    operating at an IHS facility and that facility is configured to use the
    V MEASUREMENT file.
  
 3. Enhancement: All forms on the Unit Dose, IVP/IVPB and IV VDL Tabs have 
    been updated to conform to Section 508 compliance standards. The
    Coversheet has been excluded for now.
  
 4. Enhancement: GUI Help Text Content has been updated to the current 
    functionality.
  
  
 This Patch also Addresses 7 reported issues:
  
 1. PSI-07-223 (PSPO-823) - If an IV order is already infusing when it is
    placed on provider hold, the IV can be stopped and then infused again 
    while still on provider hold.
 2. PSPO-1678 - The MULTIPLE DOSE pop up form blocks the dosage on the 
    Virtual Due List (VDL).
 3. All BCMA reports have a default date based on the Laptop Time instead 
    of the Server Time.
 4. The MedLog form in BCMA will accept a space for the required comment.
 5. 3 Missing Dose request reasons are missing from the Reason drop down 
    box on the BCMA Missing Dose form.
 6. Remove the obsolete Scratch HFS Directory from the BCMA Parameters GUI.
 7. The units ordered do not display on the BCMA Medication Log report 
    when a missing dose is requested and the order is held and then given.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
  
 1.  HD0000000221177 - BCMA order problem messages-replicating
  
  
  Problem:
  --------
  PSI-07-223 (PSPO-823) - If an IV order is already infusing when it is
  placed on provider hold, the IV can be stopped and then infused
  again while still on provider hold.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI file ScanIV.pas was modified to remove "Infusing" as option
  from the "Select an Option" drop down box when the order is on
  provider hold.  Also, the text "This order is on Provider hold!" was
  added to the "Order Changes" box.
  
 2.  HD00000000390027 - MULTI TAB DOSE POPUP BLOCKS DOSAGE
  
  Problem:
  --------
  PSPO-1678 - The MULTIPLE DOSE pop up form blocks the dosage ordered
  on the Virtual Due List (VDL).
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI files MultipleDrugs.pas and MultipleDrugs.frm were modified
  to add the field Dosage Ordered to the form.
  
 3.  HD00000000293514 - BCMA order problem messages-replicating
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The original problem reported was an infinite loop causing thousands
  of Mailman messages to be sent out when an invalid Mumps date (a
  date prior to 12/31/1845) was passed in from the BCMA GUI when
  running the Administration Times Report.  The invalid date was passed
  because the user had a laptop time prior to 12/31/1845 and BCMA
  reports default time is based on the Laptop time instead of the Server
  time.  PSB*3*56 corrects the error of the infinite loop.  This patch will
  change the default time of all BCMA reports to the server time instead
  of the laptop time.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI file ReportRequest.pas was modified to base the default time for
  all reports on the server time.
  
 4.  HD00000000102421 - Comment will accept a space
  
  Problem:
  --------
  When an order is given outside of the Allowable Time Limit,
  the Med Log form will allow a space to be entered for the required
  comment field.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI file MedLog.pas was modified to require a valid character in
  the comment field before OK can be clicked.
  
 5.  HD00000000380321 - options missing from Missing Dose Request
                        Reason drop down list
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Problem - Package Integrity Damaged, Package Contents Damaged and
  Barcode/IEN Illegible are missing from the Missing Dose Request Reasons
  Drop Down.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI file MissingDose.frm was modified to add Package Integrity
  Damaged, Package Contents Damaged and Barcode/IEN Illegible to the
  Missing Dose Request Reasons Drop Down.
  
 6.  HD00000000380330 - Remove Scratch HFS Directory field from BCMA
                        Parameters
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Scratch HFS Directory still displays on the BCMA Parameters GUI,
  even though this field is now obsolete.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI files BCMAParmeters.pas and BCMAParmeters.frm were modified
  to remove the Scratch HFS Directory from the BCMA Parameters GUI.
  
 7.  HD00000000235723 - Units given does not show up on Log
  
  Problem:
  --------
  If a missing dose is requested for an IVPB and the order is marked as
  held, and the order is then given, the Units ordered do not show on the
  Med Log.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  DELPHI file BCMA_Objects.pas and Mumps routine PSBML2 were modified
  To display the "units ordered" for all given orders.

   1. Prior client compatible with patch:  NO
   2. Client can be copied instead of installed:  YES
   3. Is your site running the CareFusion Wireless Medication
      Administration (WMA) software? If YES, please contact Carefusion to
      ensure your site has the latest compatible WMA patch.
  
   BCMA.LOG Error Handling:
  
 Prior to installation, ensure that the following conditions are met for 
 the current user:
         - can create C:\TEMP directory
         - C:\TEMP directory permits user to create files
         - if the C:\TEMP\BCMA.LOG file exists, the user can write/append 
           to that file.  
  
   If the above conditions are not met, BCMA will generate an error and 
   exit immediately.
  
   RESOLUTION: If your site is still experiencing an issue with the 
               BCMA.LOG file, one of the following resolutions can be used.
  
    1. IRMs must ensure that BCMA users have rights to create 
       C:\TEMP and to create and store files in the C:\TEMP directory. 
  
    If the user is able to create C:\TEMP and is still experiencing issues,
    delete the BCMA.LOG file and if necessary, delete the C:\TEMP 
    directory.  
  
    When BCMA is first run, it will create the C:\TEMP directory and create
    the BCMA.LOG file in that directory as needed.  
  
    2. Append " /NOLOGFILE" in the target field of the BCMA shortcut after 
       the port number. 
  
         Note: a blank space must be entered before the "/" in the target 
               field.
  
  
    Note:  Use Binary mode to retrieve the .EXE file.
  
    To obtain the updated .EXE, use FTP to retrieve PSB3_0P42.EXE (4,000
    KB) from one of the following OI Field Offices' ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
    directories:
  
     OI Field Office   FTP Address                Directory
     VA-wide           download.vista.med.va.gov  anonymous.software

     Salt Lake City    ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov      anonymous.software
  
    If BCMA is currently running, please exit BCMA. This client
    installation patch file can be used to upgrade an existing version of
    BCMA, or can be used for a brand new installation.
  
     1. Double Click on PSB3_0P42.EXE which will launch the InstallShield
        Wizard.
  
     2. When the InstallShield Wizard Welcome screen is displayed, click
        "Next".
  
     3. On the Choose Destination Location screen, simply click "Next"
        If you would like to change the destination folder to one other
        than default, click "Browse" to navigate to the folder of your
        choice. Click "Next".
  
     4. On the "Setup Type" Screen select one of the following:
              a. Typical - installs only the BCMA client program
                 which is necessary for medication administration.
              b. Complete - installs the BCMA client and the
                 GUI BCMA site parameters definition program.
              c. Custom - allows you to select which programs to install

     5. The InstallShield Wizard Ready to Install the Program screen
        will display. Click "Install" to proceed with the installation.
  
     6. The InstallShield Wizard Complete screen will be displayed.
        Click "Finish" and the BCMA installation is now complete.
  
  
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 1. The preferred method is to FTP the files from

    the first available FTP server.
  
 2. Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
    specific server as follows:
  
     Albany           ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
     Hines            ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
     Salt Lake City   ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 3. Documentation can also be retrieved from VISTA Documentation Library
    (VDL) on the Internet at the following address, http://www.va.gov/vdl.
