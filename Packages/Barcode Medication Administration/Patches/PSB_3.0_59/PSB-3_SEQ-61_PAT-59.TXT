Subject: BCBU MAR DISPLAY ISSUES (ALPHA SORT MEDS, REMOVE THE '&') 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 4 issues:
  
 1. A site noticed an issue when using the Bar Code Medication 
    Administration Backup System (BCBU). Current patients within a unit,
    who do not have current active medication orders, will not display on
    the BCBU Medication Administration Report (MAR) while using the Print
    MAR for a Selected Ward (PW) menu option or the Print MAR for All
    Wards (PA) menu option.
  
 2. The BCBU MAR currently displays an ampersand (&) symbol followed by 
    the administration times in the "Give: " line of the report. The 
    "Give: " line is for displaying the dosage amounts and schedules
    of the patient's medications only. This additional information was
    added for Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and was never
    intended to display in the BCBU MAR reports.
  
 3. Sites have noticed that the BCBU MAR does not list the patients 
    medication names in alphabetical order for the three main print MAR 
    options which could potentially harm certain patients.
  
 4. Currently when printing a BCBU MAR report asterisks appear for PRN   
    medications that were ordered on the same day the MAR report was
    printed.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. INC0000000270121 - Patient with no active meds does not print
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    Sites noticed when using the Bar Code Medication Administration
    Backup System (BCBU) that current patients within a unit, who
    do not have current active medication orders, will not display
    on the BCBU Medication Administration Report (MAR) while using the
    Print MAR for a Selected Ward (PW) menu option or the Print MAR for
    All Wards (PA) menu option. The sites were expecting a MAR to print
    the patient's informational header and footer since the menu option
    Print MAR for Selected Patient (PP) prints the header and footer
    only if the patient has no current active medication orders. 
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines ALPBPPAT, ALPBPWRD, and ALPBPALL have been modified to
    give BCBU users the option to include patients without active
    medication orders on the BCBU MAR with a new prompt:
    "Include Patients Without Active Medications? YES//". 
    
    
 2. INC0000000286996 - 5 BCMA Contingency display problem
    
    Problem:
    --------  
    The BCBU MAR currently displays the ampersand (&) symbol followed by 
    the administration times in the "Give: " line of the report. This
    additional information was added for Computerized Patient Record
    System (CPRS) and was never intended to display in the BCBU MAR
    reports. The "Give: " line is for displaying the dosage amounts
    and schedules of the patient's medications only.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ALPBHL1U has been modified to remove the ampersand (&)
    symbol and administration times before storing the schedule for 
    display on the BCBU MAR. This change will only correct future
    medication orders on the BCBU MAR that are done after the 
    installation of this patch.
    
    
 3. INC0000000211122 - Report does not list drugs alphabetically
    
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #00000876
  
    Problem:
    --------  
    Currently the options Print MAR for ALL Wards [PSB BCBU PRINT MAR 
    ALL], Print Mar for Selected Patient [PSB BCBU PRINT MAR PATIENT],
    and Print Mar for Selected Ward [PSB BCBU PRINT MAR WARD] do not 
    display patient's medications in alphabetical order.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines ALPBPALL, ALPBPPAT, and ALPBPWRD to sort the
    medications by the ORDER TYPE first (unit dose, unit dose PRN,
    intravenous, and intravenous PRN), then arranged in alphabetical
    order by the DRUG NAME, followed by the ORDER STATUS, and the
    ORDER NUMBER.
  
  
 4. INC0000000727979 - MAR PRN ASTERISK ERROR
  
    Problem:
    --------  
    Currently future PRN medication orders are displaying on the BCBU MAR with
    asterisks printed in the box for the first date the drug is able to be
    administered.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine ALPBFRM1 to account for medication orders that do not
    have administration times included with the administration dates.
