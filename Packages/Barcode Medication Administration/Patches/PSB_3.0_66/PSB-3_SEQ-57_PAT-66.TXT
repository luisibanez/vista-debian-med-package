 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================   
 1. HD0000000476258 - The IVPB 
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2012
  
    Problem:
    --------
    IV Bag Parameters are not required to be defined for a division which 
    contains active wards.  Because there are no default parameters
    required, invalid IV bags may be administered.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBPOIV was modified to use the default IV Bag Parameters if no
    IV Bag Parameters are defined.  Also, routine PSBRPC was modified to
    send a Mailman message to the holder of the PSB MANAGER key, requesting
    that they set up the IV Bag Parameters for the division.
  
 2. HD00000000525060 - After Multiple edits of solutions still give
                       old bags in BCMA
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When making multiple edits to the solution of an IV bag, any label
    printed after the time of the first edit will be valid.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBPOIV was modified to check for all edits and only allow
    labels to be scanned which were printed after the last edit.
  
    NOTES:
    ------
    Routines APSPFUNC and BEHOVM called from PSBRPC are Indian Health
    Services only routines and will display as an XINDEX error when
    installing this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality was
    introduced by patch PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to enable
    the BCMA application to recognize whether it is operating in the Indian
    Health Service (IHS) or Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
    environment, and respond by recognizing and displaying the patient
    identifier appropriate to the environment. This will enable a single
    version of BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be installed and
    operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility
    running Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).
  
    If your site is accustomed to running D ^XINDEX after the patch 
     Installation, you will receive the following:
  
     Compiled list of Errors and Warnings

    This is due to the routines for Indian Health Services described 
    above, and does not affect the functionality of this patch for VA
    sites.
