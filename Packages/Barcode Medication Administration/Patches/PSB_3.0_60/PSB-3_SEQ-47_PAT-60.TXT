Subject: COVERSHEET ERROR, MEDICATION VARIANCE REPORT CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 3 issues:
  
 1. The  error "<SUBSCRIPT>ADM+3^PSBCSUTX" occurs
    when selecting the BCMA Coversheet tab if the patient
    only has IV Orders and no Unit Dose Orders.
  
 2. The BCMA Medication Variance Report does not paginate
    correctly.
  
 3. The BCMA Medication Variance Report displays a variance
    when a patch is removed, even if the patch was given on
    time.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
   
 1. HD0000000454396 - SUBSCRIPT ERROR ADM+3^PSBCSUTX
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When selecting the Coversheet Tab in BCMA, a subscript error
    occurs if the patient has only IV (No Unit Dose) medications, and
    at least one of the orders is expired. This causes BCMA to shut down.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Additional expired date checks were added to routine PSBCSUTL
    before calling ADD^PSBVDLU1.  An additional check was added
    to verify that an order has actually been added to ^TMP("PSB") before
    adding a node with the text "END" to the global.
  
 2. HD00000000315072 - Medication Variance Log report not 
                       paginating correctly
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA Medication Variance report only prints a header with a
    new page number after all orders for a patient have been printed.
    This causes the report not to paginate properly when a patient has more
    than one page of data.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMV was modified to check if a page break is needed 
    after each order is printed.
  
 3. HD00000000453423 - Nicotine Patch with variance
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If there is a variance in the data/time recorded in the 
    ACTION DATE/TIME (#.06) field of the BCMA MED LOG
    (#53.79) file and the date/time recorded in DATE/TIME
    OF OCCURRENCE (#.04) field in the BCMA MEDICATION 
    VARIANCE LOG (#53.78) due to system lag, the BCMA 
    Medication Variance Report displays a variance for the 
    time the patch is removed.  The Variance report should
    only display variances for the "Given" action of a patch.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMV was modified to allow for a variance up to
    the value of the system variable DILOCKTM in the time
    difference between ACTION DATE/TIME and the BCMA 
    MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG.  If the system variable DILOCKTM
    is not set, the allowed variance will be 3 seconds.  If, due to
    unusually slow processing speeds, the variance between the
    ACTION DATE/TIME (#.06) field of the BCMA MED LOG
    (#53.79) file and the date/time recorded in DATE/TIME
    OF OCCURRENCE (#.04) field in the BCMA MEDICATION 
    VARIANCE LOG (#53.78) falls outside the value of DILOCKTM,  
    the Variance will display on the MEDICATION VARIANCE LOG.
