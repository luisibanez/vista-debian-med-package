Subject: IV BAG DETAIL, NO LEADING 0 IN PRN EFFECTIVENESS, SPACEBAR-ENTER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 4 issues:
  
 1. The PSB BAG DETAIL RPC is returning duplicate entries for
    a single action, causing the action to be displayed twice in
    the "IV Bag Detail" section of the BCMA IV Tab.
  
 2. The message "Error @ -100" is seen in the "IV Bag Detail"
    section  on the BCMA IV Tab if a site has the optional AU05 
    cross reference turned on.
  
 3. The Units Given fields on the PRN Effectiveness Log and the
    BCMA Medication Log forms omit the leading zero if the 
    Units Given field value is a decimal less than one.
  
 4. BCMA is accepting "Spacebar/Enter" as valid input for scanning a 
    Drug IEN and returning the last medication the user scanned.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
  
 1. HD00000000423740 - PSB BAG DETAIL RPC returning
                        multiple entries
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The PSB BAG DETAIL RPC is returning duplicate entries for a 
    single action, causing the action to be displayed twice in the
    "IV Bag Detail" section of the BCMA IV Tab.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBRPC2 was modified to only order through the
    AUDIT LOG (#.9) sub-file of the BCMA MED LOG (#53.79) 
    file once, thus eliminating the possibility of duplicate entries.
  
 2. HD0000000353544 - Error @ -100 seen in details 
                      section for IVs.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The message "Error @ -100" is seen in the "IV Bag Detail"
    section on the BCMA IV Tab if a site has the optional AU05 cross 
    reference turned on. This cross reference creates an additional 
    entry in the AUDIT LOG (#.9) subfile of the BCMA MED LOG 
    (#53.79) file.  The code is expecting an "Action Status" entry,
    but finding an "Entered By" entry.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBRPC2 was modified to verify the first entry 
    in the Audit Log is for an "Action Status". Otherwise,
    the routine will continue ordering through the log until it 
    finds the first 'Action Status" entry, thus accounting 
    for any additional entries that are created by optional cross
    references.
  
 3. HD0000000422594 - PRN Order Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Units Given field on the PRN Effectiveness Log and BCMA
    Medication Log omits the leading zero if the value of Units 
    Given field is a decimal less than one.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines PSBPRN and PSBVDLVL were modified to add a leading 
    zero to the Units Given field if the value is a decimal less
    than 1.
  
 4. HD0000000478858 - BCMA is accepting a "spacebar/enter"
                      while scanning a drug
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2015
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When manually scanning a medication in the BCMA GUI, a value
    of spacebar/enter is permitted and will return the last medication
    the user scanned from the DRUG (#50) file.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBRPC2 was modified to return the error message
    "Invalid Medication Lookup.  DO NOT GIVE!! " if an empty
    string is passed into VistA from the BCMA GUI.
