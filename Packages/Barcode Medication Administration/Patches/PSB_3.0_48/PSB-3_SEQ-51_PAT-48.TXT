Description:
============

  *************************Important Note***********************************
  If the site is running the BCMA Contingency software then this patch
  must also be installed on the workstations. Once installed it is suggested
  that the sites review the Contingency system reports.
  **************************************************************************
  
 This patch addresses the following four issues:
 1. Future medication orders display on the Bar Code Medication
    Administration Backup System (BCBU) Medication Administration Record (MAR)
    as current. An asterisk should be displaying in the administration time
    fields until the actual start dates have been reached. 
  
 2. Held medications are currently being displayed on the BCBU MAR option 
    Print MAR for a Selected Patient. Held medications should not be
    displayed on the BCBU MAR report. PSPO# 1613
  
 3. A prompt and help message under the BCMA Backup System 
    [PSB BCBU WRKSTN MAIN] option is currently not displaying properly
    or consistently among the following three BCBU MAR print options 
    Print MAR for All Wards, Print MAR for Selected Patient, and Print MAR 
    for Selected Ward.
  
 4. While using Room/Bed sort in the BCMA Backup System (Wrkstn) option 
    Print MAR for Selected Ward, the system produces an error if a patient
    has no Room or Bed assigned.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000336762 - Future order showing on Contingency MAR
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    Future medication orders are displaying on the BCBU MAR for each of the 
    print report options (Print MAR for All Wards, Print MAR for Selected 
    Patient, and Print MAR for Selected Ward) as current medications that 
    need to be given. The date/time boxes are not displaying with an asterisk.
    Asterisks should display in the administration time fields until the 
    actual start dates have been reached.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine ALPBFRM1 which will now add asterisks to the
    BCBU MAR if the patient's medication start dates are in the future. 
    The report will continue to display asterisks in the date/time
    boxes for administrations until the medication start date/time
    is reached.  
  
  
 2. HD0000000339368 - Hold Meds being displayed on BC/BU 
    
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1613
  
    Problem:   
    --------  
    Held Medications are currently being displayed on the BCBU MAR Print 
    option Print MAR for a Selected Patient.  Held medications should not
    display on this report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine ALPBPPAT which will now stop medications from 
    printing if the medications have a status of 'HD' (or held) when users
    choose to print the BCBU MAR for selected patients.
  
  
 3. HD0000000160805 - Errors
  
    Problem:   
    --------  
    A prompt and help message in VistA under the BCMA Backup System 
    [PSB BCBU WRKSTN MAIN] option is currently not displaying properly
    or consistently among the following three BCBU MAR print options 
    Print MAR for All Wards, Print MAR for Selected Patient, and Print MAR 
    for Selected Ward. The prompt asks the user "Print how many days MAR?".
    The number of acceptable days should be from 1 to 7, however the system 
    currently displays 3 to 7.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines ALPBPWRD, ALPBPPAT, and ALPBPALL to only accept the
    default number of days 1 to 7. This also makes the three BCBU MAR print
    options consistent.
  
  
 4. HD0000000439582 - Print MAR for Selected Ward sort issues
  
    Problem:
    --------  
    While using the Print MAR for Selected Ward option under the option name
    BCMA Backup System (Wrkstn) [PSB BCBU WRKSTN MAIN] the system is currently 
    producing a SUBSCRIPT error.  This error occurs if a patient has not 
    been assigned a Room or Bed when using the Room/Bed option for the sort
    question 'Sort Patients by [N]ame or [R]oom/Bed?'.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine ALPBPWRD which now processes the users response to
    the 'Sort Patients by [N]ame or [R]oom/Bed?' question without error.
