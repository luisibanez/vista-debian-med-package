Subject: DISAPPEARING UNKNOWN ACTION, FATAL ERROR in BCMA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 3 issues:
 
 1.  An order with an Unknown Action status is unavailable
     when using the Edit Med Log option if another user runs
     the BCMA Medication Administration History (MAH) report.
 2.  A broker error occurs when using the Unable to Scan function
     in BCMA and then scanning another medication. 
 3.  A broker error occurs when clicking on the BCMA Coversheet if 
     a patient's only current order is an IV Piggyback which has a
     day of the week schedule.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
   
 1.      HD0000000418230 - Disappearing Unknown Action Status
 
 Problem:
 --------
 An order with an Unknown Action status is unavailable
 when using the Edit Med Log option if another user runs
 the BCMA Medication Administration History (MAH) report.
 The administration will not be available until the user who
 ran the report closes their session. 
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBOMH1 was modified to remove the incremental lock
 from the code.  The report is only reading from the BCMA 
 MEDICATION LOG (#53.79) file, not writing to it, so the lock
 is not needed.
 
 2.     HD00000000798826 - FILESF+11^PSBVDLU3 *PSBMEDOI
 
 Problem:
 --------
 A fatal "Undefined" error will occur in BCMA when the Unable to
 Scan function is used, and then a medication is scanned.
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBVDLU3 was modified to clean up the variable PSBFILE when
 exiting the PSBVDLU3 routine, which will prevent the undefined error.
 
 3.     HD00000000466070 - <UNDEFINED>QUT+3^PSBCSUTY
 
 Problem:
 --------
 A fatal error occurs when clicking on the BCMA Coversheet if
 a patient's only current order is an IV Piggyback which has a day of the 
 week schedule.  The error will cause BCMA to shut down and need
 to be restarted.  The error will continue to occur until another order
 is created or the order is marked "Given".  The error occurred because
 the % variable containing the current date/time was killed in a previous
 routine.
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSBCSUTY was modified to set the % variable to the current date
 and time.
