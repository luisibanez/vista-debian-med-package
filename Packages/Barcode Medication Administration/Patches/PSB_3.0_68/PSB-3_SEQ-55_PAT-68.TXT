 ******************************* ATTENTION ********************************
   
 IMR4 UNLIMITED SI/OPI TEXT, LAST INJECTION SITE enhancement includes 4 
 patches which must be installed in the following order:
  
 1.      PSS*1*171
 2.      PSJ*5*267
 3.      PSB*3*68
 4.      PSB*3*69
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately after
 the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
 This version of BCMA was successfully tested in the field against Wireless
 Medication Administration version 4.8 at Pittsburgh and Loma Linda.
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
 The Special Instructions and Other Print Info Project addresses 
 enhancements identified during Inpatient Medications Requirements for 
 Special Focus Group Initial Request Analysis (IMR SFG IRA) Phase 
 III/Phase IV, as well as modifications requested by the Bar Code
 Medication Administration (BCMA) and Inpatient Medications workgroups.  
  
 The Inpatient Pharmacy patch PSJ*5*267 is also being released as part of
 these enhancements.  The projects purpose is to Standardize the character
 length between CPRS Provider's Comment, Inpatient Medications Special
 Instructions, and the IV Pharmacy Other Print Information fields.
  
 The Inpatient Pharmacy patch PSJ*5*267 will add new fields to Inpatient 
 Medication to support an unlimited amount of text for Special 
 Instructions and Other Print Info (SI/OPI). 
  
 1. BCMA Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) will be modified to send over the new
    Inpatient Medications SI/OPI fields in an unlimited format to the BCMA
    GUI client.
  
 2. For backwards compatibility, of existing Active orders on file that
    were using the old fixed length SI/OPI fields, then this information 
    will be included in the new unlimited format also.
  
 3. Modify the following reports to print the unlimited SI/OPI information:
     a. Medication Administration History (MAH) Report
     b. Display Order detail Report
     c. Due List Report
     d. IV Bag Status Report
     e. Cover Sheet Report - Medication Overview Report
     f. Cover Sheet Report - PRN Overview Report
     g. Cover Sheet Report - IV Overview Report
     h. Cover Sheet Report - Expired/DC'd/Expiring Report
     i. BCMA Backup System (BCBU) Print MAR for All Wards
     j. BCMA Backup System (BCBU) Print MAR for Selected Patient
     k. BCMA Backup System (BCBU) Print MAR for Selected Ward
  
 4. Add new check box field to allow if the unlimited text will be printed
    on the following reports:
     a. Due List Report
     b. IV Bag Status Report
     c. Cover Sheet Report - Medication Overview Report
     d. Cover Sheet Report - PRN Overview Report
     e. Cover Sheet Report - IV Overview Report
     f. Cover Sheet Report - Expired/DC'd/Expiring Report
  
 5. BCMA Client:
     a. Added window to display unlimited Special Instructions / Other
        Print Info via menu, right-click, and function key (F6).  This
        window is also used to display Special Instructions / Other Print
        Info when an order is flagged in Inpatient Medications and is given
        in BCMA.
     b. Fields which displayed Special Instructions / Other Print Info in
        forms were widened to 80 characters and have vertical scroll.
     c. Added Last Injections Site column to the Unit Dose VDL to show what
        the last site was per Orderable item.
     d. Enhanced the Injection Site dialog window to show two 
        history tables.
           1) To show the last 4 sites per the medication being given.
           2) To show last 10 sites per the patient for any medication.
       The tables above will use a new Division parameter, "Injection Site 
       History Max Hours", added with this patch that controls how many
       hours to look back when compiling these history tables.  The default
       will be initialized to 72 hours, with this patch.
  
 This Patch also Addresses 3 reported Remedy ticket issues:
  
 1. After scanning a medication that requires multiple doses
    or dosage strengths, the multiple dose dialog box's 
    invalid medication pop-up functionality appears to be broken.
 2. Unable to view all allergies/ADRs on BCMA GUI for patient with
    numerous allergies/ADRs.
 3. The Patient Record Flag changes from Red to Black if you lock
    your computer. 
  
 Please refer to the release notes for a full detailed list and examples 
 of items included in this patch.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
  
 1.  HD0000000336419 - Comment lengths between CPRS and Pharmacy
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The feature "Copy Provider Comments into Special Instruction" is 
  truncating comments that exceed 180 characters.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The Inpatient Pharmacy patch PSJ*5*267 will add new fields to Inpatient

  Instructions and Other Print Info (SI/OPI).  BCMA has been modified
  to handle these changes.
  
 2.  HD0000000480879 - PSB*58:  BCMA IMR 3 Sprint 1
  
  Problem:
  --------
  After scanning a medication that requires multiple doses or dosage
  strengths, the multiple dose dialog box's invalid medication pop-up
  functionality appears to be broken.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Delphi file MultipleDrugs.pas was modified to display the "Invalid
  Medications" popup whenever an invalid dose is scanned.
  
 3.  HD0000000488494 - Unable to view all allergies/ADRs on BCMA GUI for
                       patient with numerous allergies/ADRs.
  Problem:
  --------
  For patients with more than one line of Allergies/Adverse Reactions
  (ADR's) in the BCMA GUI, anything after the first line will not
  display on the GUI.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Delphi files BCMA_Main.frm and BCMA_Main.pas were modified to display
  all Allergies and ADR's.
  
 4.  HD0000000506938 -  Patient Record Flag changes from Red to Black
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Patient Record Flag changes from Red to Black if you lock your
  computer.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Delphi file MultipleDrugs.pas was modified to make sure the enable
  Patient Record flag is always displayed as Red.
  
 5.  HD0000000419658 - Special Instructions Cutting off When Using Med 
                       Overview and PRN OVerview Reports

 Patch Installation: 
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 A post install routine will run to initialize the New Kernel variable PSB 
 INJECTION SITE MAX HOURS.  This will be used for the new Injection Site 
 History functionality in BCMA.  This parameter may be changed after this
 install via the BCMA site parameters GUI client, per division, to match
 site policy.  This new parameter will be initialized for all divisions 
 that have the Parameter "PSB ONLINE" set to YES as seen in the below
 Example Install message. 
  
 A second part of the post install procedure, BCMA Injection Site Cross 
 Ref Builder, will be tasked in the background and begin running 
 immediately.  This process may take 20-30 hours to complete, depending on 
 your sites BCMA MEDICATION LOG file size, but the BCMA system can be used 
 while this background job is running.  
  
 The background job is designed to process the most recent Medical 
 Administration records and work its way back through the BCMA MEDICATION 
 LOG file until complete.  The most recent records should be available for 
 the Injection History Window, in BCMA, in the first 1 or 2 hours.  A 
 mailman message will be sent to the installer, once the background job 
 has completed.
 See an example below.
  
 The background job can be stopped gracefully, if Taskman is asked to 
 stop, and a mailman message will be sent that contains the progress of 
 the Cross Ref Builder to that point. This procedure can be restarted 
 later and it will resume where it left off.  
  
   Restart the Cross Ref Builder background job, by typing the Mumps
   command in Programmer Mode, as seen below, and press Enter:
  
      >D BEGIN^PSB3P68
  
   A mailman message will be sent to indicate the Cross Ref Builder 
   background job has resumed.
  
 The status of this background job can be checked by typing the Mumps 
 command in Programmer Mode as seen in the example status check below.
  
 The Post Install routine PSB3P68 should be deleted manually, after the 
 mailman message is received showing the Cross Ref Builder is 100% 
 complete. See Post Installation section below for instructions on how to
 delete the routine.
