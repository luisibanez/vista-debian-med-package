 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC0000000763064 - Installed BCMA Patch, one patient receiving error. 
                  Unable to open BCMA for that patient.  Broker RPC Error:
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A broker error occurs when attempting to open BCMA for a patient who
    has an Intravenous Piggyback (IVPB) medication with an unknown Action
    Status.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBVT was modified to set the variable PSBMRIEN when an unknown
    action occurs for an IVPB medication.
  
  
 2. INC00000000738057 - All Reports prompt for RM (Room) need to be
                       delaminated by a colon (:).
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The header on the BCMA Administration Times report, the BCMA Cover
    Sheet reports, Due List report, IV Bag Status report, Medication
    History Report, Medication Therapy report, Medication Variance Log
    report, Missed Medications report, PRN Effectiveness Log report, and
    Medication History report do not have a colon to delineate "Rm" from
    the room number. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOHDR was modify to include a colon (:) after the "Rm"
  
  
 3. INC00000000749807 - Inpatient Medications - Other: MisMed Report Issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA Missed Medications Report does not contain medications that
    are held or refused when run in VistA.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMM2 was modified to include held and refused medications in
    the VistA report.
  
    NOTES:
    ------
    Routine APSPFUNC called from PSBOHDR are Indian Health
    Services only routines and will display as an XINDEX error when
    installing this patch in VA Accounts.  This functionality was
    introduced by patch PSB*3.0*42. This enhancement is intended to enable
    the BCMA application to recognize whether it is operating in the Indian
    Health Service (IHS) or Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
    environment, and respond by recognizing and displaying the patient
    identifier appropriate to the environment. This will enable a single
    version of BCMA to be maintained by VHA and yet be installed and
    operate in a "plug and play" fashion in an IHS or Tribal facility
    running Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS).
