 1. INC0000000218516 - <UNDEFINED>LINE+13^PSBOML
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #857
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the BCMA Med Log report, an undefined error occurs at 
    LINE+13^PSBOML when a PHARMACY PATIENT (#55) file record does not have
    a corresponding BCMA MED LOG (#53.79) file entry.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOML was modified to correct the undefined error and send a 
    Mailman message to the mail group in the BCMA PARAMETERS GUI Unknown
    Actions field stating the following: "Order #_ given in BCMA no longer
    has a corresponding entry in the Pharmacy Patient (#55) file. Please
    submit a remedy ticket for this issue." A post install routine will
    also run letting the installer know via screen print and Mailman
    message that the BCMA PARAMETERS GUI Unknown Actions mail group has no 
    active members.
  
 2. INC0000000328464 - Error after migrating to RDPC
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When attempting to give an IV via "Unable to Scan" that contains only a
    solution and has a NAME (#.01) and DOSAGE FORM (#.02) in the PHARMACY 
    ORDERABLE ITEM (#50.7) that has a combined length of greater than 40 
    characters, it will cause users to receive the pop up dialog box
    "Incomplete data returned from VISTA".  An entry will also not be
    stored  in the ORDERABLE ITEM NAME (#15) field of the BCMA UNABLE TO
    SCAN LOG (#53.77), causing the drug not to show in the DRUG (ID #)
    field in the "BCMA Unable to Scan Detailed" report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The input transform of data dictionary was modified to allow up to 71 
    characters for the ORDERABLE ITEM NAME (#15) field in the BCMA UNABLE 
    TO SCAN LOG (#53.77).

                                 is to store the value at the the time of the
