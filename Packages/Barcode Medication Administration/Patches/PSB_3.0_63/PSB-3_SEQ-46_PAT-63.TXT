Subject: CORRECT BCMA SERVER TIME, DUE LIST ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Patch Addresses 2 issues:
  
 1. When a user logs into BCMA and their device time is exactly 
    midnight, VistA will add the value of $H to the current time to 
    get the BCMA server time.  This server time will be greater than 
    the highest allowable Fileman date, which is October 15, 2114.  
    If the BCMA Due List Report is run with the invalid default server 
    time, an infinite loop will be created, eventually causing a "Disk
    Full" error.
  
 2. A schedule with a frequency of greater than 1440 minutes 
    (24 hours) and a start date after today does not display as a Future
    Order on the BCMA Due List Report.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
   
 1. HD0000000475862 - <DSKFUL>PRINT+33^PSBODL
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user logs into BCMA and their device time is exactly 
    midnight, VistA will add the value of $H to the current time to 
    get the BCMA server time.  This server time will be greater than 
    the highest allowable Fileman date, which is October 15, 2114.  
    If the BCMA Due List Report is run with the invalid default server 
    time, an infinite loop will be created, eventually causing a "Disk
    Full" error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The error occurred because Delphi reads midnight as 0000 where Vista 
    reads midnight as 2400.  Routine PSBUTL was modified to use a time of 
    2400 for the Fileman call when a time 0000 is passed into Vista.  Also,
    routine PSBODL was modified to quit if an invalid Fileman date is 
    passed into VistA (a date before 12/31/1840 or after 10/15/2114).
  
  
 2. HD00000000352228 - QOD schedule not included in future order report
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A schedule with a Frequency of greater than 1440 minutes (24 hours), a
    start date of today, and a first scheduled administration of a future
    date will not display on the BCMA Due List report as a Future Order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBODL was modified to check if the Start Date of the order is
    greater than the Start Date of the Report, and if so, include it as a
    future order.
