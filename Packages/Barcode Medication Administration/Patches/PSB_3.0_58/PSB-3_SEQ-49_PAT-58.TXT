============

 ********************************************************************
 IMPORTANT: PATCH PSJ*5*254 MUST BE INSTALLED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE  
            INSTALLATION OF THIS PATCH.
  
 BCMA patch PSB*3*58 contains changes that will not function until patch 
 PSJ*5*254 is installed. Both patches should be installed at the same time,
 in the following sequence: PSJ*5*254, PSB*3*58.
 ********************************************************************
  
 ATTENTION: This patch includes a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
 executable file. Installation of this GUI is required immediately after 
 the KIDS install for the Patch to function.
  
 This version of BCMA was successfully tested in the field against Wireless
 Medication Administration version 4.7 at Pittsburgh and Loma Linda.
  
 For retrieval and installation instructions, please see the Client
 Installation Instructions section.
  
 The Allergy and Alerts Project addresses enhancements identified during 
 Inpatient Medications Requirements for Special Focus Group Initial 
 Request Analysis (IMR SFG IRA) Phase III/Phase IV, as well as 
 modifications requested by the Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA)
 and Inpatient Medications workgroups.  The Inpatient Pharmacy patches
 PSJ*5*253 and PSJ*5*254 are also being released as part of these
 enhancements.
  
 1. Add a flag to the order information sent to the BCMA GUI client via
    the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) broker call GET ORDER DETAIL, to
    indicate the order has Provider Override reasons and/or Pharmacist
    Interventions on the current order.
    
     a. On the BCMA Virtual Due List (VDL) tabs and Cover sheet, highlight
        the cell in the verify "Ver" column to indicate an order has 
        Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Provider override reasons
        and/or Pharmacist Interventions on the current order.
  
     b. Display the CPRS override reasons and/or Pharmacist Interventions 
        in detail on the BCMA Display Order Detail Report.
  
 2. In order to allow facilities to select a timeframe that better matches
    their site policies, the site parameter "PRN Effectiveness Entry" 
    found on the "Parameters" of the "BCMA Site Parameters" GUI has been
    expanded from 240 to 960 minutes.
  
 3. A new site parameter was added to the PARAMETERS file (#8989.5) & 
    PARAMETERS DEFINITION file (#8989.51) to allow control of how a site
    handles the administration of non-nurse verified orders.  The three
    possible choices are: Allow Administration (No Warning), Allow
    Administration with Warning, or Prohibit Administration.  Facilities
    will be able to set this option by division.  Also affects handling 
    of marking orders Held or Refused, as well as submitting Missing Dose
    requests.
  
 4. The Missed Medications report will now include a verified "Ver" column
    that will contain the initials of the nurse who verified the order, or
    three asterisks, indicating that the order was not nurse verified.  In
    addition, the Missed Medications report dialog now displays the Held,
    Refused, and Comments/Reasons checkboxes checked by default.
  
 5. Functionality was added to BCMA to test for scanning of data into the
    Quantity and Units pop-up fields. The Double Scan routine tests for the
    following criteria and rejects input that matches:
  
            o  Integer only
            o  All-numeric string (out of range for integer)
            o  IV label: nnnVnn where n is a numeric digit
            o  Number and units: nnnnnU or nnnnn U where n is a numeric
               digit. A single U is also rejected.
  
 6. A new menu option, called "Icon Legend", was added to the BCMA View 
    Menu so that when selected, a dialog will display showing icons used 
    throughout BCMA, with their corresponding descriptions, is shown.
  
 7. A new hover-over feature was added to the BCMA VDL. When CPRS Provider 
    Overrides and/or Pharmacist Interventions exist for an order, the user 
    will be able to hover over the highlighted "Ver" cell, and the
    following visual indicator will display: "Override/Intervention
    reasons."
  
 8. The Missed Medications Report dialog was modified, in BCMA, so that the
    "Include Admin Status: Held, Refused" and the "Include Detail: 
    Comments/Reasons" checkboxes will be checked (selected) as a default
    when the report dialog initially displays.
  
 9. Remedy ticket #HD208693 - Dosage form (GUM,CHEWABLE) creating pop-up
    box issue.
  
       Problem: Attempt to give an Order in BCMA, for Drug that has Dosage
                Form of "Gum, Chewable".  This causes the BCMA GUI client
                to pop up a dialogue box asking  "Enter Quantity and
                Units".
   
    Resolution: Correct Unit dose routine PSBVDLUD, to send "GUM,CHEWABLE" 
                in the dosage from string to the GUI client and this will
                stop the pop up dialogue box from occurring.
  
 10. Remedy ticket #HD420754 - BCMA Parameters GUI application is
     displaying the Division ien instead of the Station number.
  
       Problem: Upon logging on to the BCMA Parameters GUI application, a 
                message is displayed "You are currently logged on to
                Division: nnnnn".  The number, nnnnn, is currently showing
                the ien of the Division in the INSTITUTION file (#4).
  
    Resolution: The STATION NUMBER will be displayed instead of the ien.

 of items included in this patch.

 Patch Installation: 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 A post install routine will run to initialize the New Kernel variable PSB
 NON-NURSE VERIFIED PROMPT to Allow Administration No Warning.  This will
 set BCMA initially to treat these types of orders in the same manner as
 BCMA did prior to this patch.  This parameter may be changed after this
 install via the BCMA site parameters GUI client, per division, to match
 site policy.  This new parameter will be initialized for All divisions 
 that have the Parameter "PSB ONLINE" set to YES as seen in the below
 example.
