 REMEDY OVERVIEW
 ---------------
    
 1. HD0000000531302 - Given Dose Does Not Display
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2134
  
    Problem:
    --------
  
    A given dose does not display on the BCMA Medication Administration 
    History (MAH) report when another dose is given for the same 
    administration time on the wrong day.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines PSBOMH1 and PSBOMH3 to print any administrations that
    are given on the wrong day to above or below the administration times
    for that day.  Also, if administration times are modified and therefore
    an administration does not have a corresponding administration time,
    the administration will line up in chronological order starting on the
    first line.  Also, routine PSBOMH was modified to print the the ">"
    symbol in front of the administration which no longer has a
    corresponding administration time.  Routine PSBOMH2 was modified to
    print the ">" symbol in the Legend with a definition of "Scheduled
    administration times for the order have been changed".
  
 2. HD00000000532639 - BCMA MEDICAL HISTORY ISSUE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A given dose of an intravenous piggyback (IVPB) will not display on the
    BCMA MAH report if the time given is edited to a time prior to the
    original given time of the medication.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMH1 was modified to display the administration if the time
    was edited to a time prior to the original admin time.
  
 3. HD00000000533507 - MAH shows meds as not due
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The BCMA MAH displays all meds as not due until the day after
    the start date.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSBOMH was modified to check the administration times and
    display the medication as due if there are administrations due after
    the start date/time of the order.
