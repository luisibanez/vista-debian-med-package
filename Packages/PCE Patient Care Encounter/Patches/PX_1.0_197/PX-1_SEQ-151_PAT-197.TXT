Subject: KEEP CREDIT STOP VISIT FOR WORKLOAD CREDIT IF APPLICABLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will prevent the arbitrary loss of an encounter's associated 
 credit stop/secondary stop code. The credit stop/secondary stop code is 
 assigned in the clinic setup of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44). The 
 loss of the credit stop/secondary code has been evident in the station's 
 outpatient encounter file and has resulted in loss of workload credit for 
 those clinics with secondary credit stops.

   REMEDY OVERVIEW:
   ===============
   1) HD0000000386336 - Missing secondary stop code credit
    
   Problem:
   ========
   On occasion, randomly, the Credit stop code is dropped from a 
   visit/encounter while originally is included, if applicable.
  
   Technical:
   ----------
   If a clinic entry in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) is set up with 
   both the STOP CODE NUMBER field (#8) and the CREDIT STOP CODE field
   (#2503) then two entries in the VISIT file (#9000010) are created, and
   the second one is the credit stop visit. Usually those entries are
   associated with the related entries in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file
   (#409.68). Many packages subscribe to DBIA1889-B #1890 -
   $$DELVFILE^PXAPI(WHICH,VISIT,PKG,SOURCE,ASK,ECHO,USER)which is a 
   function used to delete data from the VISIT file (#9000010). If the
   indicated DBIA calls Patient Care Encounter (PCE) with passed parameter
   WHICH="ALL", all PCE entries are deleted, including the credit stop
   visit entry with its associated entry in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file
   (#409.68), with exception of any entry from files belonging to
   subscribing packages. The primary entry in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file
   (#409.68) pointing to the primary entry in the VISIT file (#9000010) is
   not deleted if this visit/encounter is associated with an entry in the
   Appointment multiple sub file(#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2). If the
   primary visit entry is left with its associated entry in the OUTPATIENT
   ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) and then this visit/encounter is updated with
   new clinical entries, the previously deleted credit stop visit is not
   recreated. The current functionality assumes that if the primary entry
   in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) exists then the credit stop
   visit with its entry in OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) would exist
   as well, if applicable. This visit/encounter, if checked out, is
   evaluated and transmitted without the expected credit stop code.
   
   Solution:
   =========
   Corrected routines PXAPIDEL and PXUTLSTP to prevent deleting the credit 
   stop visit entries with associated entries in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER 
   file (#409.68) if the primary visit is associated with the patient's
   Appointment multiple sub file (#2.98) of the PATIENT file (#2).
  
    
    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    ===========================
    This patch may be run with users on the system. However, because 
    certain PCE and Scheduling options need to be placed out of order,
    we strongly suggest it be installed after business hours when any front
    end Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications such as Computerized 
    Patient Record System (CPRS), Event Capture (EC) etc. are not in use.
  
    Install Time - Less than 5 minutes
     
    1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
        the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     
        NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
               global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
               you will need to repeat this step.
     
    2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.
     
    3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PX*1.0*197):
        a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
        c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
        d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     
    4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PX*1.0*197.
