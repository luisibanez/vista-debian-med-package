Sepsis is a vast clinical entity that takes a variety of forms. The 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,3,0)
spectrum of disorders spans from relatively mild physiologic 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,4,0)
abnormalities to septic shock. Please report the most significant level

using the criteria below:
"DATA",136.5,3,1,6,0)
 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,7,0)
1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,8,0)
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS 
"DATA",136.5,3,1,9,0)
is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical
"DATA",136.5,3,1,10,0)
insults. This syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two

"DATA",136.5,3,1,12,0)
   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C

C. difficile-associated disease occurs when the normal intestinal

flora is altered, allowing C. difficile to flourish in the intestinal
"DATA",136.5,38,1,4,0)
tract and produce a toxin that causes a watery diarrhea.  C. difficile

diarrhea is confirmed by the presence of a toxin in a stool specimen.

"KRN",19,7282,1,1,0)
This report prints utilization information for a selected date range for
"KRN",19,7282,1,2,0)
all operating rooms or for a single operating room.  The report displays
"KRN",19,7282,1,3,0)
the percent utilization, the number of cases, the total operation time
"KRN",19,7282,1,4,0)

individually and all operating rooms collectively.
"KRN",19,7282,1,6,0)
  
"KRN",19,7282,1,7,0)
The percent utilization is derived by dividing the total operation time
"KRN",19,7282,1,8,0)
for all operations (including total time patients were in OR, plus the
"KRN",19,7282,1,9,0)
cleanup time allowed for each case, plus one hour allowance for startup

and shutdown daily for each OR that had at least one case) by the total
"KRN",19,7282,1,11,0)
OR functioning time as defined in the Surgery Utilization file.  The
"KRN",19,7282,1,12,0)

have occurred within 30 days prior to any postoperative occurrences or
"KRN",19,9653,1,15,0)
within 90 days prior to death. Therefore, this report may include some
"KRN",19,9653,1,16,0)

"KRN",19,9653,1,31,0)
this report may include some operations that may or may not be risk

Definition Revised (2007):
"^DD",130,130,250,21,2,0)
Sepsis is a vast clinical entity that takes a variety of forms. The 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,3,0)
spectrum of disorders spans from relatively mild physiologic 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,4,0)
abnormalities to septic shock. Please report the most significant level
"^DD",130,130,250,21,5,0)
using the criteria below:
"^DD",130,130,250,21,6,0)
 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,7,0)
1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,8,0)
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,9,0)
is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical
"^DD",130,130,250,21,10,0)
insults. This syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,11,0)
or more of the following:
"^DD",130,130,250,21,12,0)
   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C
"^DD",130,130,250,21,13,0)
   - HR >90 bpm
"^DD",130,130,250,21,14,0)
   - RR >20 breaths/min or PaCO2 <32 mmHg(<4.3 kPa)
"^DD",130,130,250,21,15,0)
   - WBC >12,000 cell/mm3, <4000 cells/mm3, or >10% immature (band) 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,16,0)
     forms
"^DD",130,130,250,21,17,0)
   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either:
"^DD",130,130,250,21,18,0)
      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,19,0)
      greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.
"^DD",130,130,250,21,20,0)
     or
"^DD",130,130,250,21,21,0)
      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater
"^DD",130,130,250,21,22,0)
      than 12, then an anion gap acidosis is present.
"^DD",130,130,250,21,23,0)
 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,24,0)
 and one of the following:
"^DD",130,130,250,21,25,0)
   - positive blood culture
"^DD",130,130,250,21,26,0)
   - clinical documentation of purulence or positive culture from any 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,27,0)
     site thought to be causative
"^DD",130,130,250,21,28,0)
 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,29,0)
2. Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock: Sepsis is considered severe when it is 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,30,0)
associated with organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Report this 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,31,0)
variable if the patient has the clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS or 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,32,0)
sepsis AND documented organ and/or circulatory dysfunction. Examples of
"^DD",130,130,250,21,33,0)
organ dysfunction include: oliguria, acute alteration in mental status,
"^DD",130,130,250,21,34,0)
acute respiratory distress. Examples of circulatory dysfunction 
"^DD",130,130,250,21,35,0)
include: hypotension, requirement of inotropic or vasopressor agents.

confusing -- in part, because of the marked variability from patient to
"^DD",130,130,362.3,21,7,0)

"^DD",130,130,362.3,21,8,0)

"^DD",130,130,362.3,21,9,0)

Definition Revised (2004):
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,2,0)
The Mallampati classification relates tongue size to pharyngeal size.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,3,0)
This test is performed with the patient in sitting position, the head 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,4,0)
held in a neutral position, the mouth wide open, and the tongue 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,5,0)
protruding to the maximum. The subsequent classification is assigned 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,6,0)
based upon the pharyngeal structures that are visible:
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,7,0)
 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,8,0)
Class I   - visualization of the soft palate, fauces, uvula, and
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,9,0)
            anterior and posterior pillars.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,10,0)
Class II  - visualization of the soft palate, fauces, and uvula.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,11,0)
Class III - visualization of the soft palate and the base of the uvula.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,12,0)
Class IV  - soft palate is not visible at all.
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,13,0)
 
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,14,0)
The classification assigned by the clinician may vary if the patient is
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,15,0)
in the supine position (instead of sitting). If the patient phonates,
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,16,0)
this falsely improves the view. If the patient arches his or her
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,17,0)
tongue, the uvula is falsely obscured. A class I view suggests ease of
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,18,0)
intubation and correlates with a laryngoscopic view grade I 99 to 100%
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,19,0)
of the time.  Class IV view suggests a poor laryngoscopic view, grade
"^DD",130,130,901.1,21,20,0)
III or IV 100% of the time. Refer to the Operations Manual for a visual

The body's response to insult can be documented as one of two levels

with the successive level building on the previous level. You should 
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,4,0)

"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,5,0)

1. Sepsis: Sepsis is the systemic response to infection. Report this 
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,7,0)
variable if the patient has clinical signs and symptoms of SIRS. SIRS 
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,8,0)
is a widespread inflammatory response to a variety of severe clinical
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,9,0)
insults. This syndrome is clinically recognized by the presence of two 
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,10,0)
or more of the following:
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,11,0)
   - Temp >38 degrees C or <36 degrees C
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,12,0)

"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,16,0)
   - Anion gap acidosis: this is defined by either:
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,17,0)
      [Na + K] - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is 
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,18,0)
      greater than 16, then an anion gap acidosis is present.
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,19,0)
     or
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,20,0)
      Na - [Cl + HCO3 (or serum CO2)]. If this number is greater
"^DD",130,130.22,7,21,21,0)

considered as a candidate for surgery (which should be no longer than
