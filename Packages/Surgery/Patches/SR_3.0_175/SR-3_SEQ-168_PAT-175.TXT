 This patch provides the VASQIP 2011 Increment 1 to the Veterans Health
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery package in
 support of the VA Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP). The
 updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing

    relocated under the Management Reports [SRO-CHIEF REPORTS] menu.
  
 2. Remove references to "NSQIP" and "CICSP" in field labels and field 
    definitions. When the text is not in the header of a definition, the

     editable but can be viewed.
   - A new selection list for Cancellation Reasons has been added.

     updated to remove the Surgery Cancellation Reasons from the Site

    the ORGAN/SPACE SSI field (#488) in the algorithm for calculating the
    clean wound infection rates. For cardiac assessed cases, 
    ENDOCARDITIS field (#386) and MEDIASTINITIS field (#388) will be
    included in the algorithm for calculating the clean wound infection
    rates.
  
 10. The Perioperative Occurrences Report, under the Morbidity & Mortality 
     Reports [SROMM] option, will be modified to allow three selections as 
     follows:

    the date in the DATE OF OPERATION field (#.09), then this field is
    automatically updated to "Yes" when the Date of Death is saved. If the
    Date of Death is greater than 30 days from the Date of Operation then
    this field is automatically updated to "No" when the Date of Death is
    saved.
  
 2. The data dictionary of the PREOPERATIVE SLEEP APNEA field (#237.1)
    of the SURGERY file (#130) has been changed to allow for an entry of

    [SROA PREOP DATA] option. 
  
 3. Update the printed Assessment to now include the field ASSESSMENT
    COMPLETED BY field (#272.1) of the SURGERY file (#130).

    (#481) is modified from the current values of "Yes" and "No" to "None",
    "Bridge to Transplant", and "Destination Therapy"
  
 3. The existing field, WOUND CLASSIFICATION (#1.09), is added to the
    Operative Risk Summary Data (Enter/Edit) [SROA CARDIAC OPERATIVE RISK] 
    option. This field has been added to the Cardiac Print Assessment
    Report.
  
 4. The current WOUND DISRUPTION field (#404) of the Surgery file (#130)
    is added to the Outcome Information (Enter/Edit)[SROA CARDIAC-OUTCOMES]
    option. This information will appear on the Printed Assessment
    Report and added to the Cardiac Transmission.

    Functional Status, Angina, and CHF.
  
  
 IV. Transplant Module Updates:
 -------------------------------
 1. HLA Typing fields in the SURGERY TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5)
    across all four organ types are updated to allow entry of 4 digits 
    (#,#,#,#). The Transplant Transmission is also updated.
  
 2. The C-PEPTIDE AT TIME OF LISTING field (#136) of the SURGERY 
    TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5) has been changed to allow for a
    value less than 1. When the value is less than 1, it will be displayed
    with a leading zero (i.e., 0.6). 
  
 3. The POST-TX PROPHYLAXIS - TB field (#92) of the SURGERY TRANSPLANT
    ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5) has been updated to allow a value to be
    entered of "N/A". This information is added to the Transmission.
  
 4. The COLD ISCHEMIA TIME FOR ORGAN field (#87) and WARM ISCHEMIA TIME FOR
    ORGAN field (#85) of the SURGERY TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5)
