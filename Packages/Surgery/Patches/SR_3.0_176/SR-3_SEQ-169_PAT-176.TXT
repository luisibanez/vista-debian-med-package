Description:
============

 In support of the VA Surgery Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), this 
 patch provides the VASQIP Increment 2 update to the Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) Surgery package.
 The updates include the addition of new data fields, changes to existing
 fields, changes to data entry screens, changes to reports, changes to the
 Surgery Risk Assessment transmissions, and changes to transplant
 components of the VistA Surgery application.
  
  1. Surgery Cancellation Modifications
    a. Surgery cancellation functionality is modified so that any surgery 
       case that is placed on the surgery schedule and then cancelled will 
       be retained in the SURGERY file (#130) as a cancelled case
       regardless of when the case is cancelled. Also, a cancellation
       reason is required for every cancellation. Any scheduled case that
       is cancelled will be counted as a cancellation on the Report of
       Cancellations generated by the Report of Cancellations [SROCAN]
       option.
  
    b. The Report of Cancellations, generated by the Report of 
       Cancellations [SROCAN] option, is modified to group patient data 
       together within specialty so that all cases for a single patient
       will be shown together. The report will also order based on 
       operations so the same operation descriptions will show next to each
       other for the same patient.  
  
  2. Miscellaneous Additions to Risk Assessment Transmissions
    a. The name of the operating room as defined in the HOSPITAL LOCATION 
       file (#44) is added to each cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessment 
       transmission and to each 1-liner case transmission.
  
    b. The following four fields in the SURGERY file (#130) are added to
       each 1-liner case transmission and to the list of items checked for
       by the List of 1-Liner Cases Missing Information which is one of the
       reports generated by the List of Surgery Risk Assessments [SROA
       ASSESSMENT LIST] option:
        - TIME OPERATION BEGAN (#.22)
        - TIME OPERATION ENDS (#.23)
        - TIME PAT IN OR (#.205)
        - TIME PAT OUT OR (#.232)
  
  3. Positive Drug Screening
     A new POSITIVE DRUG SCREENING  field (#618) is added to the SURGERY 
     file (#130). This field is added to the Preoperative Information 
     (Enter/Edit)[SROA PREOP DATA] option, the Clinical Information 
     (Enter/Edit)[SROA CLINICAL INFORMATION] option and the Print a Surgery
     Risk Assessment [SROA PRINT ASSESSMENT] option. This field is also
     added to the cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessment transmissions and
     is added to the list of missing items functionality.
  
  4. Consolidation of Shared Cardiac, Non-Cardiac and Transplant Fields
     This patch updates various fields in the SURGERY file (#130) and in
     the SURGERY TRANSPLANT ASSESSMENTS file (#139.5) as well as various
     occurrence category descriptions in the PERIOPERATIVE OCCURRENCE
     CATEGORY file (#136.5) so that common items share common definitions.
     This patch also replaces various fields with new fields in order to
     enhance and refine certain data elements that are in common with
     cardiac and non-cardiac risk assessments and transplant assessments.
     All the associated data input options, assessment printouts and
     transmissions are updated accordingly.
     
     The complete list of updated fields, new fields and replaced 
     fields is in the patch release notes.
     
  5. Add Serial Number for Prosthesis Items
      - Two new fields, LOT NUMBER (#11) and SERIAL NUMBER (#12) are 
        added to the PROSTHESIS INSTALLED multiple field (#.47, sub-file 
        #130.01) to replace the existing LOT/SERIAL NO field (#2.5). The 
        Operation [SROMEN-OP] option and the Nurse Intraoperative Report 
        [SRONRPT] option are updated to allow editing and display of these
        two new fields.
      - LOT NUMBER field (#8) and SERIAL NUMBER field (#9) are added to
        the PROSTHESIS file (#131.9). The Update Site Configurable Files
        [SR UPDATE FILES] option is modified to allow editing of these new
        fields and to disallow editing of the LOT/SERIAL NO field (#4) and
        the STERILE CODE field (#3).
        
  6. Flash Sterilization
     Six new fields are added to the SURGERY file (#130) to document the
     number of episodes of each type of flash sterilization that happened
     for an operation:
      - FLASH-CONTAMINATION (#619)
      - FLASH-SPD/OR MGT ISSUE (#620)
      - FLASH-EMERGENCY CASE (#621)
      - FLASH-NO BETTER OPTION (#622)
      - FLASH-LOANER INSTRUMENT (#623)
      - FLASH-DECONTAMINATION (#624)
        
     The Post Operation [SROMEN-POST] option and the Nurse Intraoperative
     Report [SRONRPT] option are updated to allow editing and display of
     these two new fields.
     
  7. 30-Day Readmission
     This patch creates a transmission report that lists inpatient 
     surgery cases which were followed by the patient being readmitted 
     within 30 days of discharge. This report is run by the Surgery 
     Nightly Cleanup and Updates [SRTASK-NIGHT] option and will transmit to
     the VASQIP database automatically each quarter.
     
  8. Update ICD9 to ICD
     References to ICD9 are replaced with ICD in the following menu 
     options:
      - CPT/ICD9 Coding Menu [SRCODING MENU]
      - CPT/ICD9 Update/Verify Menu [SRCODING UPDATE/VERIFY MENU]
      - Update/verify Procedure/Diagnosis Codes [SRCODING EDIT]
     
  9. Remove Quarterly Report References
    a. References to "Quarterly Report" are removed from the Deaths Within
       30 Days of Surgery [SROQD] option.
  
    b. The routines that provided the Surgery Quarterly Report
       functionality are removed. Those routines are SROQ1, SROQ1A, SROQ2,
       SROQM, SROQM0, SROQM1 and SROQT.
  
 10. Add Superficial Incisional SSI to Cardiac Outcomes
     The SUPERFICIAL INCISIONAL SSI field (#248) in the SURGERY file 
     (#130) is added to the Outcome Information (Enter/Edit) [SROA 
     CARDIAC-OUTCOMES] option, the cardiac assessment transmission and to 
     the cardiac assessment printout.
  
 11. The following routines associated with obsolete functionality are 
     removed: SROAC, SROAC1, SROAC2, SROACCR, SROACRC, SROACS, SROASWAP,
     SROASWP, SROASWP0, SROASWP1, SROASWP2, SROAWSP3, SROASWPD, SRSLOOK,
     and SRSLOOK1.
     
 12. This patch fixes the issue reported by Remedy ticket #528445, where 
     the PREOPERATIVE IMAGES CONFIRMED field (#606) displays the same data
     as MARKED SITE CONFIRMED field (#605).
  
 13. This patch updates the CPT EXCLUSIONS file (#137) with data for 
     fiscal year 2012.
