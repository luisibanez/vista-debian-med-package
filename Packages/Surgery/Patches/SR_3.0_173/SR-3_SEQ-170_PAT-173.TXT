Subject: RECEIVING ERROR WHEN EXECUTING SRTASK-NIGHT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1.  Users are receiving an error when their system runs the nightly task
 SRTASK-NIGHT option.
 2.  A user reported that addendums created in VistA are not always being
 transmitted to CPRS. It appears that TIU BUSINESS RULES for certain
 document types or user classes are being created which can cause
 unforeseen issues.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000210945 System error running SRTASK-NIGHT 
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    Users are receiving an UNDEFINED error when executing the nightly task
    SRTASK-NIGHT option in VistA. This daily task should be run every
    night to purge outstanding requests that have not been acted upon.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SRHLXTMP to function properly if the expected global is
    not present.
  
  
 2. HD0000000286261 Info entered in surgery through VISTA is not always
                    showing on nurse intraoperative report in CPRS, 
                    especially with addendums. 
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    A user reported that addendums created in VistA are not always being 
    transmitted to CPRS. It appears that TIU BUSINESS RULES for certain
    document types or user classes are being created which can cause
    unforeseen processing issues.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Made changes to the routine SROESAD which now accesses existing
    functionality and alerts users of their inability to create
    addendums because they lack a particular USR CLASS that is associated
    with a BUSINESS RULE their site created.
