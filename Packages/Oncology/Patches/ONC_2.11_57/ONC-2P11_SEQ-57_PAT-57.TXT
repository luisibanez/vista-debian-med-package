Subject: NAACCR v13 and Blank Dates in Data Extracts

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch contains the following items:
  
 1) NAACCR 2012 v13 Updates
 This patch will include implementation of the new NAACCR 2013 (v13) guidelines.
 a) New Fields.  There are 21 new fields being added.
 b) Edited Fields.  There are 30 fields whose names are being edited.  There are
 also 4 fields which have slight changes to field length, location or coding
 instructions.
 c) Retired Field.  There is 1 field being retired.
 d) There is a new EDITs Metafile containing new edits for the new and modified
 data items listed above.
  
 2) Date Flag fields in Data Extracts 
 For Treatment Date Fields the Extracts will send either a DATE or a DATE FLAG,
 not both.  Currently, if the DATE FLAG is set to a value (10, 11 or 12) the 
 Date Extracts are sending the DATE FLAG plus the Date Field, which contains
 00000000 or 99999999.  This issue will be fixed so that if the DATE FLAG is
 set, the Data Extracts will send 8 blanks for the Date Fields rather than
 00000000 or 99999999.
  
 3) Surgical Approach field required for EDITS
 The "RX Hosp--Surg App 2010" Data Item, derived from the SURG APP 2010
 (#165.5,234) field was not being required and not being exported in the Data
 Extracts.  This item will be fixed by requiring this field for primaries
 with DATE DX > 2009 and will be included in the Data Extracts.
  
 4) New COC Follow-Up calculation
 There is a new Follow-Up calculation for CoC accredited programs.  The new
 calculation excludes Patients aged >100 and Class of Case = 00 from the 
 calculations in follow-up.
 a) Registry Summary Reports [RS] option.  When FOLLOW-UP is selected, the
 calculations will exclude patients with CLASS OF CASE = 00 or CALCULATED
 AGE >100.
   
 5) Date of First Contact field will be changed back to DATE data type
 The Date of First Contact field (#165.5,155) field was changed from a DATE
 field to a FREE TEXT field in Patch ONC*2.11*48.  This was causing problems
 with sorting reports using that field in the "PRINT CUSTOM REPORTS" [CPR]
 option.  The field will be changed back to a DATE field to allow sorting.
  
 6) First Follow-Up Date required for cases to be Complete
 For a case to be completed (Abstract Status set to COMPLETE) a Follow-Up
 must be entered.  In the Follow-Up multiple of the Oncology Patient file
 (#160,400), the Date of Last Contact or Death (#160.04,.01) field must be
 filled in for the case to go to complete.
  
 7) For Esophagus Stage grouping, the clinical stage TIS N0 M0 will be 
 automatically staged to '0' Stage Group.
  
 8) A new value was added to the list of selections for the NEOADJUVANT
 THERAPY field.  The new value is "7 - Refusal", so the field looks as follows:
 NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: ?
      Enter if NEOADJUVANT THERAPY was performed.
      Choose from: 
        0        Not recommended/NA
        1        Radiation
        2        Chemotherapy
        3        Hormone therapy
        4        Immunotherapy
        5        Combination of neoadjuvant tx
        7        Refusal   ? NEW SELECTION
        8        Recommended but not done
        9        Unknown if recommended or done
  
 9) Several fields were discontinued in FORDS 2013 for 2013 and later cases. 
 These fields are removed from the Abstract if DATE DX is after 12/31/2012,
 but still collected for cases from 2007 to 2012.  The fields are listed below:
        Ambiguous Terminology Diagnosis
        Date of Conclusive Diagnosis
        Date of Conclusive DX Flag
        Date of Multiple Tumors
        Date of Mult Tumors Flag
        Type of Multiple Tumors Reported as One Primary
        Multiplicity Counter
                       
 10) Per SEER 2012 Hematopoietic Coding Manual, for cases with DATE DX of
 2012 or after, the CLL/SLL cases have changed.  For Primary Site c77_
 and Histology Code 9823/3, the TNM Staging fields should no longer 
 default to 88, but should go to the Lymphoma Staging Schema.  The 9670/3
 Histology Code is also now obsolete, so this code will not be accepted and
 the user will receive the following warning message:
  
 HISTOLOGY (ICD-O-3): 96703  MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA, SMALL B LYMPHOCYTIC, NOS
  
 96703 is obsolete for primaries starting 2012!!!??
