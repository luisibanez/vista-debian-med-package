============

 ONC*2.11*52 Staging problems/2011 Call for Data
 
 All Data Dictionary modifications have been reviewed and approved by the Data
 Base Administrator.
  
 This patch contains the following:
 
  1) Staging problems
 
     a) 4th Edition staging of Urinary Bladder
 
     For Urinary Bladder cases with TNM values of Tis N0 M0, automatic staging 
     was calculating stage group values of "0is".  The lowercase "is" characters 
     were causing EDITS errors.
 
     Automatic staging will now generate stage group values of "0IS" for these
     cases.
 
     b) 7th Edition staging of Stomach
 
     For Stomach cases with T values of T1a or T1b or N values of N3a or N3b,
     automatic staging was calculating stage group values of 99.  This was
     incorrect and has been fixed.
 
     Also, M code selection was not working.  This has been fixed.
 
     c) Staging of Lung (all editions)
 
     For Lung cases with TNM values of TX N0 M0, automatic staging was
     calculating stage group values of "0C".  The numeric "0" character was
     causing EDITS errors.
 
     Automatic staging will now generate stage group values of "OC" (alphabetic
     "O") for these cases.
 
     d) 7th Edition staging of Colon and Rectum
 
     For Colon and Rectum cases with N values of N1a or N1b, automatic staging
     was calculating stage group values of 99 (Unknown).  This was incorrect and
     has been fixed.
 
     e) 7th Edition staging of Thyroid
 
     For Thyroid cases with T values of T1a or T1b, automatic staging was
     calculating stage group values of 99 (Unknown).  This was incorrect and
     has been fixed.
 
     f) 6th and 7th Edition staging of Prostate
 
     The PATHLOGIC T choices did not include T0 (No evidence of primary tumor)
      
     The 'HELP' text for PATHOLOGIC T did not include the following:
     TX   Primary tumor cannot be assessed
     
     These have been added.
 
     g) 7th Edition staging of Lung
 
     The following histology codes were triggering the "no staging" stuffing 
     logic for 7th Edition Lung cases:
 
     8240  CARCINOID TUMOR, NOS
     8241  ENTEROCHROMAFFIN CELL CARCINOID
     8242  ENTEROCHROMAFFIN-LIKE CELL TUMOR, MALIGNANT
     8243  GOBLET CELL CARCINOID
     8248  APUDOMA
     8950  MULLERIAN MIXED TUMOR
     8980  CARCINOSARCOMA, NOS
     8981  CARCINOSARCOMA, EMBRYONAL
 
     This was incorrect.  7th Edition Lung cases with these histologies will now
     allow TNM staging.
 
     h) 7th Edition staging of Corpus Uteri
 
     For Corpus Uteri cases with T values of T1a, T1b, T1c, T3a or T3b AND N 
     values of N1 or N2, automatic staging was calculating stage group values of
     99 (Unknown).  This was incorrect and has been fixed.
 
     i) 7th Edition staging of Lung
 
     For Lung cases with M values of M1, automatic staging was calculating stage
     group values of 99 (Unknown).  This was incorrect and has been fixed.
 
     j) 7th Edition staging of Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas
 
     For Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas the TNM choices were incorrect.
     Also, the PERIPHERAL BLOOD INVOLVEMENT codes were no longer relevant to
     7th edition staging.  The PERIPHERAL BLOOD INVOLVEMENT codes have been
     changed and the existing data converted.
 
     k) DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA (8832-8833) of SKIN (C44.)
 
     For DERMATOFIBROSARCOMA of SKIN, the TNM staging fields will be stuffed
     with the "no staging" values.
      
     The following ONCOLOGY PRIMARY file (#165.5) fields will be stuffed:
 
     CLINICAL T                  (#37.1)
     CLINICAL N                  (#37.2)
     CLINICAL M                  (#37.3)
     STAGE GROUP CLINICAL        (#38) 
     STAGED BY (CLINICAL STAGE)  (#19) 
     MULTIMODALITY THERAPY       (#69.4)
     PATHOLOGIC T                (#85)
     PATHOLOGIC N                (#86)
     PATHOLOGIC M                (#87)
     STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC      (#88) 
     STAGED BY (PATHOLOGIC STAGE)(#89)  
 
  2) [QA Print Abstract QA (80c)]
 
     DATE OF FIRST CONTACT (165.5,155) has been added to the [QA Print Abstract
     QA (80c)] option.  DATE OF FIRST CONTACT immediately precedes DATE DX.
   
  3) [STA *..Statistical Reports ...]
      [SP Survival by Site]
      [SS Survival by Stage]
      [TX Survival by Treatment]
     
     When using the above "Statistical Reports" options, the registrar would be
     asked to make the following choice:
 
     STATUS expression: STATUS="Dead"
      1   STATUS  
      2   STATUS/LAST TUMOR STATUS  
     CHOOSE 1-2: 
 
     The STATUS/LAST TUMOR STATUS choice is invalid and has been removed.
 
  4) [MA Print QA/Multiple Abstracts]
 
     The [5 Print PCE] option has been removed from the [MA Print QA/Multiple
     Abstracts] menu.
 
   5) [FR Individual Follow-up Report]
     
     The following option has been placed "Out of Order".  If no interest is
     expressed in retaining it, it will be deleted in a future patch.
 
     In the [FOL *..Follow-up Functions ...] menu:
       In the [FP Follow-up Procedures Menu ...] sub-menu
 
     FR     Individual Follow-up Report
              **> Out of order:  Marked for deletion
     
  6) [DI Disease Index]
 
     Disease Index Casefinding was capturing inappropriate POV codes (e.g. V01.5
     RABIES CONTACT).  This has been fixed.
 
  7) [*..Casefinding/Suspense ...]
       [Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search]
 
     PTF casefinding has been enhanced to include the following ICD-9 codes:
 
     795.16  PAP SMR VAG-CYTOL MALIG
     796.76  PAP SMR ANUS-CYTOL MALIG
     V12.41  PERS HX BENIGN NEOPL OF BRAIN
 
  8) [TIME Timeliness Report]
 
     a) The Timeliness Report was including cases which had never been
        'Complete' in its "Pct of 'Completed' cases compliant" calculation.
        This was incorrect.  These cases will now be excluded from the
        percentage calculation.
      
     b) The Timeliness Report has been enhanced to provide the registrar with
        the option of printing a list of non-compliant cases.  The registrar
        will now be asked the following question:
 
        Do you want to print a list of non-compliant cases? YES//
 
        If the registrar answers YES, the TIMELINESS NON-COMPLIANCE REPORT will
        print after the Timeliness Report.
 
  9) [NC Print Abstract NOT Complete List]
     ABSTRACT STATUS (165.5,91) = A (Accession only)    
 
     The ABSTRACT STATUS of A (Accession only) has been added to the [NC Print
     Abstract NOT Complete List] option output.
  
 10) [CT Create ACOS Data Download]
     DATE CASE LAST CHANGED (165.5,198)
 
     The [CT Create ACOS Data Download] option has been modified to prompt for
     "Diagnosis Year" rather than "Accession Year".
 
     Also, in order to correctly utilize the "Cases within a 'Date Case Last
     Changed' date range" option, DATE CASE LAST CHANGED will now be updated
     with the current date when a follow-up is entered or modified.  This update
     will affect all of a patient's 'Complete' cases.
 
     To insure that all 'Complete' cases have a DATE CASE LAST CHANGED value,
     the post-install program will compute a DATE CASE LAST CHANGED value for
     those 'Complete" cases which do not have one.
 
 11) VACCR data item "Station Number" [2541-2546]
 
     The VACCR extraction logic for data item "Station Number" has been changed.
     The "Station Number" value will now be padded with leading zeros.
     e.g. 000578
  
 12) Name--Alias [3466-3505]
 
     The NAACCR data item "Name--Alias" will have any punctuation characters
     in the data replaced with <BLANKS> in the extract record.  This change
     will only affect the extract value and will not modify the stored value.
 
 13) Addr Current--City        [2131-2180]
     Addr Current--No & Street [3748-3807]
 
     If the patient's current city and/or street address was blank in the
     patient's PATIENT file record, the following EDITS errors would be
     generated:
  
     E:Addr Current--City cannot be blank if Date of Diagnosis is greater than
       1995 
     E:Addr Current--No & Street cannot be blank if Date of Diagnosis is greater
       than 1995 
 
     The extract logic will now insert the value "UNKNOWN" into the following
     NAACCR data items if blank in the PATIENT file:
     Addr Current--City
     Addr Current--No & Street
 
 14) New CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS (164.18) entry
 
     The following drug has been added to the CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS file:
 
     GENERIC NAME: BENDAMUSTINE
     NSC NUMBER: 065628
     BRAND NAME/ABBREVIATION: TREANDA
     BRAND NAME/ABBREVIATION: RIBOMUSTIN
     BRAND NAME/ABBREVIATION: SDX-105
 
 15) CAUSE OF DEATH (160,19)
 
     CAUSE OF DEATH is coded by central registries.  For this reason it has been
     removed from the "Death Information" dialog of the follow-up dialog. The
     data item STATE DEATH CERT (165.5,19.1) has been retained. 
 
 16) TNM CLIN DESCRIPTOR (165.5,241)
     TNM PATH DESCRIPTOR (165.5,242)
 
     Lymphoma cases require that STAGE GROUP CLINICAL and STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC
     values be entered manually.  To accommodate the E (Extranodal) and S
     (Spleen) modifiers, some stage group values were embedded with the "E" and
     "S" suffixes (e. g. IIIE).  This inclusion of the modifier with the stage
     group value was causing the following EDITS error.
 
     TNM Clin Stage Group (COC)
     E:3ES is not a valid value for TNM Clin Stage Group 
         TNM Clin Stage Group (970)          = 3E 
 
     To fix this problem the following changes have been made:
 
     1) Two new data items, TNM CLIN DESCRIPTOR and TNM PATH DESCRIPTOR, have
        been added.  These data items will have the following values and will
        only be prompted for lymphoma cases:
 
        1        E (Extranodal)
        2        S (Spleen)
        5        E & S (Extranodal and spleen)
 
      2) The following choices have been removed for STAGE GROUP CLINICAL and
         STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC:
 
         2E      IIE
         3E      IIIE
         3ES     IIIE+S
         3S      IIIS
 
 17) Inter-field edit check WARNING
 
     The following inter-field edit check WARNING which compares OTHER CANCER
     against SEQUENCE NUMBER has been modified.  The checks for SEQUENCE NUMBER
     values of 60 have been removed.
 
     Old WARNING:
     WARNING: OTHER CANCER = Yes
           SEQUENCE NUMBER cannot not be 00 or 60
 
     New WARNING:
     WARNING: OTHER CANCER = Yes
           SEQUENCE NUMBER cannot not be 00
 
 18) [EX Print Abstract-Extended (80c)]
     CLASS OF CASE (165.5,.04) display
 
     CLASS OF CASE was not displaying correctly on the [EX Print
     Abstract-Extended (80c)] report.  This is has been fixed.
 
 19) NCDB EXTRACT v12
 
     The following data items have been added to the NCDB EXTRACT v12 format:
 
     NPI-Primary Surgeon      [2340-2349] 
     NPI-Radiation Oncologist [2350-2359] 
     NPI-Medical Oncologist   [2360-2369]
