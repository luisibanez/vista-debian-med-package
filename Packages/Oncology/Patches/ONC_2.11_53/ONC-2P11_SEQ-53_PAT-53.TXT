Description:
============

 Patch ONC*2.11*53 (CStage 0203/NAACCR v12.1)
 
 All Data Dictionary modifications have been reviewed and approved by the Data
 Base Administrator.
  
 This patch contains the following:
 
  1) Collaborative Stage version 0203
 
     This patch implements CS version 0203.  The necessary data conversions will
     be performed when the patch is installed.
 
     This patch also identifies cases for which CS 0203 review/recoding is
     required or recommended.  To facilitate this process a new data item, CS
     REVIEW REQUIRED (#165.5,247), has been added.  If, during the CS 0203
     conversion process, a case satisfies the "review/recode" criteria, CS
     REVIEW REQUIRED will be set to 1 (Needs review).  The registrar may then
     create a list of cases requiring review/recoding via the [CPR Print Custom
     Reports] or [DS Define Search Criteria] options by sorting or searching for
     CS REVIEW REQUIRED values of "Needs review".  Upon reviewing the case,
     the registrar can change CS REVIEW REQUIRED to 0 (Reviewed) thereby 
     removing the case from any future review/recode lists.
 
     NOTE: The following CS conversions were inadvertently left out of patch
           ONC*2.11*51 and have be included in patch ONC*2.11*53.
 
           For Lymphoma schema:
           TUMOR SIZE (CS) (#165.5,29.2) values of 888 have been to converted to
           988.
 
           For Prostate schema:
           SSF1 (#165.5,44.1) values of 990 have been to converted to 980.
 
  2) NAACCR (North American Association of Central Cancer Registries) v12.1
 
     This patch implements NAACCR Record Layout v12.1.  The following changes
     have been included in this patch:
 
     MARITAL STATUS AT DX (#165.5,11)
     New code 6 (Unmarried or Domestic Partner)
 
     MULTIPLICITY COUNTER (#165.5,196)
     New code 00 (No primary tumor identified)
     New code 89 (Multicentric, multifocal, number unknown)
 
  3) [CF Automatic Casefinding-Lab Search]
     [PT Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search]
 
     Lab casefinding has been enhanced to include the following:
 
     Squamous cell neoplasms (805-808) of the skin
     Basal cell neoplasms (809)
 
     PTF casefinding has been enhanced to include the following ICD-9 codes:
 
     228.02 HEMANGIOMA INTRACRANIAL
     288.4  HEMOPHAGOCYTIC SYNDROMES
     289.6  FAMILIAL POLYCYTHEMIA
 
  4) [PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)]
     APPROACH (#165.5,234)
 
     The label for data item APPROACH was incorrectly listed as "Surg App 2010"
     on the [PA Print Complete Abstract (132c)] report.  This has been fixed.
     It is now labeled as "Approach".
 
  5) APUDOMA (8248/1) of the LUNG
 
     In patch ONC*2.11*52 APUDOMA was removed from the "no staging" list for
     LUNG cases.  Since APUDOMA exists only with a Behavior Code of "/1"
     (Neoplasms of uncertain and unknown behavior) it has been returned to the
     LUNG "no staging" list.
  
  6) 7th Edition Melanoma of the Skin
 
     In the 6th Edition of AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging,
     the following histologies were "no longer appropriate for or relevant to
     the staging of melanoma".  For this reason they were added to the "no
     staging" list.
 
     8723/3 MALIGNANT MELANOMA, REGRESSING
     8728/3 MENINGEAL MELANOMATOSIS
     8730/3 AMELANOTIC MELANOMA
     8740/3 MALIGNANT MELANOMA IN JUNCTIONAL NEVUS
     8741/2 PRECANCEROUS MELANOSIS, NOS
     8741/3 MALIGNANT MELANOMA IN PRECANCEROUS MELANOSIS
     8742/2 LENTIGO MALIGNA
     8746/3 MUCOSAL LENTIGINOUS MELANOMA
     8770/3 MIXED EPITHELIOID AND SPINDLE CELL MELANOMA
     8773/3 SPINDLE CELL MELANOMA, TYPE A
     8774/3 SPINDLE CELL MELANOMA, TYPE B
 
     With the implementation of the 7th Edition these histologies are now
     stageable.
 
     They will remain on the "no staging" list for 6th Edition cases.
 
  7) Addr Current--No & Street [3748-3807]
 
     The PATIENT (#2) file field STREET ADDRESS [LINE 1] (#2,.111) is the source
     for the NAACCR data item "Addr Current--No & Street".  If STREET ADDRESS
     [LINE 1] contained an "@" character, the following EDITS error would occur:
 
     E:Addr Current--No & Street is not valid   
 
     To resolve this problem the "@" character has been added to the list of
     characters that will be stripped from address data prior to inclusion in
     the NAACCR extract record.
 
  8) FORDS (Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards) 2011
 
     In accordance with FORDS 2011 the following Site-Specific Surgery Codes
     have been modified or added:
 
     LIVER AND INTRAHEPATIC BILE DUCTS C22.0 C22.1
     Re-worded description of code 66: 
       Excision of an intrahepatic bile duct PLUS partial hepatectomy
 
     Re-worded description of code 75:
       Extrahepatic bile duct and hepatectomy WITH transplant
 
     BREAST C50.0 C50.9
     Added new code 76: 
       Bilateral mastectomy for single tumor involving both breasts
 
     PROSTATE C61.9
     Clarified code 19: 
       Transurethral resection (TURP) NOS, no specimen sent to path
 
     Clarified code 21:
       Transurethral resection (TURP) NOS, specimen sent to path
 
  9) DATE OF MULTIPLE TUMORS (#165.5,195)
 
     If MULT TUM RPT AS ONE PRIM (#165.5,194) was coded as 99 (Unknown), DATE OF
     MULTIPLE TUMORS was being stuffed with 99/99/9999.  This was incorrect.
     It should be stuffed with the DATE DX (#165.5,3) value.  This has been
     fixed.
 
 10) ELAPSED MONTHS TO COMPLETION (#165.5,157.1)
 
     ELAPSED MONTHS TO COMPLETION was not being calculated correctly for all
     cases.  The current calculation will utilize only the "month" portions of
     DATE OF FIRST CONTACT (#165.5,155) and DATE CASE COMPLETED (#165.5,90) and
     disregard the "day" portions.
 
 11) [CT Create ACOS Data Download]
 
     If a DATE DX (#165.5,3) value was inexact (e.g. "2010"), the [CT Create
     ACOS Data Download] option would include it in the previous year's download
     data. 
 
     For example, if the "Diagnosis Year" selected was "2009" and a 2010 case
     had an inexact DATE DX of "2010", the 2010 case was being included in the
     2009 download.
 
     This has been fixed.
  
 12) Neuroendocrine Tumors
 
     7th Edition Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Colon (C18.0, C18.2-C18.9) were
     being stuffed with the "no staging" values.  This was incorrect and has
     been fixed.  7th Edition Neuroendocrine Tumors are stageable.
 
 13) [NC Print Abstract NOT Complete List]
 
     The "PRIMARY ABSTRACT NOT-COMPLETE Report" can be sorted by either DATE DX
     or DATE OF FIRST CONTACT.  If the "sorted by" field was null (blank), the
     null entry would not appear on the report.
 
     For example, if a "not complete" case did not have a DATE OF FIRST CONTACT
     and DATE OF FIRST CONTACT was selected as the "sorted by" field, this case
     would not appear on the NOT-COMPLETE Report.
 
     This has been fixed.
 
 14) INITIATED BY (#165.5,244)
 
     A new data item, INITIATED BY, has been added to the abstract.  INITIATED
     BY will be stuffed with the user's name when a new abstract is created.
     INITIATED BY can be viewed in "Case Administration" section of the
     abstract.
 
 15) STATE DEATH CERT (#160,19.1)
     NAACCR item "Cause of Death" [1910] 2269-2272
 
     STATE DEATH CERT was originally created to accommodate the non-standard
     CAUSE OF DEATH codes 7777 and 7797.  With the removal of CAUSE OF DEATH in
     patch ONC*2.11*52, it is no longer necessary to prompt for STATE DEATH
     CERT.  It has therefore been removed from the "Death Information" section
     of the follow-up dialog.
 
     The NAACCR item "Cause of Death" [1910] 2269-2272 will now be computed
     from the VITAL STATUS (#160.04,1) value.
 
     If VITAL STATUS = 1 (Alive)
       "Cause of Death" = "0000" (Patient alive at last contact)
 
     If VITAL STATUS = 0 (Dead)
       "Cause of Death" = "7777" (State death certificate not available)
    
 16) NEOADJUVANT THERAPY (#165.5,245)
 
     A new data item, NEOADJUVANT THERAPY, has been added to the abstract.
     NEOADJUVANT THERAPY has been placed as the last item in "First Course of
     Treatment" surgery dialog.  It has the following values:
 
     NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: ??
          
         Neoadjuvant therapy is the administration of therapeutic agents before 
         the main treatment.
    
      Choose from: 
        0        Not recommended/NA
        1        Radiation
        2        Chemotherapy
        3        Hormone therapy
        4        Immunotherapy
        5        Combination of neoadjuvant tx
        8        Recommended but not done
        9        Unknown if recommended or done
 
 17) 7th Edition MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA (8247)
 
     a) The 7th Edition Cancer Staging Manual was the first edition to contain a
        chapter specific to MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA.  The 7th Edition MERKEL CELL
        CARCINOMA criteria were being used for all previous editions.  This has
        been fixed.  The 7th Edition criteria now apply only to 2010+ cases.
 
     b) 7th Edition Merkel cell carcinoma of the eyelid (C44.1) was being staged
        with the MERKEL CELL CARCINOMA criteria.  This was incorrect.  Merkel
        Cell of the eyelid should be staged as CARCINOMA OF THE EYELID.  This
        has been fixed.
 
     c) When computing STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC (#165.5,88), the algorithms for 
        computing Stage Groups IB and IIB were not correct.  This has been fixed
        with the following staging logic:
 
        If T1 pNX cN0 M0, STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC = IB 
        If T2 pNX cN0 M0, STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC = IIB 
        If T3 pNX cN0 M0, STAGE GROUP PATHOLOGIC = IIB 
 
 18) MULTIPLE TUMORS (#165.5,69)
     MULTIPLICITY COUNTER (#165.5,196)
 
     2007+ cases were being prompted for both MULTIPLE TUMORS and MULTIPLICITY
     COUNTER.  This was redundant.  Pre-2007 cases will now be prompted for
     MULTIPLE TUMORS and 2007+ cases will be prompted for MULTIPLICITY COUNTER.
 
 19) [Oncology Site Manager Menu]
     [RI Reindex Data Files (160,165.5,165)]
 
     The [RI Reindex Data Files (160,165.5,165)] option no longer functions
     properly and has been deleted.
 
 20) [EA Edit Site/AccSeq# Data]
     Remedy Ticket # 463070 - <UNDEFINED>PRIM+1^ONCOUTC *ONCOD
 
     If, when using the [EA Edit Site/AccSeq# Data] option, the registrar
     answered "No" to the "Data OK?" prompt, the program would abort with the
     following error:
 
     <UNDEFINED>PRIM+1^ONCOUTC *ONCOD0
  
     This has been fixed and resolves Remedy Ticket # 463070.
 
 21) [TNM Compute percentage of TNM forms completed]
 
     The [TNM Compute percentage of TNM forms completed] option was utilizing a
     DATE DX date range to compute the TNM form completion percentage.  This was
     incorrect.  It will now utilize a DATE OF FIRST CONTACT date range.
 
 22) ABSTRACTED BY (#165.5,92)
 
     ABSTRACTED BY is stuffed with the registrar's name when a case is
     'Completed' for the first time.  It is never deleted or subsequently
     re-stuffed.  Some older 'Complete' cases have no ABSTRACTED BY values.  For
     these cases there is no way for the registrar to fill in ABSTRACTED BY.
 
     Now, if ABSTRACTED BY is missing for a 'Complete' case, re-'Completing" the
     case will stuff the registrar's name into ABSTRACTED BY.
 
 23) Inter-field edit check WARNING
 
     The inter-field edit check which compares OTHER CANCER against SEQUENCE
     NUMBER has been modified.
 
     Old WARNING:
     WARNING: OTHER CANCER = No
           SEQUENCE NUMBER must be 00
 
     New WARNING:
     WARNING: OTHER CANCER = No
           SEQUENCE NUMBER must be 00 or 60
 
     Also, if OTHER CANCER = "Yes", this edit is now bypassed.
 
 24) SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) (#165.5,138.4)
     SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC (F) (#165.5,138.5)
     "No Treatment" Stuffing
 
     The SCOPE OF LN SURGERY (F) and SCOPE OF LN SURGERY @FAC (F) "No Treatment"
     stuffing logic for the following primary sites was stuffing a value of 0
     (None).  This was incorrect.  It should stuff a value of 9 (Unknown/NA).
     This has been fixed.
  
     C75.1 PITUITARY
     C75.2 CRANIOPHARYNGEAL DUCT
     C75.3 PINEAL GLAND
 
 25) Incorrectly formatted request error
 
     The following EDITS error is usually caused by the existence of non-
     standard characters within one of the OncoTrax TEXT fields:
 
     -2  Client: Incorrectly formatted request error
 
     Unfortunately, the error message does not specify which of the 14 TEXT
     fields contains the non-standard character(s).
 
     To assist the registrar in locating the problem TEXT field, a new option
     has been added to the Utility Menu:
 
     TEXT Find non-standard characters in TEXT
 
     This is how it works:
 
     Select *..Utility Options Option:  Find non-standard characters in TEXT
     Select primary or patient name: TEST,A
 
     TEXT-REMARKS
     TEXT line: BCG (bacille Calmette-Guirin)
     Non-standard character: i
 
 26) [DF Print Due Follow-up List by Month Due]
     [LF Print Delinquent (LTF) List]
 
     The [DF Print Due Follow-up List by Month Due] and [LF Print Delinquent
     (LTF) List] options have been modified.  Each option now has 2 report
     formats: "Standard format" and "Remote employees format".  Upon selecting
     either of these options the registrar will be prompted to select the
     desired format.
 
 Select *..Follow-up Functions Option: DF Print Due Follow-up List by Month Due
 
  Select report format: ?
 
 Select the report format you wish to use for this report.
 
      Select one of the following:
 
           1         Standard format
           2         Remote employees format
 
     The "Standard format" displays:
      Full patient name
      PID#
      Date of Last Contact or Death
      Site/GP
      Date DX
 
 Example of "Standard format":
  Name                  Pid#   Follow-up   Site/Gp                    Date Dx

 27) 7th Edition staging of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Other 
     Cutaneous Carcinomas
 
     For Cutaneous Carcinoma cases with N values of N2a, N2b or N2c, automatic
     staging was calculating stage group values of 99 (Unknown).  This was
     incorrect and has been fixed.
 
 28) NAACCR item TNM Clin Descriptor [974-974]
 
     Some older cases may be extracting a TNM Clin Descriptor value of 4 (Y
     (Classification during or after initial multimodality therapy)).
     Code 4 is only appropriate as a TNM Path Descriptor.  This has been fixed.
 
 29) FEE BASIS (#165.5,237)
 
     The DESCRIPTION of FEE BASIS has been modified.  The references to "work
     up" and "services not provided at the medical center" have been removed.
 
     Old DESCRIPTION:  
     Indicates if the patient was referred to another facility for work up,
     treatment or services not provided at the medical center or to a
     facility closer to the patient's residence either on a "Fee Basis" or
     via a CONTRACT with the reporting facility.
 
     New DESCRIPTION:  
     Indicates if the patient was referred to another facility for
     treatment or to a facility closer to the patient's residence
     either on a "Fee Basis" or via a CONTRACT with the reporting
     facility.
 
 30) Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) of Stomach
     Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) of Stomach
     CS SCHEMA DISCRIMINATOR (#165.5,240)
 
     GIST and NET stomach cases were being prompted for CS SCHEMA DISCRIMINATOR.
     This was incorrect and has been fixed.
 
 31) AFIP SUBMISSION (#165.5,83)
 
     The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) will disestablish by
     September 2011.  Effective April 1, 2011, all consultation cases must be
     sent to the Joint Pathology Center (JPC).
 
     In accordance with this change the LABEL for data item AFIP SUBMISSION has
     been changed to AFIP/JPC SUBMISSION.
 
 32) COC ACCREDITATION (#160.1,68)
  
     A new data item, COC ACCREDITATION, has been added to the ONCOLOGY SITE
     PARAMETERS (#160.1) file.  This data item will identify the registry as
     being associated with a CoC (Commission on Cancer) accredited cancer 
     program.
 
     This data item has been added to the VACCR (VA Central Cancer Registry)
     extract at column position [2547-2548].
 
 33) CLASS OF CASE 30
     SURG DX/STAGING PROC @FAC (#165.5,58.4)
 
     If CLASS OF CASE = 30 (Dx and all tx elsewhere AND reporting facility
     participated in dx), SURG DX/STAGING PROC @FAC was being stuffed with "00"
     (No surgical diagnostic or staging procedure).  This was incorrect.
     For CLASS OF CASE = 30 cases, surgical diagnostic and staging procedures
     are valid.  This has been fixed.  
 
 34) [RA Automatic Casefinding-Radiology Search]
     [PT Automatic Casefinding-PTF Search]
     Remedy Ticket # 496331 - Case Finding Issue
 
     Casefinding requires an ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS (#160.1) entry whose 
     DIVISION (#200,16) value matches the user's login DIVISION.  If the user
     logged in to a DIVISION for which there was no ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETERS
     entry, the program would abort with the following error:
 
     <SUBSCRIPT>T+3^ONCOCFR ^ONCO(160.1,"")
 
     This has been fixed.  In the event that the user now attempts to run
     OncoTrax casefinding from a DIVISION for which there is no matching
     ONCOLOGY SITE PARAMETER entry, a message will be displayed and the program
     will return to the [SUS *..Casefinding/Suspense ...] menu.
 
 35) NOTE TITLE (#165.5,248)
     NOTE DATE (#165.5,249)
 
     Two new data items, NOTE TITLE and NOTE DATE, have been added to the
     abstract.  NOTE TITLE and NOTE DATE record the name and date of the note
     which documents staging in the medical record.  They appear after PHYSICIAN
     STAGING (#165.5,66) in the "Stage of Disease at Diagnosis" section of the
     abstract.
 
 36) SITE-GROUP FOR ONCOLOGY (#164.2)
     LEUKEMIA, ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, ACUTE NONLYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, CHRONIC MYELOCYTIC
     HEMATO/RETICULO, OTHER
 
     a) The following SITE-GROUP OF ONCOLOGY entries were being blocked from
     selection when creating a new primary.  This block has been removed.
 
     LEUKEMIA, ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, ACUTE NONLYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC
     LEUKEMIA, CHRONIC MYELOCYTIC
 
     b) The entry HEMATO/RETICULO, OTHER has been added to the SITE-GROUP FOR
     ONCOLOGY file.
 
     The following topographies have been associated with it:
     C42.0  BLOOD
     C42.1  BONE MARROW
     C42.2  SPLEEN
     C42.3  RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM NOS
     C42.4  HEMATOPOIETIC SYSTEM NOS
 
 37) [LF Print Delinquent (LTF) List]
 
     The DELINQUENT (LTF) report has been modified to exclude patients whose
     primaries are all non-analytic.  If a patient has at least one analytic
     primary, they will be included in the DELINQUENT (LTF) report.
