 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000777165 - Direct access to field 3 of file 80 in Emergency
                       Pathogens (EPI) application needs to be replaced
    
     Problem:
     --------
     Form LREPI9 uses a direct read of the Diagnosis field (#3) from the
     ICD Diagnosis file (#80) to extract the diagnosis code description. 
     This field will be going away with the release of ICD10 code (patches
     ICD*18.0*57 and LEX*2.0*80).
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify form LREPI9 to use API $$ICDDX^ICDCODE to extract the diagnosis
     code description from file (#80) rather than using a direct read of
     field (#3). The API obtains the diagnosis code description from the
     Diagnosis - Versioned field (#1) of subfile Diagnosis - Versioned
     (#80.067) of ICD Diagnosis file (#80). This field is unaffected by the
     release of the ICD and LEX patches.
  
     Form:    LREPI9
