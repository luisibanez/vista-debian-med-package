 This patch addresses the following items related to Laboratory Data 
 Sharing and Interoperability (LEDI) IV:
  
 o LEDI IV added the performing laboratory to the Anatomic Pathology (AP)
   reports. However, for sites that have e-signature turned on, the 
   performing laboratory was displaying before the pathologist's signature.
   It was reported that with it before, the signature gets lost and is
   difficult to find, and having it after the signature would make for a
   nicer presentation of the report. This patch changes it so that the
   performing laboratory is displayed after the signature.
  
 o LEDI IV made the NAME field (#.01) in the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61),
   COLLECTION SAMPLE file (#62), and ETIOLOGY FIELD file (#61.2) 
   uneditable. This patch will restore the original functionality to make
   it editable again.
  
 o An issue was found where if a user ran option 'Multipurpose
   accessioning' [LRQUICK] after logging in an AP accession via option
   'Log-in, anat path' [LRAPLG], that an accession number was not being
   assigned to the order. Additionally, the system was not displaying the
   usual prompts to the user. This issue has been fixed with this patch.
  
 o When patch LR*5.2*415 was nationally released, a new bug was introduced.
   During the check to make sure that an accession number was not already
   in use, the software is incorrectly referencing the LRAAX variable when
   it should have referenced the LRAA0 variable instead.  This issue will
   be corrected by this patch.
  
 o If when loading the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical 
   Terminology (SNOMED CT) mappings via option Load SNOMED SCT Mapping
   [LA7S LOAD MAPPING SCT], an alert was sent to Standards & Terminology
   Services (STS) for an entry that had an exception with the mapping, then
   during subsequent loads - the system is not sending an alert again for
   this entry (if an exception was found with the new mapping) - EVEN if
   the SNOMED CT ID changed with the new mapping. This patch fixes the 
   code to send an alert to STS for subsequent SNOMED CT ID changes for an 
   entry if an exception was found with the new mapping.
  
 o This patch updates the description for option AP LEDI Data Entry [LRAP 
   VR].
  
 o The Joint Pathology Center (JPC) has replaced the Armed Forces Institute
   of Pathology (AFIP). This patch replaces any references to the AFIP with
   JPC.
      
 o This patch fixes a bug that was preventing certain Microbiology fields
   from being assigned a performing laboratory during results entry.
  
 o When entering results using the Results entry [LRMIEDZ] option at the 
   designate performing laboratory prompt, if the user chooses specific 
   sections of report, certain fields are incorrectly displayed with a
   number sign (#) and a number.  This patch will remove the erroneous
   display and present the fields without any additional '#xx' reference.
    
 o Option Results entry (batch) [LRMISTUF] is prompting for a performing 
   laboratory even when the 'Ask Performing Lab Micro' parameter is set to 
   'No'. This patch fixes the code to not prompt for a performing
   laboratory if the parameter is set to 'No' during batch entry, but will
   automatically assign one based on the user's defaults.
   
 o If during results entry, the user sends an alert for an accession that
   has add-on tests, when the alert is processed, it is displaying the last
   test added to the accession on the report header - even if that was not
   the test the alert was sent for. This patch fixes the code so that the
   correct test is displayed on the header.
  
 o When entering comments for Microbiology organisms during results entry, 
   if the comments are longer than 49 characters, it can run from one line
   to the next and break right in the middle of a word when the results are
   later viewed.  This patch will update the report so that the words will 
   wrap correctly from one line to the next for a better visual display of 
   the results.
  
 o On the Cumulative report, if there is a performing laboratory assigned
   to a microbiology report, a separating line (containing "=--=--=--=") is
   printed between the main report and the performing laboratory
   assignment. However, when looking at the report, it is possible to
   mistake the "=--=--=--=" line as a separator between different
   microbiology reports, when in fact it is separating between different
   sections of the same report. This patch will add a line containing equal
   signs ("==========") after each microbiology report on the Cumulative,
   so that it is clearer where one microbiology report ends and another
   begins.
     
 o When editing an AP accession via option Edit log-in & clinical hx, anat
   path [LRAPED], if the user goes to add a new specimen multiple, the
   defaults for specimen topography and collection sample are not
   displaying.  This patch fixes the code so the defaults display when
   editing an AP accession via Edit log-in & clinical hx, anat path
   [LRAPED] option.
  
 o If a referral laboratory has e-signature turned on for AP reports and
   releases an AP supplementary report, the report is not being sent back
   to the collecting site. This issue has been fixed with this patch.
  
 o When the 'Delete accession #, anat path [LRAPKILL]' option is executed, 
   the reference to the accession is not deleted out of the LAB 
   ORDER ENTRY file (#69).  This patch fixes the code so that the reference 
   is also deleted. It will also update the status of the order to canceled.
  
 o A prompt for cytology workload profile is added when logging in a 
   cytology referral accession at a host site.
  
 o When a collecting site accepts a LEDI micro result that only contains 
   preliminary comments and they preview the result before accepting it,
   the report is not displaying those comments. This issue will be fixed
   with this patch.

    Modified routine LRRMM to print a form-feed before printing a micro 
    report.
  
    Routine: LRRMM
  
 5. INC000000812261 - Microbiology: Mycology Screening issue post LEDI IV
  
    Problem
    -------
    When entering microbiology results, the system allows the selection of 
    any organism and is not screening out non-fungal organisms as it
    should.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified the Data Dictionary (file #63, subfile #63.37, field #.01) to 
    put back the screen that existed pre-LEDI IV to screen out non-fungal 
    organisms.
  
 6. INC000000816057 - Issue with cumulative report if field Test Field 
                      Length is null
    Duplicates:
    INC000000810685 - Lab - LEDI:
    INC000000812936 - Lab - LEDI:
  
    Problem
    -------
    If the field TEST FIELD LENGTH (#1) in the LAB REPORTS file (#64.5) is 
    null, it can cause a looping in CPRS when a user selects a cumulative 
    report that has a test with a missing field length. It will also fill
    up a scratch global on the VistA system and affect system availability.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified routines LR7OSUM3 and LR7OSUM5 to use a default value of 15 if
    the Test Field Length is null.
  
    Routines: LR7OSUM3 and LR7OSUM5
   
 7. INC000000812762 - Microbiology: Error when verifying data
    Duplicate:
    INC000000828286 - MIN- Lab: LEDI IV Vitek Interface error
  
    Problem
    -------
    Routine LRMIUT1 is using variable Y when setting the AR 
    cross-reference. When that variable is not set, it causes an error to 
    occur.
  
    Solution
    -------- 
    Modified routine LRMIUT1 to use the variable DT when setting the AR 
    cross-reference.
  
    Routine: LRMIUT1
  
 8. INC000000816895 - Lab - Anatomic Path - LEDI IV Print Log Book
  
    Problem
    -------
    The Print log book [LRAPBK] option is not utilizing the LR AP SURGERY
    REFERENCE parameter definition so the report is incorrectly
    displaying the source of copied surgery information when being
    printed.
   
    Solution
    -------- 
    Routine LRAPBK will be modified to only print the surgery information
    when the LR AP SURGERY REFERENCE parameter is set to YES.  When it's
    set to NO, the information will be omitted on the report.
  
    Routine: LRAPBK
  
 9. INC000000814463 - Microbiology Summary List Issue
  
    Problem
    -------
    The Summary list (supervisors') [LR SUP SUMMARY] option is no longer
    displaying accessions verified by the micro techs on site.  However,
    it is displaying accessions verified by remote techs that access the
    site.
   
    Solution
    -------- 
    Routine LRMINEW1 will be modified to also include the timestamp when
    the XXX RPT DATE APPROVED field is updated with a new date.
  
    Routine: LRMINEW1
  
 10. INC000000812788 - Not allowed to enter UID at accession prompt  
  
     Problem
     -------  
     LEDI IV added the ability to use a UID in the micro option Results entry
     [LRMIEDZ], but it only works at the first accession number prompt at the
     start of the option. When you are into the option and come to the next
     accession number prompt the option doesn't allow the UID to be used.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Routine LRMIEDZ2 will be modified to allow the ability to enter the UID
     at the next accession number prompt. 
   
     Routine: LRMIEDZ2 
  
 11. INC000000823702 - Test result not displaying when viewing alert
     Duplicate:
     INC000000842226 - VA Alerts do not show all of Lab results
  
     Patient Safety Issue
     --------------------
     PSPO #2408 - VistA/CPRS alerts do not show all of the laboratory 
                  results
  
     Problem
     -------  
     If two tests on a Lab order have the same Print Order, it is possible
     that one of them will not display when viewing an alert for the
     results. Similar issue occurs if the user right-clicks an order in
     CPRS and chooses "results".
  
     Solution
     --------
     Routine was modified to make sure that when sorting the results in the
     TMP global that tests with the same print order do not overwrite each
     other. 
   
     Routine: LR7OR1
  
 12. INC000000830122 - Issue with AP Comments field
  
     Problem
     -------

     Routines: LR7OSAP, LRAPBR1, LRAPCUM, LRSPRPTA
  
 13. INC000000782825 - 2 Microbiology printing
     Duplicates:
     INC000000783053 - MAN-LR-LR SUP SUMMARY not working for Micro
                       accessions since LEDI IV installed
     INC000000784376 - 2 Summary reports not working post LEDI IV install
     INC000000818452 - MIW - Lab - LEDI:
     INC000000816184 - Microbiology Supervisor's Summary List
     INC000000839689 - Lab - LEDI:
  
     Problem
     -------
     The Summary list (supervisors') [LR SUP SUMMARY] option is no longer
     displaying verified accessions on the report.
  
     Solution
     -------- 
     Routine LRLIST will be modified to not include the timestamp when
     comparing the XXX RPT DATE APPROVED field with the date selected
     by the user for the report.
  
     Routine: LRLIST
  
 14. INC000000781464 - Surgical Path next accession number available 
                       problem
  
     Problem
     -------
     When logging in an AP specimen, the system is defaulting to the next 
     available number that follows the last accession number logged in,
     instead of defaulting to the first available number.
  
     Solution
     -------- 
     To avoid having any skipped AP accession numbers, this patch will
     change the way the system assigns a default accession number when a
     case is logged in via option 'Log-in, anat path' [LRAPLG]. Previously,
     the system defaulted to the next available number that followed the
     last accession number that was used. This patch changes it so that
     every time an AP accession is logged in, the system starts searching
     from the beginning (#1), and the first available accession number that
     is found in that accession area will be used as the default accession
     number for the new case being logged in (note: the user will still be
     able to override the default, and select a different accession number,
     if they so choose). For sites that want to keep the original method of
     assigning a default AP accession number, a new Parameter is being
     introduced that will let the site configure which method the system
     should use. This new parameter, 'Method of Assigning AP Accession
     Number', can be edited via the option 'Package Level Parameter Edit'
     [LR7O PAR PKG] on the 'Update CPRS Parameters' [LR7O PARAM MENU] menu.

 2. The LEDI IV installation inadvertently removed the SNOMED CODE field 
    (#2) as an Identifier for files TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) and ETIOLOGY
    FIELD (#61.2). To make the field an Identifier again, a user with
    programmer access and access to the option Identifier [DIIDENT] under
    the Utility Functions [DIUTILITY] FileMan menu can designate the field
    as an Identifier again.
