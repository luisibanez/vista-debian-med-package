Subject: INPUT TRANSFORM ERROR CAUSING DATA VERIFICATION ERROR

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses an issue involving the VA FileMan Verify Field 
 utility, which gives mixed results on outputs. This patch will update the 
 data dictionary only. It does not contain any routines nor will it update 
 or change data stored at the site.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000095444 - FM verify field utility gives mixed results on 
                      outputs
  
    Problem:  
    --------
    The FileMan Verify Field utility will use a field's input transform to 
    verify the integrity of the data stored for the selected field in the
    selected file. When the Verify Field utility is used on the WKLD SUFFIX
    CODE field (#1) in the WKLD SUFFIX CODE FILE (#64.2), the output is not
    consistent. When the output is queued to a print device, the output 
    states that both the data will fail the input transform, and the data 
    item is a duplicate record. When the output is sent to a print device 
    without it being queued, the output finds no problems. This is
    incorrect. The output of the Verify Field utility using the input
    transform of the WKLD SUFFIX CODE field (#1) should state it is
    duplicate data whether it is queued or not.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Remove the '$D(DIU(0)) logic test from the input transform.
  
    Technical Description:
    ---------------------- 
    The input transform is currently defined as this:
    S X1=$P(X,".",2) Q:X1="0000"  K:X1>9999!(X1<1)!(X'?1"."4.5N) X I 
    '$D(DIU(0)), $D(X),$D(^LAB(64.2,"F",X)) D EN^DDIOL("Duplicate
    Code","","!?20") K X
  
    The problem is the '$D(DIU(0)) logic test. The DIU(0) is an optional 
    variable used to hold input parameter values used by the EN^DIU2, a
    Data Dictionary Deletion utility routine. When the output is queued,
    this variable is not passed to TaskMan. While queued, the verification
    process will reach this point and find the DIU(0) undefined and quit.
    It will not complete the verification process and check the
    ^LAB(64.2,"F") index. This index will contain a copy of the code and
    display the "Duplicate Code" message, is what it should do, whether the
    output is queued or not.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
   
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  Users may be on the system.
   
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
   
     2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
        the Installation menu.
   
     3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*426)
   
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
   
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package LR*5.2*426
   
     5. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        NO//" respond NO.
   
     6. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
