Subject: VM patch to address some LOINC-related problems

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses 3 LOINC-related issues in the Lab package.
  
 1.  The LR LOINC LOOKUP [Find LOINC for Vista Lab Test] option won't
     accept default.
  
 2.  The LR LOINC PRINT RESULT NLT [Lab Tests With/Without Result NLT 
     Codes Print] option prints MI (Microbiology) and BB (Blood Bank) tests
     when it should only print CH (Chemistry) tests.
  
 3.  The LR LOINC PRINT RESULT NLT [Lab Tests With/Without Result NLT 
     Codes Print] option prints profiles (cosmic tests) when it should only
     print individual tests (atomic tests).
  
  
 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ==================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*418 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*418 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000519573     -  LR LOINC LOOKUP won't accept default
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The LR LOINC LOOKUP [Find LOINC for Vista Lab Test] option asks you to
     enter a lab test and a specimen. The option should then return the
     LOINC code associated with the entered lab test and specimen along
     with the related LOINC code information from the LAB LOINC file
     (#95.3). It fails to do this, returning a "??" instead. The "??"
     should only be returned when there is no LOINC code for the entered
     test/specimen. This problem is caused by a poorly constructed FileMan
     lookup into the LAB LOINC file (#95.3).
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRLNC1 to get the LOINC code from LABORATORY TEST file
     (#6O) and then use that LOINC code for the lookup into the LAB LOINC
     file (#95.3).
  
     Routine:    LRLNC1
  
  
  
  
 2:  HD0000000591734   -   Result NLT report prints MI and BB tests
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The report that is printed from the LR LOINC PRINT RESULT NLT [Lab 
    Tests With/Without Result NLT Codes Print] option should only print
    CH subscripted tests, but the report is pulling MI and BB subscripted
    tests into the report. MI and BB subscripted tests do not get LOINC
    coded.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRLNCNLT to not print any MI or BB subscripted tests
    on the report.
  
    Routine:  LRLNCNLT  
  
  
 3.  HD0000000084781 - LOINC option issue, result NLT report print problem
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The LR LOINC PRINT RESULT NLT [Lab Tests With/Without Result NLT Codes 
    Print] option allows you to print a list of lab tests with or without
    Result NLT Codes. Only atomic (stand-alone) tests should have Result
    NLT Codes but the option prints atomic and cosmic (panel of tests)
    tests, making it difficult to find the tests that you need to
    concentrate your attention on.
    
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRLNCNLT to omit cosmic tests (panels).
  
    Routine:    LRLNCNLT
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
 can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*418.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
