 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000594743       -  Problem with PRINT PPOC LABEL option.
  
     Problem
     -------
     The LRHY PPOC LABEL PRINT [PRINT PPOC LABEL] option does not print 
     an accession label when only 1 accession is selected from a group of 2
     or more accessions. If more than 1 accession is selected, labels print
     as they should.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRHYAFT to print accession label even if only 1
     accession is selected from a group of 2 or more accessions.
  
     Routine:    LRHYAFT
  
 2.  HD0000000725041     -   Data on screen runs together in PRINT PPOC 
                             LABELS option.
   
     Problem
     -------
     The sequence number, accession number, and collection sample all run
     together on the screen at one point while running the LRHY PPOC LABEL 
     PRINT [PRINT PPOC LABEL] option.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRHYAFT to put some spaces between these data elements
     for easier reading.
  
     Routine:  LRHYAFT  
  
    
 3.  HD0000000601619     -  Issue with accessioning Blood Cultures
  
     Problem
     -------
     If an MI-subscripted test (Microbiology) is the only test on an order
     and the site/specimen is not urine, the HOWDY software will not 
     accession the test.
    
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRHYB to accession MI-subscripted tests regardless of 
     the site/specimen.
  
     Routine:    LRHYB
  
 4.  HD0000000619387     -  Howdy PATIENT WAIT TIME report not accurate
     Duplicate(s):
     HD0000000714423     -  HOWDY REPORTING PROBLEMS
  
     Problem
     -------
     The LRHY PATIENT WAIT TIME [PATIENT WAIT TIME] option gives inaccurate
     results because the code gets the arrival time for the first patient
     of a session and uses that same arrival time for all subsequent
     patients in that session. This causes the report to give inaccurate
     (too long) wait times for most patients listed on the report.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRHYBC1 to get the current time for each patient when
     they are logged in.
  
     Routine:    LRHYBC1
  
 5.  HD0000000716798     -  Problem with Howdy WAIT TIME report Header for 
                            Accession.
  
     Problem
     -------
     When running the LRHY PATIENT WAIT TIME [PATIENT WAIT TIME] option, 
     the report has a column for the accession number for each patient, but
     the data appearing in that column is not always the accurate accession
     number. It is a "fabricated" accession number consisting of the first
     2 characters of the accession area name followed by a date and
     sequential number. There may be more than 1 accession area name with
     the same first 2 characters such that it is unclear what the real
     accession number is. 
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRHY4X to get the "actual" accession number from the
     ACCESSION field (#15) of the ACCESSION NUMBER subfile (#68.02) of the
     ACCESSION file (#68).  Print this accession number under the ACCN
     heading in the report.
  
     Routine:    LRHY4X
   
 6.  HD0000000720853     -  Subscript error - <SUBSCRIPT>LST1^LRHYLS1.
  
     Problem
     -------
     Routine LRHYLS1 sets a variable (LRHOWDT) to the order date in the
     LAB ORDERS file (#69) "C" cross reference for the order number in 
     question. If the order has been purged, the variable gets set to null,
     which subsequently leads to the <SUBSCRIPT> error.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Remove these lines of code from routine LRHYLS1 as the lines in 
     question are not used later in the program.  Removal of these lines of
     code will have no impact on the functioning of this routine.
  
     Routine:    LRHYLS1
  
 7.  HD0000000617792    -  Issue with link in Howdy document
  
     Problem
     -------
     On page 5 of the HOWDY document for IT staff, which resides in the
     VA Software Document Library, there is a hyperlink that points to
     a local file entry which contains a program for formatting the 
     magnetic card reader. This link needs to be changed to point to the 
     manufacturer's web site.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify the document in question (HOWDY Reference Manual for Local IT
     Staff) to replace the link to a local file entry with a link to the 
     manufacturer's web site. The proper link is:

  The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
  installed when Laboratory users are on the system. NOTE: Kernel patches
  must be current on the target system to avoid problems loading and/or
  installing this patch.

   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*417.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//',
       choose 'NO'.
