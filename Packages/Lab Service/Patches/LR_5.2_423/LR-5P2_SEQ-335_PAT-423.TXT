Subject: ERRORS WITH BUILDING COLLECTION LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a VM patch that addresses 2 issues in the Lab package.
  
 1. In building the collection list, if an order fails to accession, 
    it can cause subsequent orders to fail to accession also, even though
    the subsequent orders are ok.
  
 2. Laboratory-related locking issues when doing accessioning

 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*423 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000707524  -  Multiple errors encountered when building 
                             collection list
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Normally. when building the collection list and accessioning lab
    collect orders to the appropriate accession area, the division
    (institution) used is determined by the institution pointed to by the 
    ordering location in the Hospital Location file (#44). If, in building
    a collection list, an ordering location is encountered that points to
    an institution other than the institution associated with the user, as
    found in DUZ(2), the non-DUZ(2) institution may be used to try to
    accession subsequent orders, leading to accessioning errors.
   
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRPHSET1 to use the institution from the user, DUZ(2),
    when an ordering location is encountered that is not linked to an
    institution.
  
    Routine:  LRPHSET1  
  
 2. HD0000000725408  -  Laboratory-related locking issues when doing    
                         accessioning
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Non-compliance with SACC standards leads to locking issues during
    accessioning.
  
    2.4.6.1 All LOCKs shall be of the incremental form. (Exemption: Kernel)
         All incremental LOCKS must have a timeout, the timeout must not 
         be less than the value of the Kernel variable "DILOCKTM".
   
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify the incremental lock in routine LROE to use the variable
    DILOCKTM as the timeout value rather than 1 second.
  
    Routine:    LROE
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
 can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*423.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
