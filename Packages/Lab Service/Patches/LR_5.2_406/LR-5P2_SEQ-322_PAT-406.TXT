Subject: SOME ALERTS FOR LAB TEST RESULTS ARE NOT SENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses Patient Safety Issue PSPO #1384 which involves
 critical lab test result alerts.  When a lab test result is verified
 and that result lies outside the normal boundaries defined for the
 test, alerts are generated that are sent to the physicians who are
 responsible for the patient's care.  In some cases these alerts are
 not being generated.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000311272 - Critical lab alert not being sent
  
     Patient Safety Issue PSPO #1384 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Sometimes a group of lab tests are ordered for a patient and the
     test results for these tests are not all entered and verified at
     the same time.  When this happens, a test result of "pending" is
     sometimes stored in the LAB DATA file (#63).  If "pending" is
     stored as a result for a test in file 63 and then an abnormal/critical
     result is entered and verified, the code does not generate an OBX
     segment (results segment) in the HL7 message and therefore the alerts
     are not sent out to the appropriate physicians and/or caregivers.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRVER3 to set a new node in the LRSA array to indicate
     this condition (a result of "pending" stored in file 63).  This node 
     will be LRSA(test#,3). Also modify routine LR7OB63 to look for this
     node when creating the ^TMP("LRX") global. This ^TMP("LRX") global is
     subsequently used to generate the HL7 message which in turn triggers
     the alerts and notifications when appropriate (results outside of
     reference range).

 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE:
 =====================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*406 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*406 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*406 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch may be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*406.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
