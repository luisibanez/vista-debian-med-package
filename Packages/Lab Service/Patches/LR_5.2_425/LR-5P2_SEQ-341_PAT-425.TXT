 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*425 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*425 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 1 routine and 3 
 files identified in ProPath standard titled: BBM Team Review of VistA 
 Patches, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.

 Functional Description
 ======================
 1. Laboratories currently establish business rules that define how long a 
    pending order is valid. For example: a lab might decide that an order 
    scheduled for collection more than 90 days in the past is no longer 
    valid. This patch automates those business rules by introducing a new 
    parameter: LRJ OBSOLETE PENDING ORDERS. This allows the site to define 
    how many days in the past an order is considered valid. If that date 
    passes, then a TaskMan job will cancel the order in lab and notify 
    the Order Entry/Results Reporting (OERR) V3.0 system to change the
    order status to lapsed.
  
  
 2. Hospital Location changes made in the VistA Admission/Discharge/Transfer
    (ADT) system can be significant to Lab when locating inpatients for
    specimen collection.  This patch provides hospital location change
    reporting tools.  The following functionality is introduced:
  
   o  Hospital Location Initial Extract: This is a predefined report that 
      will pull the required information from VistA ADT in an extract to
      verify lab related locations, beds & rooms.  ("Lab related" locations
      are Clinic, Ward, or Operating Room type locations.)
  
   o  Hospital Location Change Monitoring System (HLCMS): The Hospital
      Location Change Monitoring tool supports scheduled notifications
      to designated staff and alerts them of changes to the VistA hospital
      locations so lab configurations can be adjusted, as necessary.
  
   o  Hospital Location Monitor - Contains tools to define the Lab 
      sub-system that controls monitoring of Hospital Location changes 
      affecting Lab.  The tool set contains viewers for extracted raw data 
      and mail messages.
  
  
 3. Lab Test Audit File 60 Tool: The Laboratory Test File 60 Audit Tool 
    monitors changes made to the VistA LABORATORY TEST(#60) file. This
    file must be kept in synch with a COTS lab system so that if any 
    item is not working, the user can identify changes recently made to 
    this file for the purpose of troubleshooting. This benefits the sites
    for any future lab capability solution and it will leverage VistA Lab
    Test Order Catalog and CPRS.
  
  
 4.  Monitor Laboratory Test File Changes Affecting Quick Orders: The
     Laboratory users requested that when certain fields are updated in the
     LABORATORY TEST (#60) file, it triggers a CPRS call to search for
     quick orders that contain the test that was updated. If any are found,
     the appropriate personnel are notified.
  
  
 5. Inactivation of Topography and Collection Sample File entries:
  
   o Allows sites to inactivate entries in TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61)
     and COLLECTION SAMPLE file (#62).  This reduces the number of valid
     selections for providers when entering orders in CPRS and when
     defining new lab tests. The order entry process for the provider is
     improved, and Lab workflow benefits because of fewer mistakes caused
     by improper selections during the ordering process.  This results in
     improvement of the order entry process for the provider and the
     processing for the Lab resulting in fewer corrections to make.
  
   o The STS extract for SNOMED requests will include the inactive date of
     entries in the TOPOGRAPHY FIELD and COLLECTION SAMPLE files. With the
     introduction of the SNOMED CT ID codes by STS (LEDI IV) the sites can
     use the Inactive field in Collection Sample and Topography to reduce 
     the number of "duplicate SNOMED CT ID assignment" entries. This will
     make for better quality order/result information that may be crossing
     to the HDR repository.
  
  
 6. The following issue was addressed: 
  
   o On the STS extract for SNOMED requests, if an entry is mapped to an
     inactive SCT code it displays the inactive date.  The date however, is
     displaying in FileMan format. The user requested it be displayed in
     human readable format instead.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.domain.ext, which will transmit the files from the first
 available FTP server.
  
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
 specific server as follows:
  
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext
  
 The documentation distribution includes:

 (3) Documentation can also be retrieved from VISTA Document Library (VDL)
 on the VA Intranet at the following address, http://vista.domain.ext/vdl.
  
  
 Patch Installation:
 ===================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre and post installation routine is LR425.  Sites may delete routine 
 LR425 after the patch is installed.
  
 The pre-installation routine checks to be sure the site has the mail 
 group LMI defined.  If the mail group cannot be found, the patch 
 installation will be aborted and an alert will be sent to the installer.  
 Add the mail group and then re-start the patch installation.
  
 The post-installation routine performs the following functions: 
 -       Enables Fileman auditing for HLCMS (Hospital Location monitoring)
 -       Enables auditing for selected LABORATORY TEST file (#60) fields
 -       Checks/sets the initial parameters for Monitor Laboratory Test 
         File Changes Affecting Quick Orders
 -       Upon successful patch installation, an install completion alert 
         is sent to mail group LMI
