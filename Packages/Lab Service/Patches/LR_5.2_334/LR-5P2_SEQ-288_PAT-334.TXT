 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE
 ====================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*334 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*334 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*334 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENT BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.
 ====================== 
  
 ENHANCEMENTS:
  
 Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes [LR LOINC MAP]
 This option has been modified to permit the use of suffixed WKLD CODE 
 in the NATIONAL VA LAB CODE (#64) field, of the LABORATORY TEST (#60) 
 file. This modified option is located on the LOINC Main Menu [LRLOINC] 
 menu
  
 Print LOINC Code Status [LR LOINC STATUS PRINT]
 This patch will provide an option to list LOINC deprecated terms. The 
 option will also provide a list of currently mapped/linked laboratory 
 tests that are linked to LOINC deprecated terms. This new option is 
 located on the LOINC Mapping Utility Menu [LR LOINC UTILITY] menu. 
  
  
 This patch will support "Veterans Health Administration Unique 
 Identifiers (VUID) standard. This patch will provide the necessary LAB 
 LOINC (#95.3) file data dictionary modifications in support of Data 
 Standardization (DS) and the maintenance of those standards by Enterprise 
 Reference Terminology (ERT).
  
 LAB LOINC (#95.3) file protection has been significantly enhanced to 
 prevent field editing of the file. All fields will be populated by the DS 
 authority, there are no fields in this file that are site editable.
  
 LAB LOINC (#95.3) file contents will be updated to the Regenstrief issued 
 LOINC version 2.14.
  
 This patch will update the WKLD CODE (#64) file and several laboratory 
 standardized files associated with National Laboratory Test (NLT) package 
 and Logical Observation Identifier Naming Codes (LOINC) coding. (See list 
 below)

 ===========================
 OPTIONS:
  
 NEW OPTION:
 Print LOINC Code Status [LR LOINC STATUS PRINT]
 This patch will provide an option to list LOINC deprecated terms. The 
 option will also provide a list of currently mapped/linked laboratory 
 tests that are linked to LOINC deprecated terms. This new option is 
 located on the LOINC Mapping Utility Menu [LR LOINC UTILITY] menu. 
  
 MODIFIED OPTION:
 Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes [LR LOINC MAP]
 This option has been modified to permit the use of suffixed WKLD CODE 
 in the NATIONAL VA LAB CODE (#64) field, of the LABORATORY TEST (#60) 
 file. This modified option is located on the LOINC Main Menu [LRLOINC] 
 menu.
  
 =========================
  
 DATA DICTIONARY MODIFICATIONS:
  
 The screen has been removed from "NATIONAL VA LAB CODE" (#64) field, of 
 the "LABORATORY TEST" (#60) file. This will permit the use of suffixed 
 WKLD CODE in the NATIONAL VA LAB CODE (#64) field, of the LABORATORY 
 TEST(#60) file.
  
 "AD" cross-reference has been created on the "STATUS" (#20) field of the 
 "LAB LOINC" (#95.3) file. This cross-reference will provide a listing of 
 LOINC codes that have a status update.
  
 The patch creates the following fields in the LAB LOINC (#95.3) file: 
 MASTER ENTRY FOR VUID field (#99.98), VUID field (#99.99), and EFFECTIVE 
 DATE/TIME field multiple (#99.991) with an Effective DATE/TIME field 
 (95.3099,.01) and STATUS field (95.3099,.02) which includes a date/time 
 stamp and a status of 'active' or 'inactive' in the files being 
 standardized.
  
 This patch also modifies data dictionaries to prevent future modification 
 to these files at a local site.

                 Backup a Transport Global
          3. Users may remain on the system, but installation 
             should be done at off peak hours.
          4. Installation time is less than 30 minutes during off 
             peak hours and less than 45 minutes during peak hours.
          5. Installation of this patch requires no additional 
             memory space.
          6. From the 'Installation Menu' of the KIDS menu, run the 
             option
             'Install Package(s)' Select the package 'LR*5.2*334' 
             and proceed with the install.
          7. Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? 
              YES// respond 'YES'
  
               Note: Answering yes can significantly increase install time.
  
           8. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the
             install? YES//' respond NO.
           9. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE scheduled Options, Menu
             Options, and Protocols? YES//' respond NO.

 POST INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =============================
 Review installed LOINC codes to ensure that codes with the status of 
 Deprecated (DEL) are not used in your current mapping of LOINC codes. In 
 some cases, deprecated LOINC codes [LAB LOINC (#95.3) file, MAP TO (#21) 
 field] will have the suggested replacement LOINC code populated.
  
 Note:
 If your site is a HOST LEDI site, changing of any LOINC or NLT codes 
 should be coordinated with the collection site to ensure that both sites 
 agree in LOINC and NLT mappings.
  
 Note:
  Please refer to the VistA NLT/LOINC V2.14 UPDATE Patch LR*5.2*334 
  Implementation Guide which provides the Laboratory Information 
  Manager (LIM) a task-oriented approaches with step-by-step 
  instructions and examples for mapping LOINC V2.14 codes.
  
 After successful installation of the patch, delete the following 
 post-install routines;
