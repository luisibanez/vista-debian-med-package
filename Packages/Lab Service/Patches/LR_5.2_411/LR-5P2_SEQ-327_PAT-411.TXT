Subject: FIX PROBLEM WITH DELETION OF PRESELECTED LAB TEST/PATIENT LISTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a VM patch that addresses 3 issues in the Lab package.
  
 1. When trying to accession an order user gets the message "TEST 
    NAME does not have an appropriate accession area. Order xxxxx IS  
    NOT ACCESSIONED."
  
 2. The GROUP DATA REVIEW [LRGVP] option does not always show the
    proper report routing location.
  
 3. <UNDEFINED> error occurs when trying to delete old user-defined
    patient/test lists. 
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET:
 ========================
 1. HD0000000504691  -  More accessioning errors #3 - already accessioned
  
 2. HD0000000070072  -  Group data review location
  
 3. HD0000000389262  -  Error trap message <UNDEFINED> EN2+3^LRUMD

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000504691     -  More accessioning errors - already accessioned
  
  
     Problem
     ------------
     When using the Group Verify [LRGV] option, the variable LRDUZ(2) is
     sometimes created to hold the division of a reference lab.  That
     variable is not cleared during exit of the Group Verify [LRGV] option.
     If a user goes from the Group Verify [LRGV] option to an accessioning
     option, the presence of the variable LRDUZ(2) may prevent
     accessioning.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRGV to N(ew) the variable LRDUZ upon entry to the 
     Group Verify [LRGV] option so that the variable is gone when the Group
     Verify [LRGV] option is exited.
  
     Routine:    LRGV  
  
  
  
  
 2:  HD0000000070072     -  Group data review location 
  
    Problem:
    --------                                                           
  
    The GROUP DATA REVIEW [LRGVP] option prints the ward for inpatients
    and the report routing location for outpatients.  The report routing 
    location is currently obtained from a REPORT ROUTING field (#.1) in 
    the LAB DATA file (#63). This field is an old data item that is not
    always reliable and there is some discussion as to phasing out the
    usage of this data field.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modify routine LRGVP to get the REPORT ROUTING LOCATION field (#6)
    of ACCESSION NUMBER subfile (#68.02) of the ACCESSION FILE file (#68).
  
    Routine:  LRGVP  
  
  
  
  
 3.  HD0000000389262    -  Error trap message <UNDEFINED> EN2+3^LRUMD
     Duplicate(s):
       HD0000000439046  -  <UNDEFINED> error with Lab worksheet
  
  
    Problem
    ------------
    User-defined patient lists and user-defined lab test lists are stored
    in the USER REQUEST LIST subfile  (#69.28) of the LAB SECTION PRINT
    FILE file (#69.2). LAST DATE USED field (#.02) of USER REQUEST LIST
    subfile (#69.28) is used to allow users to delete lists that have not
    been used in a user-specified amount of time. When user-defined test
    lists are created/modified in CPRS (user-defined patient lists can not
    be created in CPRS), the global level which holds the LAST DATE USED
    field (#.02) is not created or updated.  When a user goes in to delete
    some old unused patient/test lists the code is expecting this global
    level to be there.  When it is not there an <UNDEFINED> error ensues.
  
  
    Solution
    ------------
    Modify routine LR7OGO to create/update the global level containing
    the LAST USED DATE when a user-defined test list is created or
    modified in CPRS.  Also, routine LRUMD is modified to not error when
    this global level is missing if a user tries to delete old patient
    lists or old test lists. A post-init routine, LR411PST, is also
    created that will go through the USER REQUEST LIST subfile (#69.28) 
    and add the missing global level for users when this global level is
    missing.  A MailMan message is sent to the patch installer detailing
    which users were updated. 
  
    The subject line will display as follows:
  
    Subj: PATCH LR*5.2*411 POST-INIT RESULTS  
  
    Once the message has been obtained, no further actions are required.
  
    Routine:    LR7OGO   LRUMD   LR411PST
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*411.
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
  
   7.  You may delete routine LR411PST upon successful installation of the 
       patch.
