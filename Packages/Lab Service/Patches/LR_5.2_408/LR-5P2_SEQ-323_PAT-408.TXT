Subject: DISABLE VISTA BLOOD BANK ENTRY/EDIT OPTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 LR*5.2*408 finalizes the transition from VistA Version 5.2 Blood Bank 
 package to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 system. Sites with VBECS have already disabled the VistA Version 5.2 
 Blood Bank package when database conversion was executed with the records 
 remaining in VistA available as read-only information. The Enter/Edit 
 options for VistA Version 5.2 Blood Bank are permanently disabled with 
 the installation of this patch regardless if a database conversion 
 was performed at the site or if the Blood Bank package is being used.

 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no unintended impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK 
 SOFTWARE control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*408 have no unintended effect 
 on Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*408 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 40 routines and 
 0 files identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 
 2004-058, group B listing. The changes have no unintended effect on Blood 
 Bank functionality or medical device control functions. The adverse 
 potential to sites is limited to the disabling of the VistA Blood Bank 
 Version 5.2 Enter/Edit functionality.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: 
 ==================================
 The options affected by this patch are being disabled and do not 
 require validation. 
  
 Local validation of the remaining VistA 5.2 Blood Bank options 
 not disabled by the installation of LR*5.2*408 would only extend to 
 verifying access to the options. Sites can view data or run reports 
 from options not included in this patch description. 
  
 MINIMAL TEST CASE SCENARIOS BY OPTION, INCLUSIVE OF ALL CONTROL FUNCTIONS:
 ==========================================================================
 There are no test case scenarios for this patch.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS: 
 ========================== 
  
 Note: Users must not access VistA Blood Bank Version 5.2 options during 
 the installation of this patch.
  
 No laboratory background jobs need to be stopped. No options need to be 
 placed out of service.
  
 This patch may be loaded with users on the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter LR*5.2*408):
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
  
       NOTE:
       The Compare Transport Global will generate the following warning 
       for the Routine LRUWG:
  
       *** WARNING, your routine has different patches than the incoming
       routine ***
  
       This is an expected result for this routine. Ignore this message 
       and continue with the installation. This warning is reported 
       because the LRUWG routine has not been patched/modified previously 
       and the Compare Transport Global routine is expecting that all 
       routines will have a prior version statement on the second line, 
       which this routine does not. This issue is documented to be fixed 
       in patch XU*8*547.
  
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
    
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       LR*5.2*408.
    
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//', respond NO.
    
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
