Subject: SOME ANATOMIC PATHOLOGY ROUTINE FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a VM patch that addresses 3 issues related to the
 Anatomic Pathology area of the Lab package.
  
 1.  When using option LRAPMOD (Print path modifications) an 
     <UNDEFINED> error is occurs.
  
  
 2.  When a date is typed in the EXPIRATION DATE field (#3), of the PERSON
     CLASS MULTIPLE file (#200.05), of the NEW PERSON file (#200), for a
     provider, that same provider will not be able to verify/electronically
     sign Anatomic Pathology reports. This happens even if the date is a
     future date.
  
 3.  If more than one Special Studies selection is included in an Anatomic
     Pathology Report, the text of the subsequent Special Studies is not
     stored properly in the TIU document and thus doesn't display 
     in CPRS.
  
  
 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ==================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*413 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*413 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*413 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000503766     -  <UNDEFINED> PRTRPT+4^LRAPMOD
  
  
     Problem
     -------
     LRAPMOD (Print path modifications) is an option that prints all
     verified versions of an Anatomic Pathology report beginning with
     the most recent and going backwards in time.  The report uses
     routine LRAPTIUP to print the reports from TIU (Text Integration
     Utility).  The IEN, Internal Entry Number field (#.001) of the report
     in the TIU DOCUMENT file (#8925) is passed from routine LRAPMOD to
     routine LRAPTIUP. That IEN is also used to find the previous version 
     of the report in TIU. After LRAPTIUP prints the requested document,
     it KILLS the variable LRPTR, which is used to hold the IEN. When
     control is returned to LRAPMOD, the variable LRPTR is
     used to find the immediate preceding version of the report but it
     is now <UNDEFINED>.
  
  
     Solution
     --------
     Modify routine LRAPMOD to save the IEN (variable LRPTR is saved to
     variable LRSAVPTR) before calling routine LRAPTIUP. Then use the
     saved variable (LRSAVPTR) to find the next version of the report to
     print.
  
     Routine:    LRAPMOD  
  
  
  
  
 2:  HD0000000071061     -  Electronic signature 
  
    Problem
    -------
    Routine LRAPRES1 handles the verification and electronic signature for
    Anatomic Pathology reports.  In so doing, it checks for a date in the
    EXPIRATION DATE field (#3), in the PERSON CLASS MULTIPLE file
    (#200.05), of the NEW PERSON file (#200), for the person attempting to
    sign/release the report. If there is a date in the EXPIRATION DATE
    field (#3), the user is not able to sign/verify the report, even if it
    is a future date.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modify routine LRAPRES1 to check to see if there is an EXPIRATION DATE
    that is in the past before prohibiting the user from signing/verifying
    the report. 
  
    Routine:  LRAPRES1  
  
  
  
  
 3.  HD0000000070843     -  Post patch 259 Special Studies issues
  
  
    Problem
    -------
    If an Anatomic Pathology report contains more than one Special 
    Studies selection, the text for all of the Special Studies after the
    first one is not stored properly in the TIU (Text Integration Utility)
    and thus does not display in CPRS.
  
  
    Solution
    --------
    Two programming loops are required to pick up the text for all of the
    Special Studies associated with an Anatomic Pathology report. Currently
    one loop is not functioning properly.  The fix is to modify routine
    LRAPBR3 to get the second loop to function properly so that all Special
    Studies text is picked up.
  
    Routine:    LRAPBR3
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*413.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO//, choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
