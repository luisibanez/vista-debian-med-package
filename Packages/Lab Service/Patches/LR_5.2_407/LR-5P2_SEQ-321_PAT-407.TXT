Subject: ADDRESS 2 LOINC MAPPING PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Lab Service patch addresses 2 LOINC mapping issues.
  
    1.  When exiting the option "Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes" after no
        matches are found related to an affirmative response to the
        prompt "Do you want to see possible LOINC code matches?", an
        <UNDEFINED> error results.
  
    2.  The option to map a default LOINC code and the option to unmap a
        default LOINC code use the same routines.  Sometimes the code gets
        confused and prompts one to "unmap" when one is in the "map" 
        option.

 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*407 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*407 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 installation of this patch.
  
  
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000428829     -  Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes option error
  
  
     Problem
     ------------
     Lab option "Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes" asks if the user wants
     to see possible LOINC code matches.  If the user responds "YES"
     to this question and no possible matches are found, the user is
     returned to the original prompt "VistA Lab Test to Link/Map to
     LOINC :". If the user tries to exit the option with a "^" at this
     point, an <UNDEFINED> error occurs.
  
  
     Solution
     ------------
     Modify routine LRLNCMD to not clean up all the variables before
     returning to routine LRLNC0 where the <UNDEFINED> was occurring.
     This will allow routine LRLNC0 to clean up the variables upon
     exit.
  
     Routine:  LRLNCMD
  
  
 2:  HD0000000418688     -  Problem with LOINC mapping
  
  
    Problem
    ------------
    The problem is that the options "Map Lab Tests to Default LOINC
    Code" and "Unmap/Delete Lab Tests to Default LOINC Code" utilize
    the same code.  A $SELECT is used to determine the appropriate
    prompt based on the value of the variable LRDEL.  The convoluted
    code sometimes does not clear variable LRDEL when exiting from the
    "Unmap/Delete Lab Tests to Default LOINC Code" option thus causing
    the "Unmap/Delete" prompt to come up when user has entered the
    "Map" option.
  
    Solution
    ------------
    Modify routine LRLNC0 to always clear the variable LRDEL when
    exiting from the "Unmap/Delete" option.
  
    Routine:  LRLNC0
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify that
       all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*407.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
