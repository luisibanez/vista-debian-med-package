This patch is a VM lab patch that addresses 2 LOINC mapping issues.

"BLD",8568,1,3,0)
   1.  When exiting the option "Map Lab Tests to LOINC Codes" after no
"BLD",8568,1,4,0)
       matches are found related to an affirmative response to the
"BLD",8568,1,5,0)
       prompt "Do you want to see possible LOINC code matches?", an
"BLD",8568,1,6,0)
       <UNDEFINED> error results.
"BLD",8568,1,7,0)
 
"BLD",8568,1,8,0)
   2.  The option to map a default LOINC code and the option to unmap a
"BLD",8568,1,9,0)
       default LOINC code use the same routines.  Sometimes the code gets
"BLD",8568,1,10,0)
       confused and prompts one to "unmap" when one is in the "map" 
"BLD",8568,1,11,0)
       option.
