Subject: DD AND OPTION MODIFICATIONS

  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 items:
  
 1. The code contained in FileMan to delete the CANCELLED BY field (#10)
    has faulty syntax which leads to a <SUBSCRIPT> error.
  
 2. The routines which execute options Service Dictionary [LR WKLD SERVICE]
    and Requesting Center Dictionary [LR WKLD REQUEST] are reversed.
  
 3. During extraction of lab data for the Decision Support Software (DSS),
    it was discovered that some lab test names included a tilde (~) or an
    exclamation point (!) which caused the record parser to incorrectly
    identify the end of the record and thus skip pertinent data.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000343282 -  Bad delete X-ref in DD
  
    Problem:
    --------
    There is some faulty code in the delete cross-reference for field
    CANCELLED BY (#10) of the TEST multiple of the SPECIMEN subfile
    (#69.03) of the LAB ORDERS file (#69).  This faulty code leads to a
    <SUBSCRIPT> error when an entry in the CANCELLED BY field is
    deleted. This error prevents the deletion of a cross-reference entry,
    leaving the cross-reference in the file.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modified the Data Dictionary [^DD(69.03,10)] to correctly delete the 
    cross-reference.
  
    DD:  ^DD(69.03,10)  
  
  
 2. HD0000000390357 -  Option descriptions for LR WKLD SERVICE and LR WKLD
                       REQUEST
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The documentation in the Lab Users Manual and the help text state
    that option LR WKLD SERVICE lists all requesting locations by
    treating specialty (file #45.7) for a site while option LR WKLD
    REQUEST lists only treating specialties with abbreviations.  The 
    routines with execute these options are reversed.
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Modified the execution of the options to perform as described in the
    Lab Users Manual and the help text for the options.
  
    Option:  LR WKLD SERVICE and LR WKLD REQUEST  
  
  
 3. HD0000000452779 -  Lab extract error
  
    Problem
    ------------
    During extraction of lab data for the Decision Support Software (DSS)
    it was discovered that some lab test names included a tilde character
    (~), which is used as the end of record character during parsing of
    the lab information.  This caused the parser to incorrectly identify
    the end of the record and skip pertinent information.  
  
    While researching this issue, it was noted that the DATA NAME(#20) 
    field of the WKLD LOG FILE (#64.03) is populated with the NAME field 
    (#.01)in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) instead of the DATA NAME field
    (#400) in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60).
  
    Solution:
    ---------
    Routine LRCAPDSS is being updated to obtain the data from the DATA
    NAME field (#400) in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60) rather than
    from the NAME field (#.01) in the LABORATORY TEST file (#60).  In
    addition, upon retrieval of the DATA NAME field (#400)any tildes (~)
    or exclamation points (!) are converted to pound signs (#) before
    being stored in the WKLD LOG FILE (#64.03). The description of the
    DATA NAME field (#20) of the WKLD LOG FILE (#64.03) is also updated
    to show where this data is obtained from.
  
    Routine: LRCAPDSS
    DD:  ^DD(64.03,20)
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch can be
 installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*410.
       
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of 
       Install? NO// , choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
