Subject: COMPANION PATCH TO VBEC*1*27

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Routine

Description:
============

 LR*5.2*412 is exported as part of the VistA Blood 
 Establishment Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.6.0 release.
  
 VBECS related VistA patches require customer validation in local Test 
 accounts prior to installation in Production to meet Food & Drug 
 Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for 
 patient care.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OIT Field Operations coordinate the 
 installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & Laboratory 
 Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact analysis and 
 testing the changes prior to installation in Production. 
  
 The LR*5.2*412 patch, bundled and released with VBEC*1.0*27, addresses 
 several issues: 
  
  1. 102 VistA MR 120610 (HD 67954) - Fixed an error where the Date 
     Wanted field on the CPRS Blood Bank Report was displayed in the 
     internal FileMan format. The Date Wanted now correctly displays the 
     date. 
     No verification required. 
  
  2. 105 VistA MR 060311 - Fixed an error detected by development testing 
     of workload reporting. The error reports a missing DFN in the 
     workload event transmission from VBECS, but the code already ensures 
     that the DFN exists. The correction removes the error message. 
     No verification required.
  
  
 There is also a VBECS 1.6.0 server update patch that is also being 
 released. Please refer to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer 
 Software (VBECS) 1.6.0 Release Notes for detailed information 
 about corrections in that patch. These documents will be found in 
 the VBECS_1_6_0_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
