Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 LR*5.2*401 is exported as part of the VistA Blood Establishment 
 Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.5.1.0 release.
  
 VBECS related VistA patches require customer validation in local 
 Test accounts prior to installation in Production to meet Food & 
 Drug Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the 
 Blood Bank software for its intended use prior to its acceptance 
 and use for patient care.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OI&T Field Operations coordinate 
 the installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & 
 Laboratory Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact 
 analysis and testing the changes prior to installation in Production. 
  
  
 The LR*5.2*401 patch, in conjunction with VBEC*1.0*10 address several
 issues. Refer to the VBECS 1.5.1.0 Release Notes for sample validation 
 scenarios: 
  
  1. 092 VistA MR 032310 - This will move the check for workload
     transmissions from the XTMP global to a VBECS name spaced 
     global and limit the transmission of workload from VBECS to VistA 
     to once per day. 
  
  2. 094 VistA MR 041310 - This will correct problems with LMIP workload
     Reporting to the DSS extract. 
  
  3. 095 VistA MR 042210 - This will correct workload reporting problems
     with multidivisional LMIP by changing the IEN lookup process so 
     that each VBECS division in a shared server will transmit 
     uniquely identified workload to VistA.
  
  4. 097 VistA MR 060210 - This ensures workload processing in VistA 
     when a user ID is not recorded for a VBECS workload event. 
  
 There is also a VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 
 1.5.1.0 server update patch that is also being released. Please refer 
 to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) 1.5.1.0 
 Release Notes for detailed information about corrections in that patch. 
 These documents will be found in the VBECS_1_5_1_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
