Subject: UPDATE DATA EXTRACT LOGIC FOR DSS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The logic for selecting records to be included in the Decision Support 
 Software (DSS) laboratory results (LAR) extract is being modified.  
  
 Currently, lab tests that are collected at the end of the month but 
 aren't resulted until the following month are not counted during the 
 current month's extract period.
  
 The logic is being changed so that records that are skipped during the 
 extract process are stored for review when the next month's extract is 
 run.
