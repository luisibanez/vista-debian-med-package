Subject: ORDERED TESTS FILED UNDER WRONG PATIENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues in the Laboratory 
 Package:
  
 1. This ticket (HD0000000506977) addresses Patient Safety issue PSPO 
    #2070. A lab test ordered through CPRS may be misplaced on an order for
    the wrong patient in LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69).
  
 2. This ticket (HD0000000616913) was created because the LOCK 
    timeout is not in compliance with SACC guidelines.
  
 BLOOD BANK REVIEW:
 ==================
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*419 does not 
 contain any changes to the VISTA BLOOD BANK Software as defined by VHA 
 DIRECTIVE 2004-058 titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE VERSION 5.2.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LR*5.2*419 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LR*5.2*419 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: Because of the nature of the changes 
 made, no specific validation requirements exist as a result of 
 installation of this patch.

     PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES:
     ======================
     PSPO #2070
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When several tests are ordered for a patient within a 10 minute
     time span including midnight, one of the tests may be misplaced
     on an order for a different patient in LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69).
  
     In CPRS, several lab test orders for a patient can be signed
     simultaneously.  If the collection times for the orders are within
     10 minutes of each other, the code looks to combine the tests into
     one order.  This is fine if the 10 minute time span is within a single
     day.  However, if the 10 minute span includes midnight, then the
     tests should not be combined on the same order.  The function call
     $$INDAIR in routine LR7OF5 checks to see if the 2 orders under
     consideration for combining are for the same patient.  However, when
     this check reveals 2 different patients, the code does not set the
     flag which indicates that a separate order is required.  The result
     is either a test for 1 patient going to an order for a different 
     patient in LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69) or an incomplete sequence added 
     to LAB ORDER ENTRY file (#69). 
  
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify the function call $$INDAIR in routine LR7OF5 to set the flag,
     which indicates that a separate order is required when the 2 orders
     under consideration for combining are determined to be for 2
     different patients.
  
     Routine:    LR7OF5  
  
  
  
 2:  HD0000000616913     -  LOCK timeout not in compliance with SACC
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     There is an incremental LOCK in LR7OF5 with a timeout of 0.  With
     regard to LOCK timeouts, SACC says in section 2.4.6.1:
  
     2.4.6.1 All LOCKS shall be of the incremental form.(Exemption:Kernel)
             All incremental LOCKS must have a timeout, the timeout must
             not be less than the value of the Kernel variable DILOCKTM.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LR7OF5 to set the LOCK timeout to the value of the
     variable DILOCKTM if it exists.  If the variable does not exist,
     set the timeout to 3 seconds.
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
  
 The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
 can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system.  You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*419.
  
       If prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//,
       choose 'NO'.
  
       If prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', choose 'NO'.
