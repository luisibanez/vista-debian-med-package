Subject: MODIFY LRWLST1 TO ADDRESS IN-COMMON ACCESSIONING

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is a VM patch that addresses a problem in the Lab package
 related to accessioning with in-common accession areas. When an
 "in-common" accession area is added to an existing accession area, it
 is possible that data in file #68 (ACCESSION) will be overwritten and 2
 patients will have the same accession number.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1:  HD0000000464026      -  Issue with possible overwrite of patient
                             information in Lab
     Duplicate(s):
  
        HD0000000521518   -  FileMan DBS call failed during accessioning in
                             routine LRWLST1
  
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If an accession area (ACCAREA1) has an "in-common" accession area,
     (ACCAREA2), it means that the two accession areas have a common pool
     of accession numbers.  When accessioning occurs, routine LRWLST1
     gets the first unused accession number in the "in-common" accession
     area (ACCAREA2) and uses that accession number.  If that accession 
     number is already in use in ACCAREA1, data is overwritten in 
     file #68 (ACCESSION) for ACCAREA1, and you end up with 2 different
     patients with the same accession number.
  
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Modify routine LRWLST1 to check and make sure that the accession
     number under consideration is not already in use in either the
     "in-common" accession area (ACCAREA2) or the "originating" accession  
     area (ACCAREA1).

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 =========================
  
   The install time for this patch is less than 2 minutes. This patch
   can be installed when Laboratory users are on the system.
  
 NOTE: Kernel patches must be current on the target system
       to avoid problems loading and/or installing this patch.
  
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option of the PackMan menu.  This
       option will load the KIDS patch onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your

   3.  On the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' Menu (KIDS),
       select the 'Installation' menu.
  
   4.  Use the 'Verify Checksum in Transport Global' option and verify
       that all routines have the correct checksums.
  
   5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
         Print Transport Global
         Compare Transport Global to Current System
         Backup a Transport Global
  
       If you wish to preserve a copy of the routines exported in this 
       patch prior to installation, you should use the 'Backup a Transport
       Global' option at this time.  You may also compare the routines in
       your production account to the routines in the patch by using the
       'Compare a Transport Global to Current System' option.
  
  
   6.  Use the 'Install Package(s)' option under the 'Installation' menu
       and select the package 'LR*5.2*415.
