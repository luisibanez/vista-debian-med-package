Description:
============

 This document describes MAG*3.0*119, the VIX Maintenance patch.  
 This patch adds new features such as the ability to delete studies from 
 the VistA Imaging eXchange (VIX) cache to enhance user experience and 
 also fixes a few remedy ticket issues.  
  
 MAG*3.0*119 contains the following new functions:
  
 * Support native 64 bit windows deployment. 
 * Provide the ability to view deleted image placeholders for remote
   images.
 * Provide paging controls at the bottom of the Transaction log page.
 * Provide the ability to delete specific studies from the VIX cache.
 * Provide the ability to delete a patient and all associated studies from
   the VIX cache.
  
 MAG*3.0*119 corrects the following problems:
 * VistA RPC broker Failover
 * HTTP HEAD request for images to  facilitate eliminating the 
   ClientAbortException transaction log entries. 
   NOTE: VistARad fix needs to be implemented to fully correct this error.
 * Remedy ticket fixes
  
 NOTE: All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion
 of this patch. At sites that have implemented VistARad, installation of 
 both the KIDS and the client software is required; installation of the 
 client software may be phased in according to each site's needs. 
  
 This patch can be downloaded from:
 ftp.imaging.domain.ext/Software/Released_Software/Mag3_0P119
 KIDS Installation instructions are included in this document. For VIX 
 Installation instructions please refer to the VIX install guide.

 Remedy Calls
 ============
 This patch addresses the following Remedy help desk calls:
 1. Ticket 586252
  
 Problem: Deleted image placeholder - view Deleted Image Placeholders for 
 remote images
  
 Solution: VIX code was modified to request deleted image placeholders from
 VistA and to include those in results returned to the client (Clinical
 Display).
  
 2. Ticket 586250
  
 Problem: VistA RPC Failover
  
 Solution: The connection from the VIX to VistA is done using one of two 
 "styles" of connection, referred to simply as "old" and "new".  The VIX 
 will now, subject to configuration, attempt the "new" style connection 
 and, if that fails, try the "old" style connection.  The connections are 
 done in such a way as to prevent a failed attempt at the "new" style 
 connection from locking the client servicing thread. 
 NOTE: Default connection will be the "old" style connection.
  
 3. Ticket 586246
  
 Problem: Duplicating page controls on the bottom of the transaction log 
 page
  
 Solution: The existing page navigation controls (at the top of the page) 
 were duplicated and located at the bottom of the page.  The behavior and 
 appearance of the new controls are identical to the existing controls.
  
 4. Ticket 777931
  
 Problem: The full DoD study identifier is not being passed from the VIX 
 to the CVIX when the user requested the study from VistARad. 
  
 Solution: The VIX provides the full study identifier when requesting the 
 data from the CVIX
  
 5. Ticket 828186
  
 Problem: Exception occurs in the AWIV Web Application immediately after 
 the user logs in.
  
 Solution: The AWIV Web Application has been recompiled with the latest 
 toolkit to resolve the issue.
  
 6. Ticket 850266
  
 Problem: CVIX cannot retrieve list of reasons for printing an image from 
 sites that include a letter in the reason code.
  
 Solution: Parsing the reason code from VistA no longer assumes the reason 
 code is an integer to support letters.
