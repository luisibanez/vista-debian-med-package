Subject: STORING ALL DICOM OBJECTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 MAG*3.0*34 enables the storage of all composite DICOM objects that are
 transmitted to VistA Imaging in their original native DICOM format,
 without any alterations or format changes. Specifically, MAG*3.0*34 
 enables the storage of these classes of objects in DICOM format:
  
   - MAG*3.0*34 continues to support the storage of all Service Object 
 Pair (SOP) classes, which could be stored in DICOM format in MAG*3.0*99, 
 such as Digital X-Ray Image Storage, CT Image Storage, and MR Image 
 Storage. These images can be stored and displayed in VistARad and 
 Clinical Display.  They are referred to as previously supported SOP 
 classes.  They are referred to as newly supported SOP classes. The 
 ability to display these objects in the display clients will be added in 
 future patches.
  
   - In addition to the SOP classes that could be stored in their 
 original format in MAG*3.0*99, MAG*3.0*34 enables the storage of most 
 other Service Object Pair (SOP) classes that could not be stored in DICOM 
 format before. Examples of such SOP classes are multi-frame CTs, 
 multi-frame MRs, or structured reports. They are referred to as newly 
 supported SOP classes. The ability to display these objects in the 
 display clients will be added in future patches.
  
 Important
 Display of the newly supported SOP classes (DICOM objects) will be
 supported in future releases. You will not be able to view these objects
 in the display clients (Clinical Capture, Clinical Display, and VistA
 RAD). You can access these objects using the Query/Retrieve application.
  
 The patch features and benefits are detailed in the MAG*3.0*34 Patch 
 Description.

 Remedy Calls
 ============
 1. 752683- Ignoring Image
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A particular type of study creates a small report in addition to
 two images. The two radiology images cross, but the process window
 comes up with a statement to ignore the DCM image of the report. We would
 like for the additional DCM image to go into storage.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Storage for Structured Reporting is supported in MAG*3.0*34.
