Subject: AWIV INDEPENDENT OF VISTA WEB

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch provides users with the ability to access patient images using 
 VA approved versions of Internet Explorer using the AWIV Web Application. 
 When implemented, the VistA Imaging Advanced Web Image Viewer (AWIV) Web 
 Application, will let users locate and display any patient images stored 
 in VistA Imaging or available to the VA from the DoD. Currently, VistAWeb 
 only allows users to view images associated with a VA progress note or a 
 radiology report. 
  
 The AWIV is not intended for the primary interpretation of radiology 
 exams. When the AWIV is installed on approved and properly maintained 
 hardware, primary interpretation of other image types is permissible by 
 licensed practitioners at their discretion.
  
 The AWIV will continue to be available via the VistAWeb.
