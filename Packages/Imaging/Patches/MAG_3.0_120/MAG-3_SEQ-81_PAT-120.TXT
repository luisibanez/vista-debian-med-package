 Description
 ============
  
 Patch 120 provides support for the Windows 7 operating system.  The 
 client installation file included with this patch will execute on either 
 Windows XP or Windows 7.  Certain installation details differ according 
 to the target installation environment.
  
 NOTE:  Some legacy display adapters for high-resolution screens may no 
 longer be supported under Windows 7.
  
 Patch 120 includes these additional changes
  
  - Provides Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) integration at the
 user and patient context level. This facilitates integration with the
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) and other CCOW-enabled
 applications.
  
 VistARad workstations that are configured to enable radiologists to 
 interpret studies for multiple sites (that is, workstations with 
 connections to more than one VistA host) must not have CPRS and CCOW 
 installed. A safety risk arises within the patient context management when
 the disparate clinical applications are concurrently logged in to separate
 VistA host databases.
  
 Note that there are two mechanisms by which VistARad can be configured to 
 read for multiple sites:
  
 1.  Multiple "Connect to" destinations to separate VistA hosts are 
 defined in the Broker configuration settings; this is a machine-dependent 
 setting.
  
 2.  Users having the MAGJ REMOTE ACCESS CONTROL key can configure 
 "Monitored Sites" settings (on the "VIX Configuration" settings tab) to 
 connect to multiple sites. This is a user-level setting that is 
 independent of machine.
  
  - Changes to the Dictation interface where multiple locked exams may be
    open concurrently.  
  - Relocates certain files, that maintained on the client workstation, to
    a new storage location.
  - Fixes logic for automatically selecting the preferred hanging protocol
    for multi-modality exams.
  - Provides an optional pixel erase function prior to storing images to
    the Medical Imaging Resource Center (MIRC) Teaching file system.
  - Fixes a sporadic problem when scrolling in linked image stacks.
  - Fixes a problem opening large exams having numerous (e.g., more than
    75) series and scouts.
  - Adds Image Comments field to the default tab of the image data
    display.
  - Widens the Demand Route form prompt, "Default Route To" to better 
    display lengthy destination names.
  - Improves the results display for the maintenance menu option "ICPT--
    Inquire VistARad CPT Matching Set" [MAGJ INQUIRE CPT MATCHING SET].
  - Removes certain unused fields from MAG VISTARAD SITE PARAMETERS file
    (#2006.69).
  - Fixes a problem with incomplete updating of the Image Access Log.
  - Displays EHR Notes in the Requisition and Reports windows for Indian
    Health Service.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================
 This patch addresses the following Remedy help desk calls:
  
 Ticket #357161  Wrong date/time in exam list
  
 Problem: Sometimes the wrong date/time is displayed in the exam list.  
 This occurs for mixed modality exams imported from CD--the date that the 
 report was scanned in is displayed, instead of the date of the acquired 
 radiology images.
  
 Solution: A modification was made to always display the earliest date 
 found for a study.
  
 Ticket #407940  Modality column in VistARad
  
 Problem: When opening an exam with multiple modality codes, the preferred
 hanging protocol is not consistently found.
  
 Solution: Program logic was modified to present the multiple modality 
 codes in a consistent sequence so that the VistARad client's hanging 
 protocol search would key off of the preferred modality code value.
  
 Ticket #440204   How to correct MRI images
  
 Problem: The program failed to open a very large MR exam having numerous 
 sequences and scout images.
  
 Solution: The image data storage objects used by the Preview window were 
 re-designed to use a different type of data representation that requires 
 much smaller number of  Windows Resources (i.e., internal data objects).
  
 Ticket #462795 CT Linking issue
  
 Problem: Under certain circumstances with multiple CT series images 
 displayed, scrolling through one image stack would result in images of 
 other linked image stacks containing orthogonal image projections also 
 scrolling.  
  
 Solution: A bug in the program logic for detecting parallel vs. orthogonal
 image planes in linked stacks was corrected.
  
 Tickets #488381 & 500601  "Route To" list needs to be enlarged by 15 to 20
 Characters.
  
 Problem: The "Route To" list display on the Demand Route form truncates 
 some of the destination names because the form's field is not wide enough.
  
 Solution: The Demand Route form prompt, "Default Route To", has been 
 widened to better display lengthy destination names.
  
 Ticket #539237  Imaging issue when cluster uses failover node 
  
 Problem: In very rare instances, VistARad could not open images if the 
 Imaging cluster was configured to operate on the failover node.  This was 
 caused by a bug in handling an error reply message from the VIX server.
  
 Solution: The bug in handling the VIX error reply message was isolated 
 and corrected.
  
 Tickets #293535 & 539358  Odd window leveling on studies
  
 Problem: Odd window leveling behavior on some images since Patch 
 MAG*3.0*99. The problem occurs when performing a window/Level adjustment
 on MONOCHROME1 DICOM images. When dragging the cursor from right to left,
 the images become darker, whereas the expected response is to become
 brighter.
  
 Solution: The program was modified so that images become brighter when 
 dragging right to left; this response is consistent for both MONOCHROME1 
 and MONOCHROME2 images.
  
 Ticket #581717  Issue with Report window 
  
 Problem: Under certain circumstances with the VistARad Manager window on 
 screen, after clicking the Report button the Report window remains hidden 
 behind the Manager window.
  
 Solution: The logic controlling the display of the Report window was 
 modified to allow it to consistently display on top of the Manager window
  
 Ticket #584441  DICOM MR and RF images window level display and 
 adjustments are incorrect 
  
 Problem: The DICOM images for certain modalities either display 
 incorrectly on initial presentation (e.g., images washed out) or respond 
 to dynamic window/leveling incorrectly (images get darker instead of 
 brighter as expected).  
  
 Solution: The logic controlling the initial display and window/level 
 adjustments for images having pixel representation of MONOCHROME1 has 
 been corrected.
