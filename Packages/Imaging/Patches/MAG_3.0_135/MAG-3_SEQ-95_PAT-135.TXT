Subject: NETWORK LATENCY AND QUEUE MANAGEMENT ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

  - Other

Description:
============

 Due to a recent increase in network latency incidents resulting in OS 
 timeouts or I/O errors, MAG*3.0*135 is necessary to address 
 these situations where the BP storage applications halt, the queue counts 
 go negative, and the operator cannot get to the failed queue details to 
 determine what the problem is. Fixing all three BP applications is the 
 strategy utilized to harden the BP against network timeouts and to make 
 the BP applications more tolerant of different storage configurations.
  
 Network latency incidents have been exacerbated by:
 1. Import API Active X control introduced by Patch MAG*3.0*121 (released
    3/23/12), which causes a MAGImportXcontrol1.ocx error on the BP.
  
 2. Problems exhibiting more visibly through the new Remote Data Processing
    Center (RDPC) architecture.
 3. CRISP-related security changes, which have decreased sites access to
    the hospital database, thereby limiting their ability to resolve their 
    own problems or facilitate Clin3 to do the same.
  
 4. Sites are becoming increasingly challenged by the lack of storage 
    space, which raises the level of exposure to known issues with
    deployed software: 
      * For integrated sites only, the BP Verifier may check data integrity
        for the incorrect site after access/verify codes are edited at one
        of the sites.
      * The BP Purge does not differentiate between a regular image and a
        photo ID when removing image files from the Tier 1 storage . Photo
        IDs have been implemented at some sites, such as Cleveland, as
        Photo ID object types rather than setting the Type Index as
        expected by the software. This can have a high impact on negative
        results from a purge and can cause thousands of entries in the   
        JBTOHD (Jukebox to Hard disk) queue every day. The JBTOHD task
        populates the VistA Imaging shares with images that have been
        deleted from the Tier 1 shares through the Purge function.
  
 This patch provides new Queue Manager menu options that enable users to 
 select the queues they want to display in the Queue Manager window and 
 thus prevent large arrays causing timeouts or out of memory errors. Using 
 the new Queue Manager menu options, users can elect to display all queues 
 or a specific queue type. 
  
 Changes were made to the terminology of RAID and Magnetic storage to Tier 
 1 storage and the term Jukebox and Archive storage to Tier 2 storage.
  
 MAG*3.0*135 enables sites to configure the Tier 2 storage reserve. The 
 value of 5 percent is not configurable and not compatible with some of 
 the current storage technologies, Grid in particular.
  
 This patch resolves the issue related to transmitting the Monthly Site 
 Usage report, which some sites were experiencing. The method used to 
 generate the scheduled Imaging Monthly Site Usage report was revised. 
  
 MAG*3.0*135 provides support for Windows 2008 Server. The installation 
 program of the storage applications sets the menu options and shortcuts 
 of the storage applications to run in administrator mode. The storage 
 applications must run in administrator mode on Windows 2008 so they can 
 have read/write/delete access to the storage shares.
  
 The BP Verifier can now be used to recover Tier 1 storage network 
 references. The site can restore a RAID share by way of a backup tape or 
 Robocopy, set the Current Tier 1 Write location to that  share, and run 
 the BP verifier over a broad enough Image IEN range to include the images 
 on that share.
  
 MAG*3.0*135 now enables sites to manage the Purge Retention days for 
 Advanced Directives in addition to Photo IDs.
  
 MAG*3.0*135 provides an Archive Appliance (AA) Offline Platter utility, 
 which is used for processing of offline platter reports and updating the 
 VistA database. The AA Offline Platter utility enables the tracking of 
 images that are stored on platters that have been removed from the 
 jukebox, or when platters are re-introduced to the jukebox inventory.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ===========================
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Tickets:
  
 1. 496758 - Automatic login fails at consolidated sites
  
 Problem
 =======
 Auto-logins and Scheduled BP Verifiers are not functioning at consolidated
 sites.  The access and verify codes used for automatic logins are stored
 in these fields of the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS file (#2006.1): DICOM
 GATEWAY ACCESS CODE (#2006.1, 124) and DICOM GATEWAY VERIFY CODE (#2006.1,
 125). Editing the values of the access and verify codes for the service
 account for one site, updates the values for the service accounts of all
 sites. As a result, when there is a host or network failure, the automatic
 logins fail and the BP requires manual intervention.
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch resolves the issue by modifying the data dictionary, input 
 transformation of the IMAGING SITE PARAMETERS file (#2006.1) to ensure 
 that that editing the values of one service account does not update the 
 values of all service accounts. 
  
 2. 511475  Photo IDs were purged as if they are full diagnostic or 
    administrative images
  
 Problem 
 =======
 The BP Purge application only recognizes one of the two ways in which the 
 database identifies patient photos. This resulted in photos being purged 
 incorrectly.
  
 Resolution 
 ==========
 This version recognizes both ways in which the database identifies 
 patient photos
  
 3. 501172, 505170, 527346, 601767, 615316, 619086 - The BP Queue
    Management does not load when the volume of data in the queues is 
    large
  
 Problem
 =======
 When queue counts exceed a certain threshold, the Queue Manager times out 
 before displaying the queues. If a failed queue falls behind, the 
 operator has no access to any queues, including the failed Import queues, 
 to identify the problems and re-queue the failed studies. 
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch resolves the issue by modifying the interface to the Queue 
 Manager to load the Queue Manager Tree view incrementally rather than all 
 at once to prevent memory errors and timeouts. It also provides a submenu 
 that enables operators to display individual queue types, such as the 
 Import queue, preventing Queue Manager timeouts when the queue counts 
 exceed the threshold.
  
 4. 501706, 592201, 592407 - Queue counts go negative or will not
    decrement
  
 Problem
 =======
 The operator needs to use the Refresh Queue Counts menu option to 
 re-synchronize the queue counts as the software does not accurately 
 decrement the EVAL queues or the JUKEBOX queues. This results in false 
 positives in the automated mail alert subsystem.  Having a system that 
 broadcasts false positives for queue counts effectively disables the 
 messaging system.
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch resolves the problem by revising the JUKEBOX and EVAL de-queue 
 code so that the decrement is accurate.
  
 5. 504648, 623042, 623676, 624452, 624495, 625355, 625368, 626184 - Import
    OCX raises an error when the BP has an extended I/O event
  
 Problem
 =======
 The OCX has a separate Broker session that is not supported by periodic 
 RPC calls. The timeouts result in the BP stopping and critical processing 
 of iMED consents.
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch resolves the problem by revising the OCX so it uses the same 
 broker session that the BP allocation uses. It also implements error 
 trapping, logging, and auto-connect in conjunction with all I/O calls.
  
 6. 609411,757628,757632,757645,757706,757790,757895,758508,758733,758796,
    759263,760520,761798,764979 - Problems transmitting the Monthly Site
    Usage Report (MAG Enterprise issue with the Background Processor
    routine MAGQBUT1)
  
 Problem
 =======
 When the name of the site in the INSTITUTION file (#4) exceeds 22 
 characters, the Subject heading of the scheduled Imaging Monthly Site 
 Usage Report exceeds 60 characters and the report cannot be transmitted.
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch resolves the problem. The method used to generate the 
 scheduled Imaging Monthly Site Usage report was revised. It now allows 
 only 60 characters in the Subject heading of the report.
  
 7. 709354, 709367, 745160, 758077, 794927 - AA Offline Platter Reports
  
 Problem
 =======
 Sites using the new archive appliances (AA) that run on the ASTI/Plasmon 
 Archive Appliance (PAA) system needed a utility to track the platter 
 status of images on platters that were removed from the Jukebox. The Mag 
 Utility 'Offline Jukebox Images', which provides this functionality for 
 older model jukeboxes, can only be used with the report format from the 
 DiskXtender jukebox management (DEX) system and not with the PAA system.
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 The AA Offline Platter utility, which is distributed with this patch, 
 enables sites to utilize the archive appliances platter reports to track 
 the status of images located on platters that were removed from the 
 Jukebox. The utility updates the platter status of the image files in the 
 VistA database. For more information about the utility, see the section 
 AA Offline Platter Utility.
  
 8. 781887, 795508, 801936 - Issues when watermarking images for Rescinded 
    Advance Directive
  
 Problem
 =======
 When creating a new watermarked image for a Rescinded Advance Directive, 
 the incorrect date was used as the value for PROCEDURE/EXAM DATE TIME 
 field (#15).
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 The issue was due to an error when the Import API created a new image 
 entry. The Import API put a date in the PROCEDURE/EXAM DATE TIME field 
 (#15) of the IMAGE File (#2005). For Rescinded Advance Directives the 
 Import API incorrectly used the value of the ENTRY DATE/TIME field 
 (#1201) instead of the value from the REFERENCE DATE field (#1301). This 
 patch resolves the issue.
  
 9. 823711 - Enhancement related to Advance Directives being taken off-line
  
 Problem
 =======
 Advance Directive image files were not immediately and readily available 
 when the platters on which they were stored were taken off-line to free 
 more space. 
  
 Resolution
 ==========
 This patch cannot resolve the need for sites take Tier 2 storage platters 
 off-line when Tier 2 storage is needed for newly acquired images. Sites 
 can manage the Purge Retention days with this patch and it is recommended 
 that sites change the retention days for Photo IDs and Advanced 
 Directives to a minimum of 10 years (3650 days). Sites will continue to 
 be able to refresh Tier 1 storage and keep the Advanced Directives 
 available through this configuration addition. See Purge Parameter 
 Retention days and how it Applies to Advance Directives in the VistA 
 Imaging Background Processor User Manual.
  
 Installation
 ============
  
 This patch is to be installed on the VistA System and on the servers 
 running the Background Processor (BP) Queue Processor.
