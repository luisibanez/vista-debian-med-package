Subject: Watermarking Rescinded Advance Directives

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This document describes Patch 121, the Watermarking Rescinded Advance 
 Directives patch. This patch facilitates watermarking an image or group 
 of images as "Rescinded  when the associated Advanced Directive is 
 rescinded from the Text Integrated Utility (TIU). Major changes and
 detailed information are in the MAG3_0P121_Patch_Descrtion document.
  
 Patch 121 allows for the watermarking of images associated with an advance
 directive that has been rescinded by the patient. When a note title is 
 changed in TIU from Advance Directive to Rescinded Advance Directive, the 
 TIU application will call a new Imaging  M  API to Rescind the associated 
 Image. After the process is complete, all images associated with the 
 rescinded advance directive will be watermarked "Rescinded  and a 
 confirmation email will be sent to the subscribers of G.MAG SERVER mail 
 group with the status of the watermarking.
  
 The image associated with the advance directive is marked deleted and a 
 copy of the original image with the watermark "Rescinded  is made 
 available to Clinical Display users.
  
 NOTE    Patch TIU*1.0*261 is needed to rescind advance directives.
