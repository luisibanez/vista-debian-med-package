Subject: CLINICAL CAPTURE ACCUSOFT VERSION UPDATE MAINTENANCE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This document describes MAG*3.0*129, the VistA Imaging Accusoft Version Update
 Maintenance patch for VistA Imaging (VI) Clinical Capture. 
  
 The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) is
 an enterprise-wide information system built around an Electronic Health Record
 (EHR), used throughout the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
 medical system, known as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). About a
 quarter of the nation's population is potentially eligible for VA benefits and
 services because they are veterans, family members or survivors of veterans. By
 providing electronic health records capability, VistA is thereby one of the
 most widely used EHRs in the world.
  
 MAG*3.0*129  upgrades the Clinical Capture application to the latest version of
 the Accusoft ImageGear components. Accusoft ImageGear is a commercial product
 used by VI for viewing and manipulation of the images being captured and
 displayed.
  
 Features and fixes of MAG*3.0*129 are summarized below. 
  
 *  This patch updates the Accusoft version of Clinical Capture to 16.2.11, the 
    latest released version, and the same version as Clinical Display.
  
 *  Clinical Capture code developed to view and manipulate images using the 
    older Accusoft Control IG99 is removed. The code and controls created for
    Clinical Display will be reused in Clinical Capture. 
        
 *  The user will be able to display more image types in the capture window than 
    previously supported, and will not have to use Alternate Viewers as much.
        
 *  Clinical Capture annotation functionality is upgraded to the same 
    annotation functionality in Clinical Display, including the floating 
    annotation toolbar.
        
 *  Clinical Capture now implements the CCOW standard using the Sentillion
    Vergence Contextor. This enables Clinical Capture to stay in Patient Context
    with other desktop applications that implement CCOW, most notably Clinical
    Display and CPRS.
        
 *  Prevent users from creating an addendum to an addendum. 
        
 *  Provides a new user preference that will allow for the column sizes in the 
    progress note listing window to be saved as a user preference.
        
 *  Corrected an issue which caused the application to time out when attempting 
    to view TIU notes for a patient. The application will maintain the
    ability to view all notes for the patient, however it will now display up to
    100 notes at a time. The user will be prompted to select next.
        
 *  Corrects the ability for Free Text Input when using the Clinical Capture 
    application.
        
 *  Allows for the MultiPg Doc option to remain checked when scanning only a 
    single page.
  
 During the installation of MAG*3.0*129, the configuration file (.ini) settings
 from mag308.ini will be retained in the new mag.ini file. 
  
 The capture function of Clinical Capture uses Accusoft to display images.
 Images that are not viewable using Accusoft controls will continue to be
 viewable in alternate viewers. In the case of non-visual objects such as wav
 files, they will be continue to be run/played in the application that is
 associated with the file format through the operating system.
  
 Previous releases have included three client applications in one installation: 
 Clinical Capture, Clinical Display, and Telereader. 
  
 MAG*3.0*129 contains only the Clinical Capture application.

 Remedy Calls:
 =============
  
 Ticket:  #454036  
 Problem: Clinical Capture does not maintain Patient context with CPRS when
 launch from the CPRS application. Users are given the option to not synchronize
 with patient in CPRS when Clinical Capture is called from CPRS through the
 "Imaging<->CPRS Link" window. Resynchronizing requires restarting Clinical
 Capture. Starting Clinical Capture from the desktop allows patient selection so
 the option is not necessary and can lead to linking images to the wrong
 patient. 
  
 Solution:  Clinical Capture now implements the CCOW standard using the
 Sentillion Vergence Contextor. This enables Clinical Capture to stay in Patient
 Context with other desktop applications that implement CCOW, most notably
 Clinical Display and CPRS.
  
 Ticket:  #405910,534317,599111 
 Problem: When a progress note is completed and an addendum is added, users are
 then allowed to add an addendum to that already completed addendum. This
 function is not permitted in CPRS and therefore should not be allowed within
 Clinical Capture. 
  
 Solution :  Remove the ability for a user to create an addendum to an addendum
 by removing the option from the GUI.
  
 Ticket   #240892  
 Problem: Users requested the ability to save their column widths on the
 Progress Notes window in their user preferences. 
  
 Solution: Allow for column sizes in the Progress Note listing window to be
 saved as a user preference.
  
 Ticket:  #591246 
 Problems: Clinical Capture times out when displaying a patient record that may
 contain a long list of TIU notes.
  
 Solution:  Set the maximum number of notes to be displayed at 100 per each
 search. Users will maintain the ability to select as many notes to be displayed
 as they wish, however Clinical capture will only display a maximum of 100 at a
 time. When that number of notes has been displayed the user will be prompted to
 select  get "x" in order to view the remaining notes.  
  
 Ticket:  #583686
 Problems: Clinical Capture allows for free text to be entered in the DICOM
 Header Data Entry drop down screen. 
  
 Solution: Remove the ability to enter free text into those fields. A user must
 now select an pre-set option (Right, Left, Unpaired, Both Left and Right) from
 the drop down or leave that field blank. 
  
 New Service Requests:
 =====================
  
 There are no new Service Requests associated with this patch.
  
 Patient Safety Issues:
 ======================
  
 Patient Safety Issue (PSI) report 1948 regarding VistA Imaging Capture and CCOW
 is associated with this patch.
  
 MAG*3.0*129 Changes:
 ==================== 
  
 Summary:
  
 The release of MAG*3.0*129 will maintain all the current functionality of
 Clinical Capture. Enhancements to Clinical Capture will include the capability
 of viewing file formats such as PDF, DICOM, text, and TGA using the capture
 window and the Accusoft display control. The Annotation support in Clinical
 Capture will be modified to use the Annotation toolbar developed in MAG*3.0*122
 for Clinical Display. This patch features a CCOW component that will allow
 users of the Clinical Capture application to maintain patient context with CPRS
 and Clinical Display. The use of this software without CCOW may requires the
 user to closely monitor the patient identity. We recommend the use of CCOW to
 minimize the possibility of human error leading to incorrect identification of
 the patient.
  
 Clinical Capture Changes:
 =========================
  
 Configuration File Changes:
  
 Clinical Capture supports both Windows 7 and Windows XP operating systems (OS). 
 MAG*3.0*129 copies the mag308.ini configurations to the mag.ini file. 
  
 The patch places mag.ini in:
  
 Windows XP: C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\Vista\Imaging
  
 Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\VistA\Imaging
  
 NOTE: With the installation of MAG*3.0*129 all previous configuration settings
       for Clinical Capture, Clinical Display, and Telereader (if applicable) 
       from mag308.ini will be retained during the installation of mag.ini. 
  
 The business process for capturing images using Clinical Capture will not
 change in MAG*3.0*129. 
  
 Upgrade to Accusoft version 16.2.11:
  
 When the application is upgraded to the latest version of Accusoft controls the
 complexity of maintaining the applications is  greatly reduced. The
 applications are easier to maintain by having only one set of functions for the
 display and manipulation of images in Clinical Display and Clinical Capture;
 and only one set of functions for the annotation of images in Clinical Display
 and Clinical Capture.
  
 The ability to view images in the Clinical Capture application rather than an
 alternate viewer increases the usability of the application, and the capability
 to capture images in Adobe PDF format is enabled by this latest version of
 controls. Future enhancements of TWAIN Device capabilities in Clinical Capture
 will be enabled because the newer version of Accusoft controls support the
 latest version of the TWAIN interface.
  
 Enhancements for Displaying Progress Notes:
  
 Clinical Capture has enhancements for displaying and viewing progress notes. 
 These include an update that will allow for a user to load 'more' progress
 notes correcting an issue that would cause the application to time out at the
 time of retrieval and an updated split screen for displaying unsigned notes
 that are maintained in separate lists.  
  
 Annotations Tool Bar:
  
 The controls used in the functionality of the application are being upgraded,
 including the Annotations toolbar which will be replaced by the one used in 
 Clinical Display.
  
 CCOW Implementation:
  
 With the release of MAG*3.0*129, a user will have the ability to directly
 utilize the CCOW functionalities within the Clinical Capture application and
 will provide the following functionalities:
        
      *  Clinical Capture will maintain patient context and listen for user 
         change messages in Display and CPRS.
        
      * Clinical Capture now has the ability to be launched from CPRS and join
        CCOW when the same patient has been selected remains context.

 MAG*3.0*122 is the last Imaging Patch that included all three Clinical GUI
 applications: Clinical Capture, Clinical Display , and Telereader. 
  
 After MAG*3.0*122, patches may or may not have all three applications
 included. As a result of this change in the distribution of Clinical GUI
 applications, the version of each of the three applications that in installed
 on a workstation may be different.
  
 MAG*3.0*129 only includes Clinical Capture, so after installing MAG*3.0*129,
 the workstation will have:
  
 Clinical Capture       Version 3.0 Patch 129
  
 Clinical Display       Version 3.0 Patch 122
  
 Telereader             Version 3.0 Patch 122
  
 The user will see what applications are included in the build when they run the
 install. 
  
 For example : 
  
      * For MAG*3.0*122, the Installation Message Window included the phrase :
        'This will install Clinical Display, Clinical Capture and Telereader..'
        
      *  For MAG*3.0*129, the Installation Message Window includes the phrase :
         'This will install the Clinical Capture application..'
  
 This patch must be installed by the compliance date to conform with VHA
 Directive 2001-023.
  
 This patch may be loaded while users are on the system. Installation will take
 less than one minute.
