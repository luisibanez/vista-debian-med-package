Description:
============

 MAG*3.0*131 Clinical Display Scout Lines Enhancement introduces new
 features to the VistA Imaging Clinical Display.
  
 MAG*3.0*131 contains the following new functions:
  
 - Clinical Display will calculate and display Scout lines on CT and MR
   images in the Radiology viewer. 
 - Scout lines can be displayed for CT and MR studies from remote VA sites
   and from the Department of Defense (DoD).
 - The Radiology viewer will automatically display cross referencing slice
   line indicators on orthogonal views of MR and CT image sets that are
   concurrently displayed. 
 - Scout lines can be hidden by the user. 
 - Image orientation indicators are shown in the scout window.
 - The user can designate an image as a scout image from within the 
   radiology viewer.
 - The user can remove an image from the scout window.
 - The scout viewer will have all the image manipulation functions 
   currently available in the Radiology viewer. 
 - User can configure the scout line color to Blue, Red, Green or Yellow.
 - Indicator lines will be displayed on the scout image for the first and
   last image in the series to indicate the range of scout lines.
 - Users can view images in two windows in the Radiology Viewer with the
   location of the selected image displayed as a scout line superimposed 
   on the scout image where they intersect the scout image.
 - When the user selects a location in the scout image,  the viewer 
   containing the associated stack will display the selected or the nearest
   slice image.
  
 MAG*3.0*131 addresses the following issues that were reported in the 
 Remedy Action Request System for the Clinical Display application.
  
 - Allows a user to view 24-bit full color images in red, green, blue
   channels in both the Full Resolution and Radiology viewers.
 - Corrects an issue that prevents printing a DICOM encapsulated PDF.
 - Provides a description when an image has no associated user field in the
   QA Review Report function.
 - Corrects an issue with viewing a study image in the radiology viewer.
 - Removes the hidden modal window when a patient does not have radiology
   images to be displayed.
 - Corrects an issue that caused certain DICOM images to be distorted.
 - Support displaying of images from the Muse EKG system for Indian Health
   Services.

 Remedy Help Calls:
 ==================
  
 1. 369949
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 In QA Review report, all the images that are not associated with a user
 have <empty> in the user column. 
  
 Solution:
 ========= 
 Replaced <empty> with <undefined>.
  
 2. 438339
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When viewing a group of images in Clinical Display radiology viewer the
 last viewed image is displayed instead of the group abstract. 
  
 Solution:  
 =========
 When a user double clicks an item in the image list, the group abstract
 will be displayed. 
  
 3. 598729
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 Clinical Display renders certain DICOM images incorrectly. The images look
 square and are distorted. 
  
 Solution:
 ========= 
 A change to the resolution update for the image corrects this issue and
 allows for the image to be viewed properly. 
  
 4. 713689 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A full color 24-bit image can reveal different diagnostic information 
 when cycling between the individual color channels. Currently only the 
 composite full-color image is displayed. 
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 MAG*3.0*131 provides a new button on the image toolbar and a new menu on 
 the image menu that permits the user to cycle through an image's color 
 channels when the image is a 24-bit color image. These options are 
 available in both the Clinical Display Full Resolution Viewer and the 
 Clinical Display Radiology Viewer.
  
 5. 726792 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When selecting individual images to ROI print, sometimes not all images 
 display a checkbox. Also, the user reported that color ROI printouts come 
 out in black and white.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Clinical Display now displays the checkboxes in the Image List when ROI 
 Choose Images to Print is selected. The checkboxes refresh when a new 
 patient is selected and also when image filters are selected. Clinical 
 Display ROI, when printing to paper does print in color when a valid 
 color printer is selected and when the color printer driver is installed 
 and operational on the user's computer.
  
 6. 815885
  
 Problem:
 ======== 
 Clinical Display can display DICOM encapsulated PDFs but when the user
 prints, only the print headers are printed.
  
 Resolution:
 =========== 
 The images will be rasterized so that the PDF can be properly printed.
