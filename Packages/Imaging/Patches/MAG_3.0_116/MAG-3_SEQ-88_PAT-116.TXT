Subject: QUERY RETRIEVE PROVIDER II

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 MAG*3.0*116, the DICOM Query/Retrieve Provider II patch enhances
 MAG*3.0*66 Query/Retrieve Provider by enabling the Query/Retrieve
 application to access the new data structures introduced with the release
 of MAG*3.0*34 and to retrieve the new SOP class objects for which support
 was introduced in MAG*3.0*34.
  
 MAG*3.0*116 has enhanced logging, which ensures an adequate audit trail 
 that meets the VA 6500 audit logging security requirements when records
 are accessed through a query/retrieve request.
  
 The Query/Retrieve application in MAG*3.0*116 provides these features and 
 benefits:
  
 - The capability to query and retrieve any stored SOP classes. However, in
 MAG*3.0*34, the system default is to not store new SOP classes.
  
 - Runs as a service on the Hybrid DICOM Image Gateway (HDIG).
  
 - Supports enhanced logging in compliance with the recommendations 
   of the audit requirements that were made for MAG*3.0*66
   * Logs all system level events in a new Audit log
   * Logs all application level events in the Application log
   * Logs all warnings and errors in the ImagingExchangeWebApp.log
   * Logs all Query/Retrieve requests to access sensitive patient records
     in the VistA Sensitive Patient Log, the DICOM service account
     information when logging entries.

 Associated Patches
 ==================
 All released VistA Imaging patches are required and must be installed on 
 the VistA system before MAG*3.0*116 can be installed. The KIDS files 
 should be installed on the VistA system host in this order: 
     
     MAG*3.0*49
     MAG*3.0*34
  
 For a list of all released Imaging (MAG) patches, refer to the 
 patch_list.txt file, which is available on the Imaging FTP server. To 
 locate the file, go to ftp://ftp.imaging.domain.ext. Then, navigate to 
 the \Docs\Imaging_Docs_Latest folder.

 Remedy Calls
 ============
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy help desk calls:
  
 1. 463208- RF Multiframe images failed on the C-MOVE operation
  
 Problem:
 ========
 RF Multiframe images failed on the C-MOVE operation.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Resolved in MAG*3.0*116 for old studies stored in a TGA format.  As of 
 MAG*3.0*99, RF images should be stored as DICOM, which eliminates the 
 problem.
  
 2. 475747- Vista IMAGING - Error message displays after clicking 
 START QR
  
 Problem:
 ========
 In setting up QR for DICOM gateway, page 194 of DICOM Gateway User Manual 
 states after all the configurations, then an ACCESS/VERIFY logon prompt 
 should appear when clicking START QR. A flash error message displays then 
 the windows close.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 In MAG*3.0*116, Q/R starts as a service on the HDIG automatically. The 
 login screen is no longer needed.
  
 3. 488623- Multiple modality tags on Muskogee priors (sending to NTP).
  
 Problem:
 ========
 There is an odd behavior with some older Muskogee cases. The studies are 
 being received with multiple values in the DICOM modality tag (0008,0060) 
 of CR\DX\RF, but the SOP Class UID is CR, which corresponds to how it is 
 acquired. An unnecessary check/modification by the Q/R application maybe 
 occurring. On the outbound reconstruction of the DICOM object, the 
 software is checking the RAD/NUC Med Procedure file (#71) for modality 
 code(s) for a given procedure. If that procedure has multiple modality 
 codes (which is common), then the application sends everything it finds. 
 This is illegal according to the DICOM standard (0008, 0060 has a VM=1). 
 Downstream this is causing issues with the vendor and their hanging 
 protocols. The vendor's application is seeing the discrepancy between the 
 SOP Class UID and the modality codes, and trying to correct by deeming 
 the image as a Secondary Capture.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Only a single value is returned for the Modality Code, as expected by the 
 DICOM Standard.
  
 4. 584576 - Receiving multiple tags on images and multiple values in 
 the modality tags
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Receiving multiple tags on images. We are sending stat studies to a NTP 
 site after hours and they are reporting that they are receiving SC 
 modality types. They are also receiving images with multiple values in 
 the modality tag.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Only a single value is returned for the Modality Code, as expected by the 
 DICOM Standard.
