Description:
============

 The DICOM Importer will enhance the automation of importing DICOM objects
 from outside facilities streamlining the reconciliation of patient
 demographic and imaging study data between outside imaging facilities , 
 including the Department of Defense (DoD), and systems of the Department 
 of Veterans Affairs (VA).
  
 The VA is faced with the on-going problem of having to import into VistA and 
 commercial PACS increasing numbers of outside DICOM studies.  Current estimates
 are that that sites may import up to 500 studies per week. These studies come 
 from multiple sources:
  
   - VA Polytrauma Centers where critically wounded service personal are 
     transitioning from intensive care DoD facilities to the VA.  
   - Veterans serviced by other federal facilities (DoD, Indian Health 
     Services)
   - Walk-in patients with media (CDs/DVDs) containing imaging studies.  
   - Images from outside facilities for contracted studies.
  
 MAG*3.0*118 includes the DICOM Importer II, which provides the ability to:
   - Import DICOM objects from an Integrated Health Enterprise (IHE)
     Portable Data for Imaging compliant storage media (CD). 
   - Import of DICOM objects from a network DICOM proxy server.
  
 The DICOM Importer II:
   - Introduces a centralized work queue for staging studies copied from
     media or received through a network proxy and provides users with a 
     graphical user interface (GUI) for reconciling the studies with
     orders.
   - Introduces a centralized work queue for studies requiring corrections
     (DICOM Correct) and provides users with a graphical user interface
     (GUI) for making the corrections.
   - Provides better tracking of patient information though enhancements to
     the reporting of statistical information.
   - Includes enhanced security mechanisms providing several levels of user
     access to the import and reporting functionality.
  
 MAG*3.0*118 implements enterprise-level audit logging consistent with the 
 VA 6500.C Security Handbook. It uses the mechanisms introduced in 
 MAG*3.0*116 to capture system level Audit logging.

 Remedy Help Calls:
 ==================
  
 1. 134667 - Cancel case image cannot be deleted
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Site reports he has images waiting to be processed in 
 the PACs system, but the case number has been cancelled. There are 183 
 images in cancelled case #022306-798. This may be a looping issue in the 
 DICOM Correct process.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
     
 2. 183828 - VistA Imaging not processing images
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Site said that a particular patient had a hyphenated name that was 
 causing the process window to loop. File 2006.575 was checked and 390,000 
 entries were found for that one machine. User killed them all off in a 
 programming loop and re-indexed the file. User tried to resend the old 
 images but they failed with an error of no error.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 3. 185660 - Corrected image not processing on DICOM gateway
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Validated corrected images and error out at MAGD 
 (2006.575,132921,"RLATE").
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 4. 186403 - 68 studies to be corrected not in DICOM Correct
  
 Problem:
 ========
 This is another of those out of control fix loops on the 2_3 process 
 window. File 2006.575 was over 1,000,000. There were about 40 images with 
 over 30,000 images each in file 2006.575. User cleaned those out and did 
 a resend of the 9.000 images in the image in folder, but it kept looping 
 again. User ended up having to clean out all the images for Machine ID 
 "C". Then, after re-indexing and running option 12 it started to work 
 properly. Had to resend the images all over again, and reset the listener 
 port, but now it is resending and the numbers on the failed images jive.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 5. 186942 - DICOM Image Gateway caught in loop
  
 Problem:
 ========
 HDIG is stuck in a processing loop. Looked like it was a consult that 
 was using Radiology. Cleaned up file 2006.575 and started things back up. 
 User did have some problems trying to resend the images that were in 
 2006.575 on this machine. The resend failed repeatedly. Site POC said 
 these were archive images that Echo was trying to send and that they may 
 have issues. She did not think they were crucial at this time and they 
 could work on them later.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 6. 188633 - Process job stuck in a loop on DICOM fix
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Site found the process window looping on a set of images. By the time 
 user got in to VistA it was at 120,000 images, 99% from one machine id. A 
 delete loop was run in Fileman to clean up the images and restarted the 
 processing window. User was not able to resend images. This time the 
 issue was due to Radiology attaching the images to a cancelled study.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 7. 189963 - Image processing stuck in a loop
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Images sent from Echocardiogram using the consult process are causing the 
 Imaging processor to loop. This is the 3rd time images that were attached 
 to a cancelled consult have caused this problem.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 8. 193044 - DICOM FIX problem
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Previous problem where the entries with bad case number go into a loop 
 for DICOM fix even though they do not show up in DICOM Fix for users to 
 correct. They apparently resent the images for a patient with a bad case 
 number on purpose to get them through. Now we have approximately 620400+ 
 entries in file 2006.575.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 9. 213872 - Image process window in a DICOM fix loop
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Site had run into another of those Dicom Fix loops. This time the POC 
 caught when it had put over 12,000,000 entries in file 2006.575. Site had 
 to kill the global completely. There was no way to let Fileman clean them 
 up. Dig2 had 10,000 old images in the Image_in. Moved out about 4,000 
 that were from 2006 and moved the rest into a separate folder and did a 
 resend.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 10. 215075 - DICOM Gateway stuck in loop again
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Images sent from Echocardiogram using the consult process are causing the 
 Imaging processor to loop. This is the 4th or 5th time images that were 
 attached to a cancelled consult have caused this problem.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 11. 275712 - Vista Imaging - DICOM Gateway trying to process 
 "Cancelled" exam images
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Accidently put images to "Cancelled" consult (through Dicom Menu Option, 
 Correct Clinical Studies) and the Gateway is stuck on trying to process 
 these repeatedly. There are several other DICOM modalities on this 
 gateway and nothing else is getting through.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM Correct 
 is no longer used.
  
 12. 404101 - Outside studies in as problem images for MAG*3.0*99
  
 Problem:
 ========
 DICOM Correct (delete of these images) resulted in problems. The vendor 
 supplied fee'd studies back to site via CD. The study used was a CR CXR 
 with an OA and Lat view AND another image. This image was created by the 
 outside modality as a DICOM image but it appears to be their report. It 
 doesn't appear to be CR, SC, encapsulated PDF or any other real modality 
 format. 1) If that image comes across first the old DICOM correct 
 (delete) function doesn't delete it or any images that came in behind it; 
 and 2) If the image comes in last then old DICOM correct (delete) will 
 delete everything but the aptly named "***_problem_image.DCM".
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Vendor media data problem. Media (data) is no longer available to 
 determine issue. However, MAG*3.0*118 is much more robust to handle 
 invalid media.
  
 13. 477443 - MAG*3.0*53/ MAG*3.0*99 DICOM Importer error on CD
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The study errors from CD and if transmitted to gateway. User uploaded the 
 entire CD contents to: /software/sites/fayetteville_nc/P53-99errorCD in 
 the FNC site folder. The error is: 
 Ready to import the DICOM objects? n // y

 14. 490431 - STUDY TIME missing
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Studies were not imported in MAG*3.0*53 when the STUDY TIME was missing 
 (the processing failed).  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 If a missing study time is encountered in the DICOM header during import, 
 the STUDY TIME field defaults to one minute after midnight. 
  
 15. 499196 - Vista Imaging - MAG*3.0*53 error
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When using Importer (MAG*3.0*53) on a DICOM gateway, whenever there is a 
 study that has a time just in seconds after midnight (1 to 59 seconds 
 after midnight), the following error happens: Error in RPC RAMAG EXAM 
 REGISTER 11^2 11^Invalid parameter(s).^VALIDATE+101~RAMAG03A^3  
 3^Parameter 'RADTE' has an invalid value. ^VALIDATE+29~RAMAG03A^E Message 
 generated at MUMPS line tag REGISTER+33^MAGDAIR5. This happens 
 consistently when the time has not reached 1 minute after midnight.  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Time issue was resolved to properly handle improperly formatted date/time 
 data. 
  
 16. 538939 - Errors importing images from CD/DVD
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Errors importing images from CD/DVD.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*118 performs enhanced media validation prior to import.
  
 17. 555094 - DICOM FAILED IMAGES file (#2006.575) overflow
  
 Problem:
 ========
 DICOM Correct errors and file overflow errors occur when performing 
 legacy DICOM Correct on a single study sent from two sources and 
 attempting to delete the study from DICOM Correct. The issue may also 
 occur with a canceled study in the DICOM Delete queue that receives 
 images. Such conditions can send the software into a loop and fill the 
 DICOM FAILED IMAGES file (#2006.575).
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118. Legacy DICOM 
 Correct is no longer used.
  
 18. 573524 - Could not load images using importer. Receive error
  
 Problem:
 ========
 DICOM Processing 2-3 errors discovered in testing of MAG*3.0*34/ 
 MAG*3.0*116 are evidently inherent to DICOM Correct coding issues that 
 have been present since Imaging MAG*3.0*11. Root cause appears to be the 
 inconsistent utilization of the "AFX" cross reference, referring to Tier 
 3 Development to be addressed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The DICOM Correct process was changed with MAG*3.0*118.  Legacy DICOM 
 Correct is no longer used.
  
 19. 591243 - Could not load images using importer. Receive error
  
 Problem:
 ========
 This error is being caused by provider, causing invalid parameter in the 
 order file "-3^Parameter 'REQPHYS' has an invalid value. 
 ^VALIDATE=166RAMAG02A6E^REQPHYS=`91578' Message generated at MUMPS line 
 tag ORDER+29^MAGDAIR5.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*118 performs enhanced media validation prior to import.
  
 20. 600280 - Images don't show in Display and Error with Correct 
 Option
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Radiology imported an MRI from a CD. The report the Importer created can 
 be seen in CPRS. However, there's no image icon next to it and nothing in 
 Imaging Display. Attempted to use the 'Correct local studies...' option 
 and receive an error. <UNDEFINED>GETDATA+12^MAGDAIRD In looking at the 
 error, the patient it errors on has no images in the IMAGE_IN folder and 
 isn't in the DICOM FAILED file. Unsupported SOP instance (enhanced MR) 
 was imported into the 2005 structure. When Clinical Display attempted to 
 view it, an error occurred.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*34 resolves this issue by accepting those new SOP classes, and 
 putting them in the new data structure. Therefore, clinical display 
 doesn't currently see them. This was not an explicit fix of the bug. It 
 was a side-effect of MAG*3.0*34 supporting new SOP classes.
  
 21. 626432 - Test site attempted to install MAG*3.0*118-T24 prior to 
 removing entries to file #2006.575
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Test site attempted to install MAG*3.0*118-T24 prior to removing entries 
 to file #2006.575.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 MAG*3.0*118 KIDS includes a pre-environment check to ensure no entries 
 exist in #2006.575 and will not allow install if entries exist.
