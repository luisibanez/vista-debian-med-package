Subject: VISTARAD MAINTENANCE VIII

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 MAG*3.0*133 VistARad Maintanence VII will address maintenance items and  
 Remedy tickets that were reported in the Remedy Action Request system.
  
 MAG*3.0*133 addresses the following issues:
  - Memory Leak issue when accessing certain exams
  - Fixes a hanging protocol issue when opening certain XA studies
  - For Indian Health Services only: corrects the display of the 
    medical record number and patient age when displayed on the VistARad 
    title bars. 
  - Provides a user preference to display larger thumbnails on the 
    Preview window and re-formats the Preview window display
  - Provides a feature that allows a user to reset VistARad windows 
    positions 
  - Hidden message box for VistA password expirations
  - Kodak (CareStream) CR images not opening properly due to a hanging
    protocol issue CT dose reports that do not render correctly if
    utilizing the old Group 6000 overlays
  - Images with VOI/LUT data fail to load when remotely accessed through
    the VIX.
  - Exams that include scanned documents (which do not load in 
    VistARad) now will provide explanatory information regarding the files 
    that do not load when accessed remotely via the VIX.
  
 NOTE    All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion 
 of this patch. At sites that have implemented VistARad, installation of 
 both the KIDS and the client software is required.  The MAG*3.0*133 KIDS 
 is backwards-compatible with the MAG*3.0*120 client software; 
 installation of the client software may be phased in according to each 
 site's needs.

 Associated Patches:
 ===================
 All released VistA Imaging patches are required and must be installed on 
 the VistA system before MAG*3.0*133 can be installed. The KIDS files of 
 the following VistA Imaging patches must be installed on the VistA system 
 in this order:
  
   MAG*3.0*120
  
 For a list of all released Imaging (MAG) patches, refer to the 
 patch_list.txt file, which is available on the Imaging FTP server. To 
 locate the file, go to ftp://ftp.imaging.domain.ext. Then, navigate to 
 the \Docs\Imaging_Docs_Latest folder.

 Remedy Help Calls:
 ==================
  
 1. 207691, 590741, 601910, 605562, 614787 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 CT dose report images do not render when using the old version Group 6000 
 overlays.
  
 Resolution:
 ==========
 The program was modified to be able to manage and display both old and 
 new versions of Group 6000 overlay data.
  
 2. 385648 
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Thumbnail images on the Preview window are too small.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The default size for the thumbnail image on the Preview window's list 
 view was increased.  In addition, a user preference was created to allow 
 each user to select from a choice of larger sizes that are now available.
  
 3. 419152, 535982, 600443
  
 Problem:
 ========
 VistARad is failing to open all images from an XA study due to an issue 
 with the XA hanging protocol when both single-frame and multi-frame image 
 objects exist in the study.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The program's hanging protocol processing logic was fixed to correctly 
 manage studies having interleaved multi-frame and single frame images.
  
 4. 518326, 713116, 784423, 712501
  
 Problem:
 ========
 When opening images from certain  Kodak (CareStream) CR modality 
 versions, the images are not correctly grouped in the display viewports.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The program was modified to prevent identifying these images as scout 
 images so that the images would be grouped appropriately.
  
 5. 613696
  
 Problem:
 ========
 A memory leak occurs when loading images having VOI/LUTs.  This may lead 
 to a crash after loading numerous such exams during a reading session.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The program was modified to eliminate the memory leak.
  
 6. 709885
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Sometimes the remembered screen position for certain of VistARad's 
 ancillary windows is lost, resulting in the window failing to display on 
 any of the available screens.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 A new menu option, Customize | Reset VistARad Windows, was created to 
 allow the user to restore all the ancillary windows to a default screen 
 position from which the user can re-position the windows to preferred 
 locations and sizes.
  
 7. 730931, 797181
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The VistARad client is improperly displaying patient demographic 
 information for IHS patients: the Medical Record Number (MRN) is 
 incorrectly formatted; and, patient age for patients born after 
 12/31/1999 is incorrect.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The program was modified to not always assume that a patient's 
 identifying number is a social security number so that the MRN can be 
 displayed without hyphens breaking it apart.  The logic for calculating 
 patient age was corrected to always use the four-digit year. 
  
 8. 754317
  
 Problem:
 ========
 VistARad is displaying some MR exams by breaking some series into 
 individual images.  This produces many extraneous thumbnail entries on 
 the Preview window. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The program was modified to prevent identifying these images as scout 
 images so that the images would be grouped appropriately, and not 
 generate extraneous thumbnails on the Preview window.
  
 9. 754321
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Contrast or dose fields are not visible when the radiologists pull up 
 orders in VistARad.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 When the radiologist displays the requisition or report, the medications 
 and radiopharmaceuticals dosing data are now displayed.
  
 10. 760101
  
 Problem:
 ========
 The Message box containing the VistA password expiration message is 
 hidden behind the Broker Login window. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 A program setting was changed so that when the message box is displayed 
 it is forced on top of any other window so a user will see it.
  
 11. 769112, 791998
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Images with VOI/LUT data fail to load when remotely accessed through the 
 VIX.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The image processing logic employed for remotely accessed images was 
 re-factored to unify it with the logic that is employed for locally 
 accessed images having VOI/LUT data.  This allowed the sequence of steps 
 for the loading and pre-processing logic to follow identical pathways 
 through the image retrieval operations for both local and remote images.
  
 12. 771016
  
 Problem:
 ========
 After opening remotely accessed exams that include scanned documents 
 (most of which are not supported by VistARad), a message window displays 
 stating that "some images failed to load".  This message is misleading, 
 since the actual images from the study do load correctly, and only the 
 scanned document(s) are not loaded.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The message box that is displayed now will provide explanatory 
 information regarding the files that do not load so that the clinician 
 can determine whether the failed objects may include images, or may be 
 scanned documents.  It further reminds the user that scanned documents 
 may be viewed in the VistA Imaging Display Client, if needed.
  
 Note: This new behavior will not occur until modifications to the VIX 
 software that are part of MAG*3.0*138 Telepathology Worklist, have been 
 installed.  However, the implementation is back-compatible with the 
 currently-deployed VIX software so that the existing functionality will 
 be observed until such time as the newer VIX version is deployed.

 be logged off the system during the KIDS install; non-radiologists need 
 not be logged off. The KIDS installation will take less than one minute.
  
 Installing the KIDS Package
  
 1  Access the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD MAIN].
 2  Run the Installation option [XPD INSTALLATION MENU].
 3  Load the KIDS file by performing the following steps.

      the patch is installed.  All components (routines, options, and so
      on) in the patch will be compared.
     Backup a Transport Global [XPD BACKUP] - run this option to create a 
      backup message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
      back up any of the other changes.
