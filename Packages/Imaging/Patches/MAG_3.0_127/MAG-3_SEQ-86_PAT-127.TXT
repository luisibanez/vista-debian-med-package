Description:
============

 MAG*3.0*127 Overview
  
 This document describes MAG*3.0*127, a TeleReader Maintenance patch. This 
 patch addresses application bugs that were noted in the Remedy Action 
 Request System, provides a mechanism for cloning user permissions, and 
 applies the upgrade necessary to ensure the TeleReader Configurator 
 application meets the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) 508 compliance 
 requirements. 
  
 Previous releases have included three client applications in one 
 installation:  Clinical Capture, Clinical Display, and TeleReader. 
 MAG*3.0*127 contains only the TeleReader and TeleReader Configurator 
 applications.
  
 MAG*3.0*127 is backward compatible with all previously released TeleReader 
 patches.
  
 Major changes are summarized below. For detailed information, refer to the 
 change summary section in the MAG*3.0*127 Patch Description. 
  
 MAG*3.0*127 contains the following new functions for the TeleReader
 Configurator:
  
 *  Provides a mechanism for cloning of a TeleReader user's profile, and 
 application of the cloned profile to new user profiles.
  
 MAG*3.0*127 corrects the following problems:
  
 *  Ensures the TeleReader Configurator is compliant with the requirements 
    specified in Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
  
 *  Corrects the locking of patient files when they are being accessed from 
    the TeleReader Worklist.
  
 *  Provides a comprehensive list of TIU notes titles in the TeleReader 
    Configurator. 
  
 *  Cross references data that was contained in the "AC" files as reported 
    in the Remedy Action Request System.
  
 *  Allows a user to select multiple procedures for any service.
  
 *  Allows for a duplication within the INSTIUTION file (#4) for sites with 
    the same name to occur without error.
  
 *  Provides the ability to identify a reading site in TeleReader when the
    reading site is not defined in the IMAGING USERS file (#2006.19).
  
 Note:  All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of 
        this patch. Installation of  both the KIDS and the client software is 
        required; installation of the client software may be phased in 
        according to each site's needs.

 Solution: TeleReader will now display the station number in the reading site 
           column. In the rare case when the station number is blank in the 
           INSTITUTION file (#4), the reading site will be identified by the 
           site IEN contained within parenthesis.

 Client Software Changes and New Features:
 =========================================
  
 Configuration File Changes:
 ===========================
  
 The TeleReader applications will now be supported on both Windows 7 and 
 Windows XP operating systems (OS).  MAG*3.0*127 renames the MAG308.ini 
 configuration file to MAG.ini. The patch places MAG.ini and 
 MagTeleReaderConfig.ini in the following locations:
  
 Windows XP: C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\Vista\Imaging
  
 Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\VistA\Imaging
  
 NOTE: The MAG308.ini  configuration file can no longer be used to configure 
       the TeleReader even though it remains in its original location. 
  
 TeleReader Configurator - Cloning a Reader Profile:
  
 MAG*3.0*127 provides the person responsible for configuring user profiles, 
 the ability to clone a selected profile and apply those privileges to any 
 number of new or pre-existing users. 
  
 During the reader configuration, the user must first select a desired profile 
 to clone. Once that reader profile has been chosen, the user may begin the 
 cloning operations. The new feature is designed so the user may either right 
 click on the reader selected, or select the Clone Reader action button at 
 the bottom of the screen, as displayed in Figure 1.
  
 NOTE: For more information on Figure 1 please refer to the patch description 
       document.
  
 Figure 1, Menu Demonstrating Option to Clone a Reader
  
 After the cloning option has been selected, the site administrator must 
 select the reader(s) whose profile(s) will be created by the master profile. 
 To select a reader, the user must type a minimum of two characters into the 
 search bar. TeleReader Configurator returns user names that meet the search 
 characteristics and lists them in the Available Readers list. Once the 
 Available Readers list has been populated, the user now has the ability to 
 highlight any of the names in the list and move them to the Selected Readers
 list using the forward arrow between the two lists. 
  
 Figure 2, TeleReader Configurator | Search for Available Readers and Select
  
 NOTE: For more information on Figure 2 please refer to the patch description 
       document.
  
 Once the Selected Readers list is complete, the process of creating the new 
 profiles is finalized by selecting the OK  action button. 
  
 This patch also provides the ability to associate a service with multiple 
 procedures within the TeleReader Configurator. This record is created in the 
 TELEREADER ACQUISITION SERVICE file (#2006.5841).
  
 Client Software Changes-Fixes:
 ==============================
  
 TeleReader Configurator:
 ======================== 
  
 *  MAG*3.0*127 has corrected the issue noted from Remedy which limited the
    number of TIU NOTE TITLES to be displayed to the 1st through 44th found 
    within the system; all of TIU NOTE TITLES for consult and clinical 
    procedure classes at the site are now available and displayed for selection.
  
 *  Site administrators using the TeleReader Configurator have the ability to 
    associate multiple procedures to a single service.
        
 *  The TeleReader Configurator has been updated to address the duplication
    of site names by using the institution IEN as an identifier for the station
    number lookup.
  
 *  The TeleReader Configurator is supported on Windows 7 operating system.
    
 TeleReader:
 =========== 
        
 *  On the TeleReader worklist, the reading site column will display the station
    number replacing the three letter site abbreviation. When the reading 
    station number is not set in INSTITUTION file (#4), the IEN of the site 
    will be displayed in parenthesis.
        
 *  The TeleReader has been updated to support locking of patient studies when 
    the site IEN and station number values in INSTITUTION file (#4) are 
    different. 
  
 *  Frequent errors that occurred in the worklist error log have been corrected 
    by checking the integrity of TELEREADER ACQUISITION SERVICE file 
    (#2006.5841).
        
 *  The TeleReader is supported on Windows 7 operating system.
  
 Installation:
 =============  
  
 The TeleReaderConfiguratorSetup.exe portion of this patch is to be installed 
 only on the administrator's workstation. The TeleReader application portion 
 is to be installed on the clinical workstations. 
  
 With the release of this patch, the TeleReader applications will now be 
 supported on both Windows 7 and Windows XP operating systems (OS).  The 
 MAG308.ini configuration file has been renamed to MAG.ini. Both the MAG.ini 
 and MagTeleReaderConfig.ini files have been moved to the file paths listed 
 below:
  
 Windows XP: C:\Documents and settings\All Users\Application Data\Vista\Imaging
  
 Windows 7: C:\ProgramData\VistA\Imaging      
  
 This patch must be installed by the compliance date to conform to VHA 
 Directive 2001-023.
  
 Installation will take less than one minute, with minimal VistA Imaging 
 Activity. 
  
 Note:  All sites running VistA Imaging 3.0 must install the KIDS portion of
        this patch. 
  
 Release of MAG*3.0*122 was the last Imaging Patch that included all three 
 Clinical GUI applications: Clinical Capture, Clinical Display, and TeleReader. 
  
 After MAG*3.0*122, patches may or may not have all three applications 
 included. As a result of this change in the distribution of Clinical GUI 
 applications, the version of each of the three applications that is installed 
 on a workstation may be different.
  
 MAG*3.0*127 only includes TeleReader and TeleReader Configurator applications, 
 so after installing MAG*3.0*127, the workstation will have: 
  
 TeleReader                      Version 3.0 Patch 127
 TeleReader Configurator         Version 3.0 Patch 127
