 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000489238 - VistaWeb buttons are not displaying properly 
  
 PROBLEM:
 ========
 Certain VistaWeb buttons are not functioning properly in older versions 
 of Internet Explorer.
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 VistAWeb is only supported with use of Internet Explorer version 7 or 
 higher.
  
  
 2. HD0000000472296 - Name change 
  
 PROBLEM:
 ========
 If a user's name changes, the name is only updated in the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) at their local site; causing their old name to display on reports 
 that are generated from visiting sites while accessing VistAWeb. This 
 occurs due to the user's name being set from the last VistA system that 
 VistAWeb connects to after selecting a patient.
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 VistAWeb will now retrieve and set user's name from the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) at their home site, instead of from the visiting site that the 
 user is accessing at the time, thus eliminating the issue of displaying 
 incorrect names on reports.
  
  
 3. HD0000000485020 - OOPS error
  
 PROBLEM:
 ========
 VistAWeb throws an OOPs error on patients whose prescriptions contain the 
 less than or greater than "<>" symbols when generating the All Outpatient 
 Pharmacy report and selecting two years or All Results date range.
  
  
 SOLUTION:
 ========= 
 VistAWeb will no longer throw an OOPs error when generating the All 
 Outpatient Pharmacy report and will display any and all patient data 
 whose prescriptions contain the less than or greater than symbols.
  
  
 4. HD0000000491577 - BHS - Resident can't sign on. File 200 issue
  
 PROBLEM: 
 ========
 VistAWeb users receive OOPs error when VistA authenticates the user to 
 the wrong PERSON entry in the NEW PERSON file (#200) in VistA.  This 
 occurs if the user has duplicate entries in the file.
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 VistAWeb will no longer throw an OOPs error and instead ignore the errors 
 but report them as warnings in the error log.
  
  
 5. HD0000000417103 - OOPS Message says contact National HelpDesk
  
 PROBLEM:
 ========
 When an OOPs error is received the message displays, "contact National 
 Help Desk". However, users who receive this should contact their IT staff.
  
 SOLUTION:
 =========
 Now when an OOPs error is received the message displays, "Please contact 
 your local IRM/Computer support staff or IT Help Desk".
