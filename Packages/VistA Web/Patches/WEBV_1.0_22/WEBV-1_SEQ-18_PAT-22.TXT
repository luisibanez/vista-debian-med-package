Subject: NEW ADDITIONS TO THE REMOTE APPLICATION FILE (#8994.5)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will add four new DNS domain entries to the REMOTE APPLICATION
 file (#8994.5). The REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5) was introduced as
 part of the Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) to secure access via the
 remote user or visitor approach by GUI applications.  The remote visitor
 access permits applications where users need to access a large number of
 sites, without requiring a separate access code and verify code at each
 site.
  
 ************************************************************************
 ** PLEASE NOTE: After patch installation, there will be 4 new entries **
 ** for VISTAWEB in the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5).             **
 ** PLEASE DO NOT remove the old VISTAWEB entries from this file. The  **
 ** old entries will be dealt with nation-wide by the VistAWeb team    **
 ** following the retirement of the VistAWeb servers.                  **
