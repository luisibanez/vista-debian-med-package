 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000000863939 - Medication source showing wrong data
  
    Problem:
    ========
    If VistaWeb doesn't find any data for the 'Source' column on the 
    following four sections; Allergies, Medications, Problems and
    Vitals, on the C32 document, it will default to the source of the
    Health Information Exchange (HIE) that sent the C32 and display that
    name as the source.  The source should be only the name of the hospital
    that the patient visited and not the name of HIE Virtual Lifetime
    Electronic Record (VLER) partner.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Code has been changed to remove the reference pointing to HIE VLER
    partner name so that it is not displayed in the 'Source' column.
        
 2) INC000000865358 - Test name is not displaying for test names less than 
                      2 characters long
  
    Problem:
    ========
    If a lab name comes in as just one character (ex. 'K' for Potassium)
    VistaWeb will not display this lab name at all. Currently VistaWeb
    is set to only display names of lab observations if that name is
    greater than one character.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    VistaWeb's code has been changed to display names if their name has
    more than zero characters which will include lab names with only one
    character. 
    
 3) INC000000863982 - VistaWeb is displaying the dose quantity instead of
                      quantity ordered or dispensed.
  
    Problem:
    ========
    Currently, when VistaWeb populates the 'Quantity' column of the
    medication section in a C32, it is set to look for that information in
    a section of code where dosage quantity is stored. This is causing a
    problem because the 'Quantity' column only needs to display the
    quantity of medication dispensed and not the dosage.
  
    Solution:
    =========       
    Code has been removed that references the section where dosage quantity
    is located and only point to the location where quantity of medication
    dispensed is stored. 
  
 4) INC000000809440 - Result values are not displaying
  
    Problem:
    ========
    North Carolina lab results are not displayed on the C32 report.  This 
    issue occurs because North Carolina sends their values to a different
    section of code where VistaWeb does not look at.
  
    Solution:
    =========  
    Code has been modified to add a new place for VistaWeb to look and
    find data for lab results.
  
 5) INC000000874300 - Lab observation shows in Panel name
  
    Problem:
    ========
    VistaWeb takes lab observation name and displays it as lab panel name
    even though there is a different name sent to display as the panel
    name.
  
    Solution:
    =========   
    VistaWeb code has been modified to look in the section of the C32's 
    code, where the lab panel name is populated and display that as panel
    name instead of displaying the lab observation name.
  
 6) INC000000864390 - Procedure date/time missing (SD Beacon and other 
                      Optum possibly)
  
    Problem:
    ========
    VistaWeb currently does not display the 'Date/Time' column for
    San Diego Beacon's C32 in the Procedure section.  This is an issue 
    because even if the data is sent in C32 it will not display.
  
    Solution:
    =========       
    Code has been modified in VistaWeb to add a new section of code that 
    finds data for the 'Date/Time' column.
  
 7) INC000000874602 - Language displayed as patient language is actually 
                      CDA document language
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The section at the top of the C32 document displays patient specific
    information. Amongst other info, this section shows language spoken by
    the patient. If the patient language is not sent in C32, VistaWeb 
    currently selects the 'document language' and displays that as the
    patient's language.
  
    Solution:
    ========= 
    VistaWeb code has been modified so that it no longer selects the 
    'document language' if the patient language is not sent and instead 
    displays a null value.
  
 8) INC000000855582 - Validate/correct that the display of Quantity is 
                      correct (a number and a form, e.g. 30 tablets)
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The 'Quantity' column of the Medication section for all partners'
    C32's shows only the quantity value of the medication without the unit
    type (i.e. tab, mg, etc.) even though unit type is sent in C32.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    VistaWeb code has been modified that added to check for the unit 
    value(s) and display it if the unit type is available. If available 
    if will now show to the right of the quantity value in the 'Quantity'
    column.
  
 9) INC000000809512 - Same Rx# listed for every medication
  
    Problem:
    ========
    In HEALTHeLINK's C32, VistaWeb is taking the physician's ID and
    displaying it as the prescription number for each medication. In many
    cases the prescription number is the same for all medications since it
    is the same physician who prescribed the medications. As a result
    the 'Prescription #' field will have the same value listed.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    VistaWeb code has been modified to look in the correct section of 
    code where the prescription number is and no longer displays the
    physician's ID in the 'Prescription #' column.
