 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)INC000000809456 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
   
    Problem:
    =========
    In the Allergy section of MedVirginia's C32, the 'Reaction' column is
    showing data from other fields.  Data is being displayed in the correct
    field and then again incorrectly in the 'Reaction' column.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    The XSLT stylesheet was looking for the 'Reaction' column data in the
    wrong XML path.  This path is now commented out since it contains the
    allergen name and not the allergy reaction data.
  
  
 2)INC000000809511 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    In the Lab Results section of HEALTHeLINK's C32, the 'Result Type'
    column contains zeroes instead of the names of lab tests.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    A new path was added to the stylesheet which now looks in the correct
    XML node for the needed data.  
  
  
 3)INC000000809515 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    In the Lab results section of HEALTHeLINK's C32, the 'Source' column
    does not display any data (it is currently displaying '--').
  
    Solution:
    =========
    A new path was added in the stylesheet which now looks in the correct
    XML node for the data needed for this partner.
  
  
 4)INC000000809388 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    In the Lab results section of UHIN's C32, the 'Source' column does not
    display any data (it is currently displaying '--').
  
    Solution:
    =========
    A new path was added in the stylesheet which now looks in the correct
    XML node for the data needed for this partner.
  
  
 5)INC000000809400 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    For San Diego Beacon, value  type of string (ST) and encapsulated data
    (ED) is not being recognized in the Lab Results section.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    A line was added in the stylesheet to recognize both the 'ST' and
    'ED' value type.
  
  
 6)INC000000809513 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    In the Medication section of HEALTHeLINK's C32, the 'Quantity' column
    is displaying data that is supposed to go in another column.
    Incorrect data is displayed in the 'Quantity' column then again in the
    correct column.  
  
    Solution:
    =========
    In the stylesheet, Quantity was looking for data in the wrong XML
    node. This was commented out since this particular node is reserved for
    'Sig' column data per Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel
    (HITSP) standards.
  
  
 7)INC000000809365 - VistAWeb - WEBV (Stand Alone) Issue
  
    Problem:
    =========
    There are two issues within this UHIN partner ticket.
       
    First issue: The Medication sections, 'Sig' column is displaying
    the medication name.
       
    Second issue: The Medication section is supposed to be sorted by
    the date in the 'Order Expiration' column.
  
    Solution:
    =========
    Issue one fix: Corrected XPath expression that is locating the data
    needed to go in the 'Sig' column so that it no longer displays
    the medication name.
       
    Issue two fix: Corrected XPath expression that was pointing to the
    node used to sort the medication column.
