 ************************************************************************
  
 VistAWeb V13 includes the following enhancements:
  
 1. Updates to NHIN (Nationwide Health Information Network) Providers
    and Data:
    - Added MedVirginia as a data provider.  They will provide data for
      allergy, patient problems, outpatient pharmacy, labs (Chem & Hem),
      Encounters, and Procedures. 
    - Added Department of Defense as a data provider.
    - Lab data from NHIN data providers will now be aggregated in the
      Chem & Hem report.
    - Domain specific messages from the NHIN providers will now appear in
      the grid report for those domains.  Specifically, they will appear
      in reports for Allergies, Patient Problems, Outpatient Pharmacy,
      and Chem & Hem.
  
 2. Updates to Broker Connections
    - Changes to broker connections to support patch XWB*1.1*35. This will
      increase server thru-put, and decrease network traffic.
    - This change will be invisible to the users.
  
 3. Addition of links in VistAWeb to be able to use the Advanced Web Image
    Viewer Component (AWIV) for image display
    - Added the ability for the VistaWeb browser to display AWIV Columns
      and Image Icon links on the Progress Notes and the Radiology >>
      Imaging categories within VistaWeb.
  
  IMPORTANT NOTE: This version of VistAWeb is the second step in providing 
  the ability to view digital images within the VistAWeb browser.  The full
  functionality to view images in VistAWeb was enabled when Vista Imaging
  patch MAG*3.0*105 was nationally released on January 5, 2011.
  
  As an overview, Imaging Patch MAG*3.0*105 provides an installer for the
  AWIV ActiveX component which is required to be on the user's workstation
  in order for VistAWeb to be able to display digital images.
  
  The VistA Imaging team was responsible for the AWIV's ActiveX deployment
  VA-wide with Imaging patch MAG*3.0*105 and that patch description 
  provides instructions for installing the AWIV ActiveX component.
  
 4. HART (Health Assessment Review Tool) report display
    - Data displayed on the HART report was not truncated in the Comment
      column, so the entire report appeared making the row unreasonably
      tall.
    - The report will now have similar truncating for HART data as is done
      in CPRS. This will reduce the size of the report and make it easier
      for the user to read. The entire text of the comment field will be
      available in the detailed display window.
 
 5. Section 508 (Accessibility) Changes
     NOTE: Most changes will be noticeable primarily by users that utilize 
           accessibility tools, such as JAWS or WindowEyes
    - Addition of links to the main content area in reports
    - Rework of the report pages to use fewer web frames
    - Addition of alternate text for some components
  
 6. Remedy Tickets Resolved
    #384880, #384940, #385962 - Allergy report errors out if a connection 
       cannot be made to station 200 (patients with no station 200 data 
       do not throw an error).
