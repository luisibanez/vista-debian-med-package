Description:
============

 This patch primarily implements new functionality within VistA's Personnel
 and Accounting Integrated Data/ Enhanced Time and Attendance (PAID/ETA)
 software version 4.0 to provide appropriate data to VANOD (Veterans
 Affairs Nursing Outcomes Database) in accordance with Public Law 107-135
 and the OIG Recommendation 4a (annual reporting requirement).  The patch
 also includes minor modifications to existing ETA functionality to support
 the collection of data for the VANOD.
  
 This patch is dependent on the Nursing Service patch-NUR*4*43.  The 
 Nursing service patch also supports the collection of data for the
 VANOD.  Patch NUR*4*43 must be installed prior to patch PRS*4*126.
   
 The patch implements functionality to gather and store information related
 to nurses providing direct patient care (as well as indirect care).  It
 provides functionality to enter, edit, update, review, certify and store
 this information.  The system provides the ability for a point to point 
 transfer of this information from each VistA instance to the VANOD. 
    
 The new options included in this patch utilize existing time and 
 attendance data and provide the ability to capture new data elements in
 order to provide a complete set of data related to nurses point of care
 and mandatory overtime.
  
 Product Perspective:
 --------------------
  
 The VistA PAID/ETA package is VHA's time and attendance system.  The 
 system tracks employee timecards, leave requests, overtime requests etc.
  
 The posting of ETA timecard data continues to be the responsibility of 
 timekeepers.  The ETA timecard data is not affected by any new 
 functionality included in this patch.  The ETA timecard data provides the
 basis for capturing additional data and building Nurse Point of Care (POC)
 Daily Time records. The Nurse POC Daily Time records are separate from ETA
 timecard records.  Any changes to the Nurse POC Daily Time records will
 not result in changes to the ETA timecards.
  
 The enhancements made by this patch are summarized below:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
 System ADPAC and/or the VANOD Site Coordinator
 ----------------------------------------------
 The following describes the enhancements made by this patch to implement 
 division setup, maintenance and continuing operations for Nurse Point of 
 Care ( NPOC) System ADPAC and/or the VANOD Site Coordinator.  There may be
 a separate coordinator for each division on the VistA system and sites may
 determine setup by division and may determine whether these menus and
 options should be assigned to coordinators within each division.
  
 The following new menu has been added which contains all the Nurse POC 
 options and reports for the NPOC Coordinator:
  
    Nurse POC Coordinator Menu [PRSN COORDINATOR MENU]
    -------------------------------------------------- 
  
  
  The Nurse POC Coordinator Menu contains the following new options:
  
  1.     Release Corrected POC Data for VANOD Extract [PRSN POC CORRECT 
         RELEASE]
      This option provides the VANOD Site Coordinator or designee the 
      ability to review and release POC data that has been released in the
      past and has subsequently been corrected and approved.  The option
      releases all records for the day that has been corrected and may
      release additional days if they have been impacted by the
      correction.  E.g., a two day tour that is corrected may impact the
      following day and that day would also need to be rebuilt and
      released.
  
  2.     Release Pay Period POC Data for VANOD Extract [PRSN POC RELEASE]
      This option provides ability to review POC data for a pay period and 
      release that data for extraction to VANOD.  Select a single division 
      or all divisions for release, and optionally view all POC/ETA
      mismatches for the selected release group.
       
      The option transfers records from the POC Daily Time Records (#451) 
      file to the POC Daily Activity Extraction (#451.7) file.
  
  3.     Return Approved Nurse POC Daily Time Record [PRSN RET APPROVED 
         POC RECORD]
      This option allows the ADPAC/VANOD Site Coordinator to return 
      previously approved POC time records for additional editing by data
      entry personnel.
       
      The following types of records can be returned:
      1.  An Approved Nurse POC Daily Time record, that has never been
          Released.
      2.  An Approved Nurse POC Daily Time record that has been Released 
          and has subsequently been Corrected.
       
      When returning records of type 1 above, the system will change the 
      status of the Nurse POC Daily Time record for that nurse and date to
      POC record exists and pay period status will be Open.  This will
      allow the POC Data Entry Personnel to edit or delete any records
      during that pay period.
       
      When returning records of type 2 above, the system will change the 
      status of the Nurse POC Daily Time record for that nurse and date to
      Corrected. This will allow the POC Data Entry Personnel to edit or
      delete the correction for that day.
       
  
  The Nurse POC Coordinator Menu also contains the following new submenus:
  
  1.     Package Maintenance [PRSN SITE MAINTENANCE COORD]
         Menu option holding maintenance options for the VANOD site
         coordinator.
  
        This submenu contains the following new options:
  
  A.     Edit POC Division Access Parameter [PRSN POC APPLICATION 
         PARAMETER]
      The option provides the VANOD site coordinator the ability to set 
      the access parameter for POC data to either T&L unit or Nursing
      Location for each division.  This parameter will determine how data 
      entry personnel and data approval personnel access nurses for the 
      division.
  
  B.     Edit Update T&L Unit POC Users [PRSN TL POC]
      This option allows the PEV ADPAC to enter and edit POC Entry and 
      Approval personnel for a T&L Unit.
  
  C.     Show Nurse Count by Location and T&L Unit [PRSN SHOW POC SYSTEM 
         SETUP]
      This option lists divisions and the locations in those divisions.  
      It shows how many nurses from various T&Ls are assigned to those
      locations. 
          
  D.     Show Nurse Detail by Location or T&L Unit [PRSN NURSES BY LOC/T&L]
      This option lists Nurse details sorted by nurse location or T&L unit 
      for the selected division(s).
  
  E.     Copy ETA personnel to POC personnel [PRSN COPY ETA TO POC]
      This option will DELETE ALL existing POC data entry and approval 
      personnel. Then it will copy ETA timekeepers to POC data entry and 
      ETA supervisors to POC approval personnel. Employees with an * in
      front of their name are separated and will NOT be copied.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post install routine PRSXP126 will build the new indexes required.
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system, however, it should
 be installed at a non-peak time to minimize disruption to the users. It
 is strongly recommended that all the PAID ETA options in the OPTION
 (#19) file be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the
 KIDS install.
  
 All the ETA options can be selected by using the PAID ETA namespace of 
 PRS*, to disable all PAID ETA options. Other VISTA users will not be 
 affected.

         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
