Subject: ETA UPDATES FOR HYBRID TABLE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Public Law 111-163, the Omnibus Health Services Act effective May 5, 2010
  authorized the conversion of Nursing Assistants with occupation series
  GS-0621, from title 5 competitive service to the title 38 hybrid excepted 
  service.
  
  The following public laws have also provided the authority to both add 
  additional occupation series to hybrid excepted service and to remove some 
  existing occupation series/titles from hybrid excepted service.
  
    1. Public Law 108-422
    2. Public Law 108-170
  
  This patch updates the PAID Enhanced Time and Attendance (ETA) software,
  providing updates to the software's Hybrid table which is coded in routine
  PRSAENT1.  The patch updates the table so that the occupation series/title
  entries match the list of occupation series/titles that are currently
  authorized as hybrid positions under public law. 
  
  The following occupation series/titles are converted to hybrid positions by
  adding their occupation series/title codes to the VistA ETA Hybrid table:
   
                                              Occupation series/
            Title                             title code

  Remedy Overview:
  ================
  1.  HD0000000466098 - Hybrid Employees (0621)/Saturday Premium Pay Issue
  
  Problem:
  --------
  
  On February 17, 2011, 5540 Nursing Assistants, Occupation Series 0621, were 
  converted to Hybrid status from Health Care worker status.  Prior to the 
  conversion, the Employee Pay Entitlements table displayed Saturday Premium 
  as "Yes".  Since the conversion the Saturday Premium changed to "No".  
  Hybrid positions are entitled to Saturday Premium pay.
  
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  
  The Nursing Assistants were converted to hybrids in the Central PAID system 
  and their type of appointment updated with a 5 or 6, via an edit and update 
  download from Central PAID to VistA PAID ETA field stations. The VistA ETA 
  software is updated to include the occupation series/title codes of the 
  employees in the Hybrid table in order to recognize the employees as hybrids.
  
  
   2. HD0000000439332 - Employees not receiving Saturday premium pay
  
  Problem:
  --------
  
  Employees listed as medical instrument techs, with occupational series/title 
  code of 064933 and type of appointment of 5, are not receiving Saturday 
  premium pay.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  
  The resolution for the Medical Instrument Techs is exactly as stated for the 
  Nursing Assistants in the solution to HD0000000466098, listed above in 
  Remedy item #1.  The techs occupation series/title code is added to the 
  Hybrid table.
  
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ==========================
