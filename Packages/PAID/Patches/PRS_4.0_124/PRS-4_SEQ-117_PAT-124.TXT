 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
  
 1. HD0000000261220 - Employees are able to certify their own corrected
                      timecard without security key
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An Overtime/Comp Time (OT/CT) Supervisor is able to certify his/her own 
 corrected timecard without having the "PRSA SIGN" key.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRSAPPX was modified to disallow employees from approving their
 own corrected timecard if they do not have the "PRSA SIGN" key.
  
  
 2. HD0000000266014  Time card issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a POSTING/TOUR CHANGE is done under PRIOR PAY PERIOD ADJUSTMENT for
 an employee who has a Duty Basis of Intermittent and their Tour of Duty
 is changed to a fixed tour in error, the employee's Tour of Duty
 cannot be changed back to Intermittent.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PRSATPP was modified to allow Intermittent as a valid Tour of 
 Duty for an employee who has a Duty Basis of Intermittent and has
 had their Tour of Duty changed from Intermittent to a fixed tour.
