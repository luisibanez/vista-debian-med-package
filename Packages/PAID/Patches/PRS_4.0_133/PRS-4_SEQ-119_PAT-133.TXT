 The enhancements made by this patch are summarized below:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  
  
 Regular Comp Time/Credit Hours Expansion to Cover 26 Pay Periods
 ---------------------------------------------------
 The provisions for the expiration of Comp Time and Credit Hours were
 revised effective February 18, 2007.  The time period in which an 
 employee may use earned compensatory time was revised from 8 pay 
 periods to 26 periods.  The time limit on the use of earned Credit 
 Hours was eliminated.  However, the restriction on carrying no more 
 than 24 credit hours into the next pay period continues to apply.  
 Compensatory Time and Credit Hours will continue to be stored in the 
 same balance and if necessary, ETA users will continue to manually 
 track the portion of the balances that are credit hours.
  
 Since the revision to the expiration of comp time rules, the Austin Automation
 Technology Center (AITC) was updated to support storing 26 pay periods of
 comp time which is reported to the AITC each pay period from VistA PAID/ETA. 
 AITC was also updated to maintain the total balance of an employee's
 COMPTIME/CREDIT HOURS and transmit that to VISTA PAID ETA in the existing
 COMPTIME download field.  The value transmitted from AITC to VistA PAID ETA
 each pay period is the current unused balance of COMPTIME/CREDIT HRS earned
 over the last 26 pay periods and ETA stores this balance in the PAID EMPLOYEE
 file (#450) in the COMPTIME/CREDIT HRS BALANCE field (#496).
  
 This patch updates the following options in VistA PAID ETA to use the correct
 total comp time/credit hours balance and to extend the expiration of comp time
 from 8 to 26 pay periods from when it was earned.
  
  
 Comp Time/Credit Hour Pay Period Balance Display
 ------------------------------------------------
 The following options that display Comp Time/Credit Hours balances and their 
 expiration dates are modified to support the change in comp time expiration
 rules.
  
    Leave Balances [PRSA LV BAL-EMP]
    Employee Leave Balances [PRSA LV BAL-TK]
    Employee Leave Balances [PRSA LV BAL-SUP]
  
 VistA PAID ETA receives only 8 individual comp time/credit hours balances for
 up to 8 pay periods.  This patch makes the following updates to the report:
    1.  Includes total comp time/credit hours balance from the last 26 pay
        periods.
    2.  Restructures report in easier to read columnar format
    3.  Includes the pay period in which the comp time/credit hours was earned,
        when available.
    4.  When an employee has balances in more than 8 pay periods, the
        additional pay period balances will be summarized in the last line of
        the itemized comp time/credit hours listing.
    5.  'must be used by' dates are extended from 8 to 26 pay periods.
  
 The before and after examples below are included to illustrate the changes to
 the leave reports.

 Supervisory Approvals Functionality
 -----------------------------------
  
 Prior to this patch, VistA PAID ETA, used the sum of the balances from the 8
 individual pay periods that are transmitted by the AITC to determine and
 display an employee's total available comp time/credit hours balance.  However,
 the employee may have balances in more than 8 individual pay periods-up to 26. 
 In these cases the employee's comp time/credit hours balance is understated to
 the Supervisor in this option.
  
 The Supervisory Approvals [PRSA SUP CERT] option is updated to display the
 correct available total balance from the COMPTIME/CREDIT HRS BALANCE field
 (#496) in the PAID EMPLOYEE file (450) when a comp time/credit hours request is
 displayed to the supervisor for approval.  This field contains the unused
 balance of all comp time/credit hours earned over the past 26 pay periods.
