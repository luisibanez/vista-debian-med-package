Subject: DECEMBER 24, 2012 HOLIDAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 On 12/21/2012, President Obama signed an executive order that excuses
 executive branch non-Postal Service employees from duty on Monday, 
 December 24, 2012, except where agency officials decide they must 
 remain open because of national security, defense, 
 or other public reasons.
  
 When the President signs an executive order declaring a non-holiday day
 as an official holiday, a patch must be released that will modify the
 software to identify this non-holiday day as a holiday.
  
 This declared holiday falls within pay period 12-26 which runs from
 12/16/2012 through 12/29/2012.
  
 Payroll usually opens pay periods on the Thursday immediately preceding
 the first day of the pay period. For pay period 12-26 this would be
 Thursday 12/13/2012.  For pay period 12-27, this would be Thursday, 
 12/27/2012. However, the VistA PAID/Enhanced Time & Attendance
 (ETA) software will allow the opening of pay periods up to 7 days prior
 to the first day of the pay period.
  
 Patch PRS*4*139 adds December 24, 2012 as a holiday to the Enhanced Time
 and Attendance module of PAID 4.0 (ETA) software. 
 Because Pay Period 12-26 is already open at the sites, this patch will 
 loop through PP 12-26 Time & Attendance records and set the holiday 
 as needed.
 Once the patch is installed, December 24, 2012 will be treated as all 
 other holidays in ETA.

 Problem:
 --------
 Presidential Executive Order declares December 24, 2012 as an official 
 federal holiday.  PAID ETA must be updated to reflect this additional
 holiday.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified routine PRS8HD to add December 24, 2012 to list of official 
 holidays for 2012.  Created routine PRSXP139 to loop through Pay Period
 12-26 Time & Attendance records and set the holiday.
