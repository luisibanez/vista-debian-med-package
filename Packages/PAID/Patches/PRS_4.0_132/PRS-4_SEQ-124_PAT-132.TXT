Description:
============

 This patch introduces the functionality changes that must be made to the
 VistA Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data/Enhanced Time and Attendance
 (PAID/ETA) software to support the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010 (Public Law
 111-292), approved by President Barack Obama on December 9, 2010.  The act
 provides the Federal Government with improved flexibility in managing its
 workforce through the use of telework. The Act directs federal agencies to
 satisfy mandatory data collection and reporting requirements beginning with the
 first report to Congress not later than 18 months from enactment (June 2012)
 and on an annual basis thereafter. This includes identifying and reporting the
 number of hours their employees telework. Specifically, this patch
 introduces functionality updates to account for scheduled, unscheduled,
 and medical telework hours performed by Veterans Affairs employees.
