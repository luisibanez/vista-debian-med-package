 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000589219  LEX - NNU vs VA = Compensatory Time Lookup
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In May 2011, National Nurses United (NNU) filed a National Grievance
 against the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The National Grievance
 alleged that Nurses (NNU RN's) were being negatively affected because 
 changes to VA's Time and Attendance System (ETA) that would allow 
 accrued compensatory time (CT) to expire in 26 pay periods had not
 been made.  In some instances, this resulted in NNU RNs losing their
 accrued CT before having the opportunity to use it or to be 
 compensated for it, if they were eligible.
   
 On November 17, 2011, NNU and the VA entered into a settlement 
 agreement that provided for the restoration of NNU RNs' lost CT
 between the periods of November 11, 2007 through November 17, 2011.
 Any restored CT time must be available for the NNU RNs' use
 within 26 pay periods from the effective date of its restoration.
   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Payroll office staffs were tasked with having their IT personnel
 create a Fileman routine that would capture all the CT earned for the
 period of November 11, 2007 through November 17, 2011.
  
 Because FileMan is limited to searching through one file at a time,
 a comprehensive report could not be produced using only FileMan.
 A routine has been written that identifies those employees with a
 Occupation/Series Code of 061050 and displays the CT Earned and 
 CT Used for pay periods 07-23 through 11-23.The routine is PRSXP134.
  
 *** Report Instructions (after patch install) ***
 -------------------------------------------------
 This report resides in the Payroll Main Menu [PRSA PAY MENU] as
 option number 50 - NNU CT SETTLEMENT REPORT [PRSX NNU SETTLEMENT REPORT].
 It will only ask for an output device and it can be queued (recommended).
  
 The size of this report will vary by site.  It is recommended to run the
 report after hours for optimum processing speed. The report may be run as
 many times as needed.  
  
 This report contains all Comp Time Earned and Comp Time Used for 
 employees with Occupation/Series code of 061050 for pay periods
 07-23 through 11-23.  The official effective dates for this 
 settlement are November 11, 2007 through November 17, 2011.  
 November 11, 2007 is the first day of pay period 07-23 and 
 November 17, 2011 is the 12th day of pay period 11-23.
 If a nurse identified on the report has CT activity for pay 
 period 11-23, the timecard for that nurse will need to be viewed
 manually and any CT activity subtracted from the report if that 
 CT activity falls on the 13th or 14th day of pay period 11-23.
