Subject: CLEAN UP OF FILE 15

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The purpose of patch XT*7.3*129 is to clean up the local VistA DUPLICATE
  RECORD (#15) file for entries that were created by a push from the Master
  Patient Index (MPI) before the Health Care Identity Management (HC IdM)
  team completed their reviewed of the records.
   
  Background:
  ===========
  HC IdM found during testing, that when a Potential Duplicate Exception
  is created in the Identity Management Toolkit, the local records involved
  are automatically pushed down and populated in the VistA DUPLICATE RECORD
  (#15) file before HC IdM dispositions the exception.  This is an issue
  because the local site could potentially merge the two PATIENT (#2) file
  records before HC IdM performs their analysis and before HC IdM resolves
  the exception.  The local records could potentially be determined by HC IdM
  as DO NOT LINK, and if so, the local site should not receive the records
  in File #15.
    
  Requirement:
  ============
  The VistA DUPLICATE RECORD (#15) file will be automatically populated only
  when HC IdM has resolved a Potential Duplicate Exception in the Identity
  Management Toolkit with a disposition to link two local records.
   
  Changes:
  ========
  Patch XT*7.3*129 is part of three components to address the issue
  described above.
   
   1. MPI*1.0*85 will be installed on the MPI. It includes a change to stop
  the MPI from automatically adding entries to the VistA DUPLICATE RECORD
  (#15) file as a result of search processing.
   
   2. XT*7.3*129 (this patch) will then be installed at the VistA sites.  It
  includes a POST-INSTALL routine that queues a TaskMan task to purge the
  DUPLICATE RECORD (#15) file of POTENTIAL DUPLICATE, UNVERIFIED records that
  were previously pushed by the MPI.
   
   3. After all VistA sites have XT*7.3*129 installed, a manual task will
  then be run on the MPI.  EN^MPIVDUP (exported in patch MPI*1.0*86) will
  add record pairs identified on the MPI as potential duplicates to the
  local VistA DUPLICATE RECORD (#15) file.

  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XT*7.3*129 contains 
  changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of VISTA
  Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does not
  alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety
  critical elements functions.
   
  RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XT*7.3*129 have no effect on Blood 
  Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
      
  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  The POST-INSTALL routine queues a process to delete records with the
  following characteristics from the VistA DUPLICATE RECORD (#15) file:
   - RECORD1 (#.01) and RECORD2 (#.02) pertain to the PATIENT (#2) file.
   - STATUS (field #.03) = 'P' for POTENTIAL DUPLICATE, UNVERIFIED, and
   - MERGE STATUS (field #.05) = 0 or "", and
   - WHO CREATED (field #.09) = POSTMASTER (.5).
   
  The tasked process stores information in the ^XTMP("XT73P129") global.
  The purge date in the 0 node is set to 60 days from the run date.
   
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,0,"CNT")       : # records deleted
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,0,"COMPLETED") : completion time, FM format
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,0,"DUZ")       : DUZ of user that queued
                                                 the process
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,0,"STARTED")   : start time, FM format
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,0,"STATUS")    : status information
   ^XTMP("XT73P129",fmStartTime,IEN,0)         : 0 node of record deleted
   
  On successful completion, a MailMan message is sent to the POSTMASTER and
  to the person that ran the installation.  The MailMan message provides
  the following information.
   
  Subj: XT*7.3*129 POST-INSTALL COMPLETE  [#133294] 01/25/11@22:45
  From: POSTMASTER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*

  147 records were deleted from the DUPLICATE RECORD File (#15).
   
  The 0 nodes of deleted records are backed up in:
