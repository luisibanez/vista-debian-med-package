  "*** WARNING!!!  You have verified these two records are the SAME   
  patient.  Once these records are merged, there is no automated way to   
  "un-do" the merge.  If you are not certain these are the same patient,   
  edit the status back to 'Potential Duplicate, Unverified' and repeat 
  the verification process.  For additional assistance, please log a
