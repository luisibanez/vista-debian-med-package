Subject: CHECK MPI DO NOT LINK FILE BEFORE ADDING TO FILE #15

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  XT*7.3*124 is a required build for patch XT*7.3*125.
  
  Issue #1:
  Health Care Identity Management (HC IdM) requested that when the Add
  Verified Duplicate Pair [XDR ADD VERIFIED DUPS] option in the Kernel
  Toolkit's Duplicate Record Merge software is used, that a check be made
  to the MPI DO NOT LINK (#985.28) file on the Master Patient Index (MPI)
  to ensure that the records have not already been identified as a DO NOT
  LINK pairing. If the pair is identified as Not A Duplicate, the user
  will be prevented from adding it to the DUPLICATE RECORD (#15) file.
  
  In order to accomplish this, when records from the PATIENT (#2) file
  are selected for merging, the XDRMADD routine has been modified to
  check for the existence of an MPI extrinsic function introduced in
  patch MPIF*1.0*55.  The MPI extrinsic function uses the DIRECT^XWB2HL7
  API (IA #3144) to call an MPI Remote Procedure that returns the list
  of patients that are marked as not a duplicate with one of the selected
  patients.
  
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following KERNEL Duplicate Resolution System VISTA documentation is
  available, updated for patch XT*7.3*125.  Facilities should download the
  revised documentation listed as follows:
  
       Technical Manual                    xt_73_p125_tm.pdf
