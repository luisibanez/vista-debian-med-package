 Installation Instructions
 =========================
 ** Although queuing of this patch is allowed, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 that ALL Users be off the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED
 before this patch is installed. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in
 a wait state. Failure to do so may result in 'source routine edited'
 errors. **
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise 
 that the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than one minute.
  
     1. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu.  
        This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.  
  
     2. The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
        system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.  
   
     3. On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
        following options: 
            Print Transport Global 
            Compare Transport Global to Current System 
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global 
  
      4. In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
        installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and 
        ALL non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site 
        specific procedures. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait
        state.  All users should be off the system. NOT performing this step
        could result in 'source routine edited' error.
