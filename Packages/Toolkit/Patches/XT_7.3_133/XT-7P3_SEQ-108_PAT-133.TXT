Subject: XINDEX doesn't support Cache Objects

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch allows the XINDEX utility to correctly handle Cache Objects.
 XINDEX will no longer consider Cache Objects an error. It will track the
 objects and list them in the summary, similar to the way it track routine
 tags. This patch also screens Kernel and FileMan routines from errors that
 they have a SAC exemption.
