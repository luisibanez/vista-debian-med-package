                             Patch XT*7.3*130
  
 This patch does the following things:
  
 1) Fixes Report 'Patch Statistics by Compliance Date'[XTPM PATCH STATS BY
    COMPLIANCE]. The report is inaccurate as it does not show '# Days
    Delinquent' for patches that were not installed on time.
  
    For example:
    -----------
  
  Report before this patch:
  
  Compliance   Patch      Release   Install                   # Days
  Date         Number     Date      Date        Priority    Delinquent
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  FEB 5,2011   MAG*3*105 JAN 5,2011 FEB 11,2011 Mandatory   
                                                           =========
                                                            
              ('# Days Delinquent' should be 6 days.)
  
  
  Report after this patch:
  
  Compliance   Patch      Release   Install                   # Days
  Date         Number     Date      Date        Priority    Delinquent
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  FEB 5,2011   MAG*3*105 JAN 5,2011 FEB 11,2011 Mandatory     6 days
                                                              ======
  
 2) Corrects problem of missing number two "2" of the year on the 'Patch 
    Statistics by Compliance Date' report. This happens for NON-KIDS 
    patches.
  
    For example:
    -----------
  
  Report before this patch:
  
  Compliance   Patch      Release   Install                   # Days
  Date         Number     Date      Date        Priority    Delinquent
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  
  MAR 9,2011  WEBV*1*20  MAR 9,2011  MAR 9,011  Mandatory  
                                     =========
  
    (2 for the year of 2011 is missing for Install Date.)
  
   
  Report after this patch:
  
  Compliance   Patch      Release   Install                   # Days
  Date         Number     Date      Date        Priority    Delinquent
  --------------------------------------------------------------------  
  MAR 9,2011 WEBV*1*20 MAR 9,2011  MAR 9,2011   Mandatory
                                   ==========
  
 3) Adds a new option 'Patch Statistics by Released Date' [XTPM PATCH 
    STATS BY RELEASED] for 'Patch Reports' menu [XTPM PATCH REPORTS].
  
         NAME: XTPM PATCH STATS BY RELEASED
         MENU TEXT: Patch Statistics by Released Date
