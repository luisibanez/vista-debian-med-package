 The CPRS RESPONSE TIME MONITOR was originally released as part of Kernel 
 Toolkit (patch XT*7.3*84). However, most of its functionality has now 
 transitioned to the new Capacity Management Tools 3.0 package, in 
 particular the ability to track timing date for coversheet load times 
 (but not individual coversheet sections). The national web server 
 supporting the CPRS Response Time Monitor application has been shut down. 
 The following instructions are intended to assist sites in shutting down 
 the CPRS Response Time Monitor if it is no longer being used locally.
  
 1. Some sites may still use the CPRS Response Time Monitor with a local 
 web server. In this case you would not want to shut down the CPRS 
 Response Time Monitor. Look in the CPRS MONITOR (#177100.12) file if the
 WEB SERVER ADDRESS, WEB SERVER FTP USER, and WEB SERVER FTP PASSWORD
 fields are populated, there is a good chance your site may still be using
 the CPRS RESPONSE MONITOR, locally.
  
 For example:
  
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: CPRS MONITOR// 
 Select CPRS MONITOR FACILITY:    ZZ ALBANY
 ANOTHER ONE: 
 STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes//   (Yes)
 Include COMPUTED fields:  (N/Y/R/B): NO//  - No record number (IEN), no 
 Computed
 Fields
  
 FACILITY: ZZ ALBANY                     TIU TAB: OFF
   LAB COVERSHEET: OFF                   REMINDERS COVERSHEET: OFF
   HFS LOCATION: USER4:TEST              WEB PAGE NAME: cprsmonitor500
   NUMBER OF HOURS TO DISPLAY: 8         MAXIMUM SECONDS TO DISPLAY: 30
   TIU LINE COLOR: 192,0,0               LAB LINE COLOR: 0,192,0
   REMINDERS LINE COLOR: 0,0,192         DISPLAY GRID?: YES
   BACKGROUND COLOR: 230,230,230         NUMBER OF DAYS TO KEEP DATA: 7
   WEB PAGE ROOT LOCATION: //            LOG VMS FTP ACTIVITY: NO
   SYSTEM ACTIVE: NO                     DELETE OLD COM FILES (VMS): YES
   STATION NUMBER: 500                   WEB SERVER ADDRESS: XXXXXXXXXXX
   WEB SERVER FTP USER: SCHMIT,R         WEB SERVER FTP PASSWORD: <Hidden>
   NATIONAL FTP SERVER ADDRESS: vaftp.va.gov
   NATIONAL FTP USER: itmuser            NATIONAL FTP PASSWORD: <Hidden>
  
 If your site is not using the CPRS Response Time Monitor locally, 
 you can continue with steps 2-5 below.
  
 If your site IS using the CPRS RESPONSE TIME MONITOR LOCALLY, 
 go to step 6.
  
 2. Set the "Master Switch" for CPRS Monitor "OFF". To do this, use the
 "Edit CPRS Monitor Parameter File" [AWCM EDIT PARAM FILE] option,
 available from the CPRS Monitor Main Menu [AWCM MAIN]. Look at the value
 for the SYSTEM ACTIVE field. Set it to "NO".
  
 For example:
  
 Using the CPRS Monitor Main Menu:
  
             ==>>  1    Edit CPRS Monitor Parameter File
                   2    Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data
                   3    Purge CPRS Monitor Data
                   4    Roll Up Data to National Database
                   5    Re-send Data to National Server
  
 Select CPRS Monitor Main Menu  Option: 1   Edit CPRS Monitor Parameter
                                            File
  
 Edit the CPRS Monitor Parameter File
  
 Select CPRS MONITOR FACILITY:    <Your facility>
 SYSTEM ACTIVE: YES//NO
  
 3. Check the Option Scheduling file to see if any of the following 
 options are scheduled (Schedule/Unschedule Options). If any are present 
 and active, un-schedule them -- by entering the @-sign in the Option name 
 field:
  
  - Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data [AWCM CPRS MONITOR]
  - Local Nightly Rollup [AWCM LOCAL ROLLUP]
  - Roll Up Data to National Database [AWCM ROLL UP NATIONAL DATA]
  - Purge CPRS Monitor Data [AWCM PURGE CPRS MONITOR DATA]
  
 For example:
  
 Select OPTION to schedule or reschedule:    AWCM CPRS MONITOR  (R)
  
                           Edit Option Schedule
  
 Option Name: AWCM CPRS MONITOR  <<< Enter "@" here to un-schedule

            (EXITING WITHOUT SAVING WILL NOT RESTORE DELETED RECORDS.)
 Are you sure you want to delete this entire record (Y/N)?Y  <<<< select

 4. Disable the options: Set OUT OF ORDER for these options.
  
  - Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data  [AWCM CPRS MONITOR]
  - Local Nightly Rollup [AWCM LOCAL ROLLUP]
  - Roll Up Data to National Database [AWCM ROLL UP NATIONAL DATA]
  - Purge CPRS Monitor Data [AWCM PURGE CPRS MONITOR DATA]
  
 For example: 
  
 Select Menu Management Option: edit options
  
 Select OPTION to edit: AWCM CPRS MONITOR  Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data
 NAME: AWCM CPRS MONITOR// 
 MENU TEXT: Generate CPRS Monitor Web Data  Replace 
 PACKAGE: 
 OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE: NO FURTHER USE per XT*7.3*134 <<<< Enter a text line

 LOCK: ^
  
 5. Optionally examine the contents of the VMS directory specified in the 
 "HFS LOCATION" field of the CPRS Monitor (#177100.12) file, if a
 location is specified by that field. Files that might be left around in
 this location include a web page file, AWCMOVEHTM.COM, and AWCMOVEHTM.LOG.
 These host files can be deleted at the site's discretion.
  
 For example: 
  
 VA FileMan 22.0
  
 Select OPTION: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES  
  
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: CPRS MONITOR
  
 Select CPRS MONITOR FACILITY: `1  facility name
  
 FACILITY: facility name
   TIU TAB: ON                           LAB COVERSHEET: ON
   REMINDERS COVERSHEET: ON              HFS LOCATION: user$:[xxx.TEMP]
  
 You may check the directory user$:[xxx.TEMP] to delete the two web page 
 files.
  
 From VMS level:
  
 ISC6A2$ dir user$:[xxx.TEMP]            <<< dir user$:[xxx.TEMP]
 AWCMOVEHTM.COM;1                AWCMOVEHTM.LOG;1
  
 SC6A2$ del AWCMOVEHTM.COM;1             <<< del AWCMOVEHTM.COM;1
 SC6A2$ del AWCMOVEHTM.LOG;1             <<< del AWCMOVEHTM.LOG;1
  
 6. If you are using the CPRS Monitor Locally do step 3 and ONLY 
 un-schedule the following option:
  
   Roll Up Data to National Database [AWCM ROLL UP NATIONAL DATA]
