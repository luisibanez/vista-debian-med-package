Subject: VBA DATA SHARING VISTA HINQ RESPONSE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

  *********************************ATTENTION***********************************
  NOTE: This patch is an emergency released with a 48-hour compliance.  Failure
  to install this patch within the compliance date will cause Hospital Inquiry
  (HINQ) Response software to display garbled data and negatively impact the
  HINQ upload process for new HINQ requests.
   
     The Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) will suspend
         responses to Hospital Inquiry (HINQ) queries until all sites have
         successfully installed this patch in their production accounts.  
   
     Users will receive the following message when attempting to request a
         HINQ during the AITC down time.  
   
         Connecting to VBA database
         FTA15:   Device is busy
         Enter requests in the Suspense file
   
     Users may still enter requests into the HINQ Suspense file, to be
         processed once the 48 hour compliance period has ended.
   
     The software is not backward compatible; therefore HINQ Responses
         received prior to installation of the patch may appear garbled when
         viewed and may not upload appropriately.  It will be necessary for
         facility staff to request new HINQs for affected patients as needed.
   
  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) has requested changes to the
  Vista Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility (Vista REE) to function
  with changes to the Enrollment Systems Redesign (ESR) in the HINQ
  Response and Display for the VBA Data Sharing project.

  These new data elements will be contained in the HINQ Response based upon
