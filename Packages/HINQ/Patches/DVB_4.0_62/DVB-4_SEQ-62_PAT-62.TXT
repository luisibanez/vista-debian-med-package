Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) system to support technology and 
 business changes that are occurring with the implementation of the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) 
 project.
  
 The MSDS project will introduce an MSDS Broker that will be activated in 
 ESR. The Broker will construct a definitive military service data set 
 including data received from the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), the
 Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS) and VistA.
 Once the MSDS Broker is activated, ESR becomes the authoritative source
 for Military Service Episode data. The verified data will be shared from
 ESR to all VistA sites of record for the veteran. The ESR-verified
 Military Service Episode data cannot be edited by VistA except to add new
 episodes. An unlimited number of military service episodes per veteran
 will now be supported.
  
 This patch is being released along with patches DG*5.3*797, EAS*1.0*92, 
 IVM*2.0*141, and PXRM*2.0*21 in host file DG_53_P797.KID.
     
 This patch modifies the Hospital Inquiry (HINQ) v4.0 application as
 described below:
   
  
 1.  Modify display of Military Service Episodes
 -----------------------------------------------
 The MSDS changes introduced by patch DG*5.3*797 include a new MILITARY 
 SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#2.3216) added to the PATIENT file (#2) to store
 the veteran's military service episodes.  Modifications were made to the
 HINQ options that display the veteran's military service episodes
 (MSEs).  If the veteran has MSE data in the new MSE location in the
 PATIENT file (#2), those MSEs will be displayed, otherwise the MSEs in the
 old data dictionary locations will be displayed.
  
 2.  Modify HINQ update option
 -----------------------------
 The Update HINQs to the Patient File option [DVB HUPLOAD] was modified.  
 If authoritative military service data has already been received from ESR,
 the filing of MSE data from the HINQ Suspense file will be blocked and a
 message will be displayed to the user.
