 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA)
 Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*74/LR*5.2*350 contains changes to 
 software controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-053, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK 
 SOFTWARE. Changes include: 
    Routines:
      LRU
      LRX
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*74/LR*5.2*350 have no effect 
 on Blood Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*74/LR*5.2*350 
 does not alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety 
 critical elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 2 routines and 
 0 files identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 
 2004-053, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: 
 There are no validation requirements by option for this patch.
  
 MINIMAL TEST CASE SCENARIOS BY OPTION, INCLUSIVE OF ALL CONTROL FUNCTIONS:
 There are no test case scenarios for this patch.
  
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
 Laboratory Electronic Data Interchange (LEDI) IV introduces enhancements
 to the bi-directional interface that allows Department of Veterans Affairs
 (VA) laboratories to communicate with other VA facilities, Commercial
 Reference Laboratories, and Department of Defense (DoD) labs, and sets the
 foundation for future communication of Anatomic Pathology (AP) and
 Microbiology (Micro) orders and results.
  
 Note 1: The functionality to electronically transmit AP orders and AP and
         Micro results are not being made available with this patch.
  
 Note 2: This patch is one of the patches in the LEDI IV project. The other
         patches are: HDI*1.0*7 and LR*5.2*350. Because this is a
         multi-package project, there is a multi-package host build that
         installs the following builds: HDI*1.0*7, LR*5.2*350, and
         LA*5.2*74.
  
 The software has the capacity and features necessary for sharing secure,
 encrypted laboratory data between VA to VA, VA to Commercial Reference
 Laboratories, and VA to DoD Labs. The LEDI IV software is an extension
 of the LEDI III software, and enhances the general LEDI III functionality.
  
  
 Enhancements
 ============
  
 1. The option 'Display Lab Universal Interface Message' [LA7 PRINT LAB UI
    MESSAGE] was modified so large Health Level 7 International (HL7)
    component fields display correctly.
   
 2. Users can now specify their default settings for the prompts "Parse 
    message fields based on HL7 segments?" and "Use Browser to display
    message(s)?" These settings are accessible via the menu option General 
    Lab User Parameters [LR USER PARAM].
  
 3. The option 'Reprocess Lab HL7 Messages' [LA7 REPROCESS HL7 MESSAGES]
    has been created to allow reprocessing of selected incoming Lab HL7
    messages. Messages should be of type (I)ncoming, have a status of
    (X)purgable, (E)rror, or (Q)ueued for processing, and be related to a
    message configuration type of LAB UI or LEDI. Messages for other
    configuration types should not be reprocessed at this time.

 Software and Documentation Retrieval Information
 ================================================
  
 The LEDI IV patch will be controlled by a phased release. To control the
 implementation of the LEDI IV patch and related SNOMED CT files, a secured
 File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server with passwords will be used. A member
 of the Product Development team will contact your site with the FTP 
 server, username, and password prior to your scheduled installation date.
  
 Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user and installation
 documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially
 released and the phased implementations start. This will give sites the
 opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation
 date.
  
  
 Documentation is available for LEDI IV on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as
 follows:
         Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
         Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
         Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
 NOTE: The files listed below will be listed in each of the LEDI IV patches
       that are part of the LEDI IV bundle; they only need to be downloaded
       once.
