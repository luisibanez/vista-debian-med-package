Subject: UPDATE PROCEDURES FOR SNOMED CT LABORATORY MAPPINGS

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch is an information patch containing the procedures for updating
 the SNOMED CT (Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) 
 laboratory mappings.
  
 1. SNOMED CT codes are used in the Laboratory application and are mapped 
    to the following files: TOPOGRAPHY FIELD file (#61), ETIOLOGY FIELD
    file (#61.2), and COLLECTION SAMPLE file (#62). SNOMED CT mappings are
    local to each facility and may need to periodically be updated (for
    example, an update might be needed due to a site adding new entries to
    the above mentioned files, or if existing entries need to be mapped to
    new SNOMED CT codes). When an update is available for a site, Standards
    & Terminology Services (STS) will send an email to the Laboratory
    Information Manager (LIM) to notify the site that there is a new
    mapping file for them to download and process.
  
    It is the responsibility of local or regional Office of Information and
    Technology (OI&T) personnel (aka, Information Resource Management (IRM))
    to download the SNOMED CT mapping file for their facility. Communication
    needs to be in place  between OI&T and Laboratory Service with respect to
    the process and who will be installing this SNOMED CT file.
  
    The SNOMED CT mapping files are stored on the Hines Office of Information
    (OI) Field Office File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server, under the
    ANONYMOUS.LAB_SNOMED_CT directory.  This directory is NOT replicated to
    the Albany or Salt Lake City OI Field Office FTP servers.
  
   
        FTP server: ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
        Username:  anonymous
        Directory:  ANON$:[ANONYMOUS.LAB_SNOMED_CT]
        File Name*: SITEID_SCT_MM_DD_YY.TXT
              *For the file name, "SITEID" is your three digit site ID, and 
              "MM_DD_YY" is the date the file was created.
         Example: 581_SCT_07_04_13.txt
         Make sure you only download the file for your site.
  
 2. When an updated SNOMED CT mapping file is available, IRM staff will 
    need to FTP the file to an appropriate directory on the local Veterans
    Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
    server. Ensure the file is downloaded in the correct format (ASCII).
    IRM staff must communicate with the Laboratory Information Manager
    (LIM) to coordinate an acceptable time in which the update can be
    installed.
  
 3. The option Load SNOMED SCT Mapping [LA7S LOAD MAPPING SCT] will be 
    used to load and process the SNOMED CT mapping file after the file is
    downloaded to a local directory on the Vista system. This option should
    be run by IRM staff, because access to the directory level of a system
    is a security issue and access is usually limited to IRM personnel.
    (Note: for more information about this option, see the LEDI IV User Manual,
    section 5.3.20, entitled "Load SNOMED SCT Mapping [LA7S LOAD MAPPING SCT]").
  
 4. When running the option, the user will be prompted with the following
    prompts:
  
    a. "Host File Directory: xxxx$:[xxxx]//" - Enter the directory where 
       you downloaded the file to (Note: do not enter the file name here -
       just enter the directory name). 
  
    b. "Select FILE:" - Enter a double question mark ("??") to get a list
       of '.txt' files that are in the selected directory.
  
       Select FILE: 1// ??
  
             1  581_SCT_4_25_12.TXT;1
             2  581_SCT_6_25_13.TXT;1
             Select a file by number from the list
  
       The file to load can be selected by number reference.
  
    c. Processing Action:
  
       Select one of the following:
  
            0         Quit - no action
            1         Process SNOMED CT mappings directly
            2         Task processing SNOMED CT mappings
  
       Processing Action: 0//   
  
       Select option 1 to process the SNOMED CT mappings directly.

 5. After the SNOMED CT Mapping file is loaded, it should be deleted from 
    the local directory.
  
 6. In conjunction with this patch release, an updated mapping file is 
    being released for all sites. This file should be downloaded and loaded
    by IRM staff using the process outlined above.
   
    In the future, updated mapping files will be made available on a
    site-by-site basis. When a mapping file is ready for a site to load, 
    a member of the STS team will contact the site to notify them that a
    new mapping file is ready for them to download and process.
