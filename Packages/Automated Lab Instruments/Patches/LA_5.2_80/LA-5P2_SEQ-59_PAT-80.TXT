 Blood Bank Clearance
 ==================== 
 VISTA Laboratory Package patch LA*5.2*80 contains changes to software 
 controlled by VHA DIRECTIVE 2004-058, titled VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE. 
 Changes include: 
 File                            Field
 ====-------------------         =====
 LAB CODE MAPPING (#62.47)      SEQUENCE (#.001)         
                                 CONCEPT (#.01)

                                 SNOMED CT ID (#62.482,.02)
  
 All of the above changes have been reviewed by the VISTA Blood Bank 
 Developer and found to have no impact on the VISTA BLOOD BANK SOFTWARE 
 control functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch LA*5.2*80 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch LA*5.2*80 does not 
 alter or modify any software design safeguards or safety critical 
 elements functions.
  
 POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SITES: This patch contains changes to 0 routines and 
 2 files identified in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 
 2004-058, group B listing. The changes have no effect on Blood Bank 
 functionality or medical device control functions. There is no adverse 
 potential to sites.
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION: 
 There are no validation requirements by option
  
 MINIMAL TEST CASE SCENARIOS BY OPTION, INCLUSIVE OF ALL CONTROL FUNCTIONS:
 There are no test case scenarios by option
  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This patch addresses the following items related to LEDI IV:
   
 o On the second line of routine LA7SMU2A, it is missing a star before the
   patch number. This will be added by the patch.
  
 o The routine LAMIAUT4 was modified to ask for performing lab and to send
   Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) alerts when using the option 
   Verify Micro Auto Data [LA MI VERIFY AUTO].
  
 o This patch will make cosmetic changes to the Data Dictionary (e.g.,
   update Help-Prompts, Descriptions, etc.) for files LAB CODE MAPPING
   (#62.47) and LA7 MESSAGE PARAMETER (#62.48).
  
 o The functionality to electronically transmit AP orders and AP/Micro
   results via the LEDI interface was previously disabled by default for
   LEDI IV. This patch will now enable the functionality to electronically
   transmit AP Orders and Micro Results via LEDI. (Note: The functionality
   to transmit AP results will still be disabled).
  
 o When a Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) 
   mapping file is loaded, the system validates each SNOMED CT ID against
   the Lexicon. If there is an exception found (e.g., the code is inactive)
   the system sends an alert to Standards & Terminology Services (STS) so
   that STS can send an updated mapping for this entry. However, it is
   possible for a code to be active at the time of the load, but be
   deprecated when a Lexicon patch is installed that updates the SNOMED CT
   code set. To ensure the SCT mappings stay current, this patch creates a
   new option, 'Check SNOMED CT Mappings Against the Lexicon' [LA7TASK SCT
   MAPPINGS CHECK]. This option checks the SCT mappings against the Lexicon
   for exceptions, and should be scheduled to run on a recurring basis. If
   the option finds any exceptions:
  
   a. The SCT CODE STATUS field (#21) for the entry will be updated to
      'Error'
   b. A HDI exception alert will be sent to STS 
   c. A MailMan message will be sent to the G.LMI and G.LAB MESSAGING Mail
      Groups with a list of the exceptions found. (Note: When the members
      of the local mail groups receive the MailMan message with the list of
      exceptions found, they do not need to do anything. STS will review
      the exception alerts they receive, and if needed, will send an
      updated SCT mapping file to the site to load. Until STS notifies the
      site that there is an updated mapping file to load, there is nothing
      that the site needs to do)
  
 o This patch will fix an issue with how the system handles the following 
   situation. When an order is received by a host site via the LEDI 
   interface, the system tries to find a matching entry in the host's 
   shipping configuration based off the test and specimen codes that were 
   sent across in the HL7 message. In a scenario where it found a matching 
   test/specimen entry setup, but the specimen at the host site was mapped
   to a different SNOMED CT ID than the ordering site, then when creating
   the order, the system was not using the specimen that was configured on
   the shipping configuration, but instead, would use a specimen that
   matched the SNOMED CT ID from the message. If the host site did not have
   an existing entry that matched the SNOMED CT ID from the message, the
   system automatically created a new entry based off the SNOMED CT
   information from the message and used that new specimen for the order.
   This patch changes this functionality, so that in this scenario, the
   host site rejects the order with an HL7 Application Error (AE). The
   collecting site would then need to change their test configuration to
   make sure that the specimen and collection samples they are using are
   mapped to the same SNOMED CT ID as the host site.
  
    NOTE
    ====
    Due to this change, after a LEDI Host site installs this patch, they
    might start seeing Application Errors (AEs) being generated for
    incoming HL7 orders. If this occurs, notify the collecting site. The
    collecting site will need to ensure that the specimen and collection
    samples they are using are correctly mapped to the same SNOMED CT ID at
    the host site.
  
 o This patch will update the file #62.47 mapping to remove LOINC code 
   22638-1 from the SP COMMENT concept and add it to SP GROSS DESCRIPTION,
   CY GROSS DESCRIPTION, and EM GROSS DESCRIPTION.  LOINC code 24419-4 will
   also be added to the CY GROSS DESCRIPTION and EM GROSS DESCRIPTION
   concepts.
  
 o When an HL7 ORU (Observational report - Unsolicited) message is
   generated for an AP result, the fourth component (body site) in OBR-15
   (Specimen source) was not being populated. Similarly, for a
   mycobacteriology result, OBR-32 (Principal result interpreter) was not
   being populated. These issues have been fixed with this patch.
  
 o When an HL7 ORU (Observational report - Unsolicited) message is
   generated for a Micro result, an incorrect field number is being
   referenced so the PARASITOLOGY SMEAR/PREP field (#15.51) of the
   MICROBIOLOGY sub-file (#5) for the LAB DATA file (#63) is not populated
   and sent.  This issue has been fixed with this patch.
  
 o This patch will hard code it so that Micro and AP results returned via
   the LEDI interface will never overlay previous results for this
   accession in the ^LAH global.
  
 o Microbiology sterility results being returned by a LEDI host site were 
   not filing in the LAH global on the collecting site. This patch will add
   filing logic for sterility results.

 Remedy Tickets Overview
 =======================
   
 1. INC000000852585 - Error with option LA DOWN
   
    Problem
    -------
    Sometimes when a user runs option Download a load list to an Instrument
    [LA DOWN], the option generates an error in the VistA error trap and
    does not download the load list to the instrument. The issue is caused
    because patch LA*5.2*74 modified routine LA7ADL to change how variable
    LA761 was set. It moved this action from CHKTEST^LA7ADL to UID^LA7ADL.
    Routine LA7UIO is used by the option LA DOWN, and it calls
    CHKTEST^LA7ADL at CUP+20. Since it enters at CHKTEST, LA761 has not
    been set causing the undefined error.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Modified CUP^LA7UIO to set variable LA761 before calling 
    CHKTEST^LA7ADL.
   
    Routine: LA7UIO
