Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). The VA NHIN Gateway Adapter uses a 
service-oriented architecture (SOA) to share patient health data and to 
communicate between systems.

Release of VA NATIONAL HEALTH INFO NETWORK (NHIN) (Version 1.0) - October 
28, 2010
 
RELEASE INFORMATION:
====================
The NHIN RPC Package (NHIN 1.0) will be used with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) Nationwide Health Information Network (NHIN) 
Gateway Adapter Version 2.0. The purpose of the VA NHIN Gateway Adapter 
is to implement the actions necessary to exchange electronic health 
records (EHRs) generated from the VA and received from authorized NHIN 
Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). The VA NHIN Gateway Adapter uses a 
service-oriented architecture (SOA) to share patient health data and to 
communicate between systems.
 
The VA NHIN Adapter interfaces with the VA NHIN CONNECT Gateway, which is 
an implemented instance of the Federal CONNECT Gateway software. The 
Federal NHIN CONNECT Gateway is the product deliverable of the Federal 
Health Architecture (FHA), under the Department of Health and Human 
Services (HSS). This product is the result of the collaboration and 
shared development cost of a group of more than twenty government 
agencies known as the Federal Consortium. The VA has been exchanging 
medical information with the Department of Defense (DoD) for several 
years. By using the VA CONNECT Gateway together with the VA NHIN Adapter, 
the VA will now be able to share patient health data with other federal 
partners, as well as private providers, such as Kaiser Permanente.
 
The VA NHIN Gateway Adapter is a HealtheVet-VistA application that acts 
as a gateway between the VA and other Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) 
to share patient clinical records. The VA NHIN Gateway Adapter is 
deployed as a single, national instance at AITC (Austin Information 
Technology Center). Payloads are standards-based CDA (Clinical Document 
Architecture) XML documents. VistA data is retrieved through the use of 
VistALink-mediated RPC calls; HIE data retrieved by the NHIN Adapter is 
displayed by VistAWeb. The NHIN Adapter provides a read-only service: it 
does not create a clinical repository with the data it mediates.
 
SOFTWARE CHANGES:

This package release of NHIN Version 1.0 will add the following VistA 
file entries:
 
        NHIN APPLICATION PROXY to the OPTION file (#19).
        NHIN GET VISTA DATA to the REMOTE PROCEDURE FILE (#8994).
 
The post-install routine will create a new proxy user in the NEW PERSON 
file (#200).  The user name will be NHIN,APPLICATION PROXY.

MANDATE: 
=========
Installation of the NHIN RPC Package (NHIN V1.0) supports VA compliance 
with Executive Order 13410 "Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care 
in Federal Government Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs".  
The NHIN RPC Package enhances the data elements that can be exchanged 
among HIEs, which is foundational to VA meeting the President's goal of 
development of the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER), an open 
architecture, non-proprietary, standards-based approach to exchange of 
health care information.  
 
Sites are mandated to install this KIDS build to support NHIN-related 
efforts.  Due to the high visibility of this project, at the VA Secretary 
and White House levels, the compliance date for installing this KIDS 
build has been set at 14 days.
 
M COMPONENT COMPLIANCE DATE:
=============================
       November 12, 2010  
 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
=======================
 
If you have any questions concerning the installation or implementation 
of this package, please call the VA Service Desk at 1-888-596-HELP (4357) 
or log a Remedy Ticket for NHIN:   Category =

VISTAWEB V. 12 versus V. 13:
============================
 
Installation of the NHIN RPC Package at all 129 VistA systems is the 
first step in completing a national delivery of NHIN.  Only the 
clinicians at the sites that have Initial Operating Capability (IOC) 
approval for installing VistAWeb Version 13 will have access to NHIN data 
when the RPC package is installed.  (IOC sites include:  San Diego, 
Hampton, East Orange, North Chicago and Puget Sound)  Clinicians at the 
remaining VA Medical Centers will not have access to NHIN data until 
VistAWeb Version 13 (WEBV*1.0*20) is nationally released, tentatively 
scheduled for early-  to mid-November 2010.
