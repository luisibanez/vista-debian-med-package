Description:
============

 Patch PSD*3.0*71 addresses two (2) issues.
  
 1. The recently released patch PSD*3*69 introduced a new key PSD TECH ADV,
    intended to allow a Controlled Substances technician access to some of
    the Pharmacist's menu as described in the PSD*3*69 patch description. 
    Some users have expressed concerns related to the Outpatient Rx's [PSD
    OUTPATIENT] option because the new PSD TECH ADV key was supposed to allow
    the posting of the transaction but not allow the release of the 
    prescription. This patch will now allow a holder of the PSD TECH ADV key
    to perform all the functionalities of the Outpatient Rx's [PSD OUTPATIENT]
    option EXCEPT releasing prescriptions.
   
 2. The use of the PSD TECH ADV key was extended to grant its holder access
    to the options listed below. These options are available on the 
    Technician (CS Pharmacy) Menu [PSD PHARM TECH].
   
       Complete Green Sheet [PSD COMPLETE GS]
       Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DEST DRUGS REPORT]
       DEA Form 41 Destroyed Drugs Report [PSD DESTROY DEA41]
       Destructions Holding Report [PSD DESTRUCTION HOLDING]
       Add Existing Green Sheets at Setup [PSD EXISTING GS]
       Green Sheet Transfer Between NAOUs Report [PSD GS TRANSFER (NAOU) REPORT] 
       Transfer Drugs between Dispensing Sites [PSD TRANSFER VAULT DRUGS]
   
    Once the patch is installed, the options on the Technician (CS Pharmacy) 
    Menu [PSD PHARM TECH] will be similar to the list below.
  
      Select Technician (CS Pharmacy) Menu Option: 
  
              Print CS Dispensing Worksheet
              Fill/Dispense CS Orders from Worksheet
