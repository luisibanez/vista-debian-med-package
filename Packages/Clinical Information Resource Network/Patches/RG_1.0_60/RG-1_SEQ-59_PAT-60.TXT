Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ISSUES - ITERATION 10

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  DG*5.3*863, RG*1.0*46, RG*1.0*55, and RG*1.0*59 are required builds
  for patch RG*1*60.
   
  NOTE: Patches DG*5.3*863, RG*1*60, and MPIF*1*57 are being released
  together.  It is recommended that all three patches be installed on
  the same date if possible.  Each patch contains functionality related
  to the display of the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  All
  three patches must be in place nationally for the full ICN to display
  in all of the stated options.
   
  Issue #1
  The Display Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] option
  will now display the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  The full
  ICN includes the PATIENT (#2) file INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER
  (991.01) field, followed by a "V", followed by the ICN CHECKSUM
  (991.02) field, and is derived by calling the GETICN^MPIF001 API.
   
  Issue #2
  To address Remedy ticket HD0000000459245, a code change has been
  made in routine RGADTP.  The RG ADT-A08 TRIGGER subscriber protocol
  is on the VAFC ADT-A08 SERVER protocol.  When it calls routine RGADTP,
  the DFN variable is known to exist.  However, in some cases, other
  applications' subscriber protocols may not have the DFN variable defined.
  To prevent an undefined error at ROUTE+8^RGADTP, a check has been added
  to only set the ^XTMP global when DFN is defined.
    
  Issue #3
  An obsolete report will be removed from the Management Reports [RG MGT
  REPORTS] menu.  The National ICN Statistics [RG NATIONAL ICN STATISTICS]
  report was used during the initial set up process and is no longer needed.
    
  Issue #4
  Changes have been made to the Patient Audit File Print [RGMT AUDIT
  PRINT] and Single Patient Audit File Print [RGMT AUDIT SINGLE] options
  on the Patient Audit Log Reports [RG TRAN/AUD AUD REP] menu.  ALIAS data
  was not displayed on these reports because the process did not handle
  multiple field values from the AUDIT (#1.1) file.  Multiples are stored
  differently in the AUDIT global.  Modifications have been made to
  display the AUDIT data for multiple subfields within the PATIENT
  (#2) file, specifically the ALIAS (2.01) subfield, ALIAS (.01) and
  ALIAS SSN (1) fields.
          
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patches DG*5.3*863,
  MPIF*1.0*57, and RG*1.0*60.  Facilities should download the revised
  documentation listed as follows:
  
      User Manual                         RG1_0_UM.PDF
      Technical Manual                    RG1_0_TM.PDF
      Exception Handling                  RG1_0_EH.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
