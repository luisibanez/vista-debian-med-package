Subject: MESSAGING ENHANCEMENTS FOR NEW FIELDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*47, RG*1.0*48, RG*1.0*57, RG*1.0*58, and DG*5.3*837 are
  required builds for patch RG*1*59.
   
  The messaging enhancements for new fields are being distributed in
  three VistA namespaces.  The patches should be installed in this
  order: DG*5.3*837, RG*1.0*59, and MPIF*1.0*54.  After installing
  DG*5.3*837, it is not necessary to wait for the data conversion
  completion bulletin to move on with installing RG*1.0*59.  It is
  recommended that these three patches be installed within a short
  time window.
   
  Issue #1: Duplicate Primary View Reject Exceptions
  It was recommended in VistA patch RG*1*48 that facilities schedule
  the MPI/PD Exception Purge [RG EXCEPTION PURGE] option to run hourly.
  In the event that the job is not scheduled, then whenever a user
  enters the MPI/PD Exception Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option,
  the Exception Purge will run.  That job removes duplicate exceptions
  for the same exception TYPE and PATIENT, keeping the most recent
  exception.
  
  However, once the Exception Purge has run, it does not run again for
  an hour.  During that timeframe, if multiple Primary View Reject (234)
  exceptions occur for the same patient, an exception is created for
  each of these occurrences.  HC IdM requested that duplicate Primary
  View Reject (234) exceptions not be created on VistA.  A code change
  has been made to routine RGHLLOG to check if there is an existing
  exception with an EXCEPTION STATUS of NOT PROCESSED.  If there is an
  active exception for the exception TYPE and PATIENT, then a new
  exception is not created.
   
  The user can review the history of rejected edits by using the
  "PVR View PV Rej Detail" action item within the MPI/PD Exception
  Handling [RG EXCEPTION HANDLING] option for a selected exception.
   
  Issue #2: Enhancement to the HL7 v2.4 PID Processor
  Using Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging, patient identification
  information is transmitted in the Patient Identification (PID)
  segment.  The VistA HL7 v2.4 PID processor has been enhanced to
  extract the TEMPORARY ID NUMBER and the FOREIGN ID NUMBER from the
  PID segment.  The values are placed in ARRAY("TIN") and ARRAY("FIN"),
  respectively.  If the value is equal to two double quotes (""), then
  the corresponding ARRAY node is set to @.
   
  Issue #3: Enhancement to Patient Update Messaging
  Routines RGADTP2 and RGADTP3 have been modified to examine incoming
  data for TEMPORARY ID NUMBER and FOREIGN ID NUMBER and set the
  appropriate array values.  Then the HL7 v2.4 patient update API is
  called in routine VAFCPTED to update the PATIENT (#2) file.
  (Note: The VAFCPTED routine is being updated in patch DG*5.3*837.)
      
  Issue #4: Prevent Non-Enumerated Record from Updating a More Recent
  Record during the Linking to the New Record
  When an "old" (non-enumerated) record was edited on VistA, it could
  potentially influence Primary View for that record on the MPI, and
  thus update a more recent patient record.  Healthcare Identity
  Management (HC IdM) requests that this scenario be prevented.
    
  When facilities were originally enumerated and records in the PATIENT
  (#2) file were seeded with Integration Control Numbers (ICN), all
  records in the file were not enumerated - only records that were active
  during a three-year time span were enumerated.  Patients added/edited
  after the original seeding also get ICNs.  Therefore, there are old
  records in the PATIENT (#2) file without ICNs.
    
  To prevent an old non-enumerated record from updating a more recent
  record, two VistA patches (RG*1.0*59 and MPIF*1.0*54) and one Master
  Veteran Index patch (MPI*1.0*90) will be issued.  These three patches
  make the following changes:
    
  RG*1.0*59 (this patch)
  ----------------------
  - The A08 message builder has been enhanced to check whether ^XTMP("MPIF
    OLD RECORDS",dfn) is defined.  If it is, the record is considered old,
    and the A08 message builder includes an OBX segment in the message:
           OBX^^CE^OLDER RECORD^^Y
    
  - The A08 application acknowledgment processor has been enhanced to kill
    the "old" record designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn), since if
    the traits happen to be the same on the Primary View, no subsequent A31
    synchronization message will be sent.  Since the Primary View and the
    patient record are in sync, the "old" record designation can be removed,
    and subsequent updates to this record are allowed to update the Primary
    View.
      
  - The A31 message processor has been enhanced to kill the "old" record
    designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn).  If the MPI sends an update
    message, the VistA record and the Primary View are in sync, and the
    "old" record designation can be removed.
      
  MPIF*1.0*54
  -----------
  - The enumeration builder, remote procedure MPIF REMOTE LOCAL ICN
    ASSIGN, has been enhanced to set the ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn)
    global, if the record with that DFN has no ICN assigned and is not in
    the ^DPT("AMPIMIS",dfn) index indicating it is in the process of being
    assigned an ICN.
    
  - The A31 message builder has been enhanced to check whether ^XTMP("MPIF
    OLD RECORDS",dfn) is defined.  If it is, the record is considered old,
    and the A31 message builder includes an OBX segment in the message:
           OBX^^CE^OLDER RECORD^^Y
          
  - The A31 application acknowledgment processor has been enhanced to kill
    the "old" record designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn), since if
    the traits happen to be the same on the Primary View, no subsequent
    A31 synchronization message will be sent.  Since the Primary View and
    the patient record are in sync, the "old" record designation can be
    removed, and subsequent updates to this record are allowed to update
    the Primary View.
     
  MPI*1.0*90 (patch is ONLY installed on the MPI)
  -----------------------------------------------
  - The patch will check whether the incoming A31 or A08 message contains
    an OBX segment marking the record as "old".  If it does, then the
    authority score for the patient will be considered -1, and thus not
    influence the Primary View.
