Associated patches: (v)RG*1*54     <<= must be installed BEFORE `RG*1*58'

Subject: VISTA UPDATE CAN ERROR WHEN CMOR FIELD IS NULL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  RG*1.0*54 is a required build for patch RG*1*58.
   
  Issue #1
  When the Healthcare Identity Management (HC IdM) team uses the MPI
  Override Primary View Values [MPI DATA MGT PRIM VW OVERRIDE] option to
  update identity fields in the MPI VETERAN/ CLIENT (#985) file, those
  updates are sent to the associated VistA site(s) via Health Level 7
  (HL7) messaging.  If the COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD (#991.03) field
  in the PATIENT (#2) file for that site record is null, then a SUBSCRIPT
  error at NS+1^XUAF4 could occur at the site.  Even though the
  COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD (#991.03) field is no longer used, it is
  usually populated.  The processing code in routine RGADTP2 has been
  modified to address instances when the COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD
  (#991.03) field is null.  The code change will prevent an error when
  routine ^XUAF4 is called.
