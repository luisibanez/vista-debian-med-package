Subject: UPDATE FOR UNSUPPORTED ICD FIELD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) have been created to facilitate
 the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
 Edition (ICD10) project.  These APIs replace direct global reads to
 unsupported fields in the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file.  This patch will use
 these APIs in order to obtain information from the file instead of
 performing a direct read of the ICD9 global.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 INC0000000610903 IN A SLC GOLD VISTA ACCOUNT A NUMBER OF AICS ROUTINES
                  WERE FOUND TO HAVE UNSUPPORTED DIRECT GLOBAL READS TO THE
                  DIAGNOSIS FIELD.  
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    Direct global reads to the DIAGNOSIS (#3) and DESCRIPTION (#10) fields
    in the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) are not supported and need to be
    replaced for the software to function properly.  Global reads to a
    cross reference between an ICD9 code and its internal entry number
    within ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) also need to be replaced. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The DIAGNOSIS (#3) and DESCRIPTION (#10) fields contained an  
    unsupported direct global read.  These unsupported reads were replaced 
    with supported methods to retrieve the data.
    
    Technical:
    ----------
    Routine ^IBDFN4 will be modified to replace the direct global read 
    with a call to API $$ICDDX^ICDCODE in order to obtain the correct
    DIAGNOSIS (#3) field value. The API $$ICDD^ICDCODE will replace a
    second direct global read in order to obtain the correct DESCRIPTION
    (#10) field value.
  
    In addition, routine ^IBDFN7 will be modified to replace a cross
    reference between the ICD9 code and the corresponding internal entry
    number within the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80). This modification will use
    the API $$CODEN^ICDCODE.  These API calls are defined in Integration
    Control Registration #3990.
