Subject: CORRECTIONS TO OUTPATIENT MEALS AND FOOD PREFERENCES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
 1. Food preferences without an associated meal will generate an 
 error in the Patient Profile for inpatients. 
 2. Currently, there are 3 issues occurring when ordering meals for 
 outpatients:  
   a) The user is allowed to order Recurring Meals for deceased outpatients
   b) The user is allowed to order Special Meals for deceased outpatients
   c) The user is allowed to order Guest Meals for deceased outpatients
 3. The GMR ALLERGIES field (#25) is not available in the Enter/Edit Food
 Preferences option [FHSEL1] when manually entering or editing a food
 preference labeled as an allergy. Additionally, XINDEX is returning a SAC
 violation in routine FHSEL1 for having a lock command without a time out.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000373581 - No meals were attached to the food preference.
  
   Problem:
   --------
   It is possible for a food preference to not have a meal associated
   with it. This will cause the Patient Profile [FHORD9] to generate
   an on screen error for inpatients. This type of error will cause the
   user to be forced out of VistA.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify routine FHORD6 to check for a food preference for an
   associated meal. If no meal is associated with the food preference, the
   routine will assume the food preference is for all meals.
  
 2. HD0000000374390 - Outpatient Meal Issue
  
   Problem A:
   ----------
   The Order/Edit Outpatient Meals option [FHOMRO] in the Recurring Meals
   Menu [FHOMRMGR] will allow the user to order recurring meals for a
   deceased outpatient. 
  
   Resolution A:
   -----------
   Modify routines FHOMRO1 and FHOMDPA to determine if the outpatient has
   a date of death on file. If the outpatient has a date of death 
   on file, the user will be presented with a message that the outpatient
   has died. The user will be prevented from ordering a recurring meal for
   a deceased outpatient.
  
   Problem B:
   ----------
   The Request a Meal option [FHOMSR] in the Special Meals Menu [FHOMSMGR]
   will allow the user to order a special meal for a deceased outpatient.
   
   Resolution B:
   -----------
   Modify routines FHOMSR1 and FHOMDPA to determine if the outpatient 
   has a date of death on file. If the outpatient has a date of death on 
   file, the user will be presented with a message that the outpatient has
   died.  The user will be prevented from ordering a special meal for a
   deceased outpatient.
  
   Problem C:
   ----------
   The Request a Meal option [FHOMGR] in the Guest Meals Menu [FHOMGMGR]
   will allow the user to order a guest meal for a deceased outpatient.
   
   Resolution C:
   -----------
   Modify routines FHOMGR1 and FHOMDPA to determine if the outpatient 
   has a date of death on file. If the outpatient has a date of death on 
   file, the user will be presented with a message that the outpatient has
   died.  The user will be prevented from ordering a guest meal for a  
   deceased outpatient.
  
  
 3. HD0000000382741 - FGH - Food Prefs Manual Link to GMR ALLERGIES field
  
   Problem A:
   ----------
   The user is able to manually enter or edit a food preference labeled as 
   an allergy using the Enter/Edit Food Preference [FHSEL1] option. The 
   GMR ALLERGIES field (#25) is not available to the user when using this
   option to manually enter or edit a food preference labeled as an
   allergy.
   
   Resolution A:
   -------------
   Modification of routine FHSEL1 to present the GMR ALLERGIES field (#25)
   to the user during the manual entry or edit of a food preference labeled
   as an allergy.
   
  
   Problem B:
   ----------
   XINDEX returned a SAC violation in routine FHSEL1 for having a LOCK 
   command without having a time out.
   
   Resolution B:
   -----------
   Modify routine FHSEL1 to have a timeout with the LOCK command.
