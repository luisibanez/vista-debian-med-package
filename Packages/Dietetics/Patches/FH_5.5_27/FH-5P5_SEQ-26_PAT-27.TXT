Subject: CORRECT ISSUE WITH TICKLERS & ALERTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
 1. Ticklers are not displaying correctly for Nursing Home patients with an
 (ASIH) "Absent Sick in Hospital" episode. 
  
 2. When the List Inpats By Nutrition Status Level [FHASNR4] report option
 is executed and the sorting is done by CLINICIAN, it is using the old
 CLINICIAN field (#1) rather than the new CLINICIAN(S) field (#112).
 This causes the report to produce incorrect information.
  
 3. When a patient is transferred to another ward, routine FHWTRN is 
 invoked to determine if monitors and related ticklers should be filed 
 for the patient.  Currently, alerts are being issued to the incorrect 
 Clinician.  
  
 4. XINDEX error is being generated for routine FHWTRN, which is a SACC 
 VIOLATION.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD0000000242092 - FGH - Tickler doesn't seem to be working on one 
     patient.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Nursing home patients who get very ill are admitted to the hospital
     using the "Absent Sick In Hospital" (ASIH) transfer method. Once
     the nursing home patient is well, he is discharged from hospital and
     is re-admitted to the nursing home using the original nursing home
     admission record. This becomes the patient's current admission. This
     will cause any monitor and its related tickler to be associated to the
     wrong admission when filed. The Display Tickler [FHCTF1] option will
     check the admission associated with the tickler with the patient's
     current admission. If they do not match, the tickler record is deleted
     before the report is displayed to the clinician. For the nursing
     home patients who have been ASIH, the tickler will appear to have 
     stopped working for them.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine to maintain the correct admission.
  
 2.  HD0000000426656 - List Inpats By Nutrition Status Level [FHASNR4]
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The List Inpats By Nutrition Status Level [FHASNR4] option creates
     a report for a selected nutrition status level. The user is 
     prompted to select sorting the results by either ward or clinician.
     When the user selects to sort the results by clinician, the
     results are being sorted by the depreciated CLINICIAN field (#1)
     rather than the new CLINICIAN(S) field (#112) of the NUTRITION
     LOCATION file (#119.6). The report is incorrect and incomplete.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify the report to use the CLINICIAN(S) field (#112) for sorting.
  
 3.  HD0000000430806 - clinician receiving alert
    
     Problem:
     --------
     When a patient is transferred from one nutrition location to another,
     the monitors will be checked. If needed, a monitor and tickler will be
     filed for the patient during the transfer. If the options to issue
     alerts for the monitors are turned on the alerts will be issued to the
     clinician. This process is using the depreciated CLINICIAN field (#1)
     rather than the new CLINICIAN(S) field (#112) of the NUTRITION
     LOCATION file (#119.6). This is causing ticklers to be filed to the
     wrong clinician. Alerts are being sent to the wrong clinician and to
     the correct clinicians with the wrong clinician name. 
     Also, for sites adding new nutrition locations this will cause a
     error and force the user out of VistA.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify the process to use the new CLINICIAN(S) field (#112).
   
 4.  HD0000000441565 - XINDEX returned no time out on LOCK command error 
     for routine FHWTRN
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Running the XINDEX for routine FHWTRN returned the following error:
     Compiled list of Errors and Warnings     Nov 03, 2010@17:13:49 page 1
  
     FHWTRN   * *  142 Lines,  6349 Bytes, Checksum: B35702761

     --- Routine Detail ---
     *****   ERRORS & WARNINGS IN FHWTRN   *****
     TFIL+1       S - Lock missing Timeout.
  
     The missing time out violates the SACC section 2.4.6.1 which states 
     that all incremental locks must have a timeout. 
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modification of routine FHWTRN at TFIL+1 to include a time out on the 
     LOCK command.
