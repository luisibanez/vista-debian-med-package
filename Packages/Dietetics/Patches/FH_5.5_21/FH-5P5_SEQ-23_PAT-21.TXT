 1. HD0000000267395 - Incorrect target weight
 Problem:
 --------
 During the entry of the Nutrition Assessment, the user is presented with

 Modification will be made to routine FHASMB2 to present the user with 
 the correct message and correct target weight.
  
 2. HD0000000305078 - Diet Labels Not Printing 'NO ORDER'
 Problem:
 --------
 When displaying or printing a Diet Order Label, the "NO ORDER" notation 
 in the Diet Order field is not printing.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of routine FHWADM to properly complete the admission in the
 NUTRITION PERSON file (#115) when the patient has been assigned a 
 room-bed not mapped to a ward that he/she is admitted to.
  
 3. HD0000000325990 - No integration agreement
 Problem:
