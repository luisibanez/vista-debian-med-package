 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000529281 - stack error when using Create/Map Food Preferences 
                      to Allergies [FHSELA]
  
     Problem:
     --------
     In the option Create/Map Food Preferences [FHSELA] the user is 
     prompted "Do you want to import Recipes from another Food Preference?
     N //". If the user answers Y for yes to this prompt, the user is then
     prompted "Select FOOD PREFERENCES NAME:". If the user decides to not
     answer this prompt and hits the enter key to enter a null value or
     enters a "^" to continue an undefined variable error is generated that
     will cause the option FHSELA crash. The crash will force the user out
     of VistA.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine FHSEL1 to properly handle being called by routine 
     FHSELA1. 
  
 2. HD0000000601034 - Issues with patch FH*5.5*24
  
     Problem:
     --------
     A patient can have a food preference without an associated meal. This 
     food preference without an associated meal is not listed in the
     Display Patient Preferences option [FHSEL4] for that patient.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The option Display Patient Preferences option [FHSEL4] calls routine
     FHSEL1 to display the patient's food preferences. Routine FHSEL1 is
     currently coded to check a food preference for an associated meal. If 
     it does not find one it will not print that food preference. Routine
     FHSEL1 will be changed to check a food preference for an associated
     meal. If the food preference does not have an associated meal, routine
     FHSEL1 will assume that it is to be associated with all meals and
     print that food preference.
