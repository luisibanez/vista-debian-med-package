 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000608148 - printing patient profile, shows global reference 
                      before age.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When printing the Patient Profile option [FHORD9] for an inpatient the
     patient's sex will either print part of the raw global data stored for
     the patient in the PATIENT file (#2) or print a null value for the
     patient's sex.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The Patient Profile option [FHORD9] calls routine FHORD6. Routine
     FHORD6 has a bug in it that tells it to pull data that follows this
     set of characters "GH^". If it does not find anything that matches it
     will print a null value for the patient's sex. If it does, then it
     will print whatever it finds after that string of characters. Routine
     FHORD6 will corrected to pull the patient's sex from the SEX field
     (#.02) from the PATIENT file (#2) when the Patient Profile option
     [FHORD9] is run for an inpatient.
