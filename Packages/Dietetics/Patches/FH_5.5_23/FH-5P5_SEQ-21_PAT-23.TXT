 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000317642 - patient food allergy not mapping to N&FS food 
    preferences
  
   Problem:
   --------
   
 The Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies [FHSELA] option 
 displays a list of all available food allergies that have not been 
 previously mapped.  The available list of food allergies can be 
 displayed using the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) but the list of food 
 allergies displayed in the Create/Map Food Preference to Allergies is
 presented using the hard coded list contained within routine FHSELA2.
 The twelve new food allergies listed below were previously added
 to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) but the hard coded list was not
 updated with the same food allergies.  Therefore, an incomplete list of 
 food allergies is presented to the user.  
  
 The following food allergies were previously added to the GMR ALLERGIES
 file (#120.82) using the New Term Rapid Turnaround (NTRT) push:
   1.    Arugula
   2.    Capers
   3.    Curry
   4.    Gooseberries
   5.    Meat Tenderizer
   6.    Olestra
   7.    Orange Dye
   8.    Pomegranates
   9.    Pudding
   10.   Saffron
   11.   Stevia
   12.   Water Chestnuts
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine FHSELA2 will be modified to display the twelve new food
 allergies that were added to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82)
 so that the user can select the food allergies for mapping. To complete 
 this process upon installation, sites must manually "map" the food 
 allergy to the Food Preference file in the N&FS package.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 The option Create/Map Food Preferences to Allergies [FHSELA] calls 
 routines FHSELA1 and FHSELA2 to map the allergies. FHSELA2 creates a 
 worklist of all food allergies.  FHSELA1 takes that work list and removes 
 foods that have been previously mapped to allergies and presents the 
 unmapped allergies to the user.  FHSELA1 handles the user's input and 
 performs the mapping of the food preference to allergy.
  
 Routine FHSELA2 does not read the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) and
 dynamically create a work list of all food allergies. It uses the hard
 coded allergies listed in the routine FHSELA2.    
 The additions to the new GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82) are not carried
 over in the work list routine.  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

 Nutrition and Food Service users are off the system.  Other VISTA users
