Associated patches: (v)FH*5.5*24   <<= must be installed BEFORE `FH*5.5*31'

Subject: CORRECT ISSUES WITH PATIENT LOOKUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
 1. An undefined variable error in routine FHOMDPA is causing the user to
    be forced out of VistA.
  
 2. A patient with a "Death Node" (^DPT(DFN,.351)) without a date of death 
    will cause routine FHOMDPA to fail when executing a record lookup of
    that patient.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD0000000597397 - <UNDEFINED>DEAD+8^FHOMDPA
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     A deceased patient whose internal file record number in the NUTRITION 
     PERSON file (#115), known as the FHDFN, does not match the
     internal file record number in the PATIENT file (#2), known as 
     the DFN, will generate an error during the patient look up in the 
     Nutrition and Food Service (N&FS) package. The patient lookup should 
     alert the user that the patient has died and display the date of
     death. When the FHDFN and the DFN do not match, the display variable
     with the patient's name is not set. This will generate an undefined
     variable error which causes the user to be forced out of VistA.
     
     RESOLUTION:
     -----------
     The method used to get the patient's name has been changed when 
     displaying the status of the deceased patient message.  Routine 
     FHOMDPA will no longer assume the patient's DFN and FHDFN will match.
     The patient's DFN will be used to pull the patient's name from the
     PATIENT file (#2) to display the message:
     "This patient, XXXX,XXXX, died on MM/DD/YY."
     
 2.  HD0000000599578 - FH*5.5*24 Issues
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     A patient in the PATIENT file (#2) can have a date of death 
     entered in error. This will populate DATE OF DEATH field (#.351) and
     other fields in the "Death" node, ^DPT(DFN,.35). When the
     date of death is deleted, the node, ^DPT(DFN,.35), in the Patient 
     file(#2) will still be present with an empty DATE OF DEATH field 
     A patient with a ^DPT(DFN,.35) node with a null DATE OF DEATH field
     will cause the option to fail without error and simply return
     the user to either the lookup prompt or exit the option to return to
     the menu.
  
     RESOLUTION:
     -----------
     The original code was for the FHOMDPA to test for the ^DPT(DFN,.35) 
     node in the patient record. If this node existed it would then execute
     the code to display a message that the patient has died and then quit
     the lookup and return user to the previous menu.  
     The code has been changed to test for a date of death in the node not
     just for the node existence. If the patient has a date of death 
     entered, the code will be executed to display the following message. 
        "This patient, XXXX,XXXX, died on MM/DD/YY." 
     If the patient does not have a date of death the code will continue
     with the look up of the matching record in the NUTRITION PERSON file.
  
 =================== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =====================
   
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.  Users may be on the system.
   
     1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.

     3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter FH*5.5*31)
   
        a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
   
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
           DDs, templates, etc.).
   
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
           the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
   
     4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package FH*5.5*31
