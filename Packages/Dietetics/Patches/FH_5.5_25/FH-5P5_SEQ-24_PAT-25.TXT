 This patch addresses the following issues:
 1. The Barbeque Sauce allergy dislike food preference is not mapping
    to the Barbecue Sauce food allergy in the GMR Allergies file.
 2. The Eggs, Substitutes allergy dislike food preference is not 
    mapping to the EGG SUBSTITUTES food allergy in the GMR Allergies file.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000376181 - FGH - Allergy not showing for pt food preferences
  
   Problem 1:
   --------
   The BARBEQUE SAUCE allergy dislike food preference will not map to the
   BARBECUE SAUCE food allergy in the GMR ALLERGIES file.
   
   Resolution 1:
   -------------
   Modify routine FHSELA2 to map the BARBEQUE SAUCE allergy dislike food
   preference to the BARBECUE SAUCE food allergy in the GMR Allergy file.
  
   Problem 2:
   ----------
   The EGGS, SUBSTITUTES allergy dislike food preference will not map to 
   the EGG SUBSTITUTES food allergy in the GMR ALLERGIES file.
   
   Resolution 2:
   -------------
   Modify routine FHSELA2 to map the EGGS, SUBSTITUTES allergy dislike food
   preference to the EGG SUBSTITUTES food allergy in the GMR Allergy file.
  
 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 1. HD0000000376181 - FGH - Allergy not showing for pt food preferences
  
 Problem 1 and 2:
 ----------------
 In the routine FHSELA2 the hard coded list of food items are structured in
 this manner:
   ;;food item name;allergy name
   
 With additional food allergy names seperated by semi-colons each food item
 can be mapped to several GMR Allergies. 
  
 Any time routine, FHSELA2, is run, upon exiting, each hard coded food item
 is processed and the allergy mapping is checked. 
 If new allergies are added to an existing food item, the new allergies get
 mapped. If a new allergy is added to the GMR ALLERGIES file (#120.82)
 and it has an existing match in FHSELA2, it will be mapped to the matching
 allergy food preference dislike. If not, then routine FHSELA2 will be
 updated by a patch to map to new allergies.
  
 For the existing food items to be mapped to an existing GMR food 
 allergy, the allergy name must be an exact match to the allergy name in
 the B index of the GMR ALLERGIES file (file #120.82). This is the issue
 with barbeque sauce and the eggs substitute. In routine, FHSELA2, the
 allergy name is spelled BARBEQUE SAUCE, in the GMR ALLERGIES file it is
 spelled BARBECUE SAUCE. In the routine FHSELA2 the allergy name is spelled
 EGGS, 
 SUBSTITUTES and in the GMR ALLERGIES file it is spelled EGG SUBSTITUTES.
  
 These are the code changes required to fix these issues:
 BEFORE: FPS+21^FHSELA2
          ;;BARBEQUE SAUCE;BARBEQUE SAUCE
  
 AFTER: FPS+21^FHSELA2
          ;;BARBEQUE SAUCE;BARBEQUE SAUCE;BARBECUE SAUCE
  
 BEFORE: FPS+98^FHSELA2
          ;;EGGS, SUBSTITUTES;EGG, SUBSTITUTES
  
 AFTER: FPS+98^FHSELA2
          ;;EGGS, SUBSTITUTES;EGG, SUBSTITUTES;EGG SUBSTITUTES
  
 It is important to note that there are hard coded food items in FHSELA2 
 that do not have matches in the current version the GMR ALLERGIES file.
 These food items are:
 (In alphabetical order, formatted: item name;allergy name)
  ;;ALCOHOL, BEER;HOPS
  ;;CHILI;CHILI
  ;;GOOSEBERRIES;GOOSEBERRIES;GOOSE BERRIES;GOOSE BERRY;GOOSEBERRY
  ;;OLESTRA;OLESTRA;OLEAN
  ;;ORANGE;ORANGE;ORANGES;ORANGE JUICE;ORANGE OIL
  ;;PEAS, ENGLISH;ENGLISH PEAS
  ;;STRAWBERRIES;STRAWBERRIES;STRAWBERRIES PLUS
  
 These food items can be added to the FOOD PREFERENCES file as allergies,
 but can not be mapped to the GMR ALLERGIES file at this time. That may
 change with future updates to the GMR ALLERGIES file.
