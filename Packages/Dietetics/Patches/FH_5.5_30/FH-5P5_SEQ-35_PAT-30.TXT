Subject: ISSUES WITH NUTRITION STATUS AVERAGE REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1. When the user decides to sort the Nutrition Status Average Report by 
    the Clinician, the report is using the CLINICIAN (# 1) field rather
    than the CLINICIAN(S) (# 112) of the NUTRITION LOCATION (# 119.6) file.
  
 2. Routine FHASN71 will be updated to include Integration Agreements in 
    its comments section.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000511977
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The user can choose to sort the Nutrition Status Average Report by
    either the Ward the patients are admitted to or the Clinicians assigned
    to the ward the patients are admitted to. When sorting by the
    Clinician, the Nutrition Status Average Report sorts using the
    CLINICIAN (#1) field of the NUTRITION LOCATION (#119.6) file rather
    than the correct CLINICIAN(S) (#112) field. The sorted report will be
    incorrect.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Revise the Nutrition Status Average Report to use the CLINICIAN(S)
    (#112) field of the NUTRITION LOCATION (#119.6) file when the user
    chooses to sort by clinician.
  
 2. HD0000000536685
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Routine FHASN71 is a very old routine that makes a number of direct
    global reads of ^DGPM(D0,0) and ^DGPM("ATID1" index without integration
    agreements. Routine FHASN71 also makes use of the DGPMSTAT API without
    the integration agreement.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The following integration agreements were added to routine FHASN71:
    IA # 1071 - DGPMSTAT
                Supported usage
    IA # 2056 - Data Base Server API: Data Retriever Utilities
                Supported usage
  
    The following integration agreements were modified and added to routine
    FHASN71:
    IA # 1096 - PATIENT MOVEMENT file cross reference
                Controlled Subscription usage
                Dietetics added as a subscribing package 10/12/2012.  
    IA # 2090 - ACCESS TO PATIENT MOVEMENT DATA
                Controlled Subscription usage
                Global references added 10/12/2012
    ^DGPM(D0,0)
    .01 DATE/TIME                     0;1   Direct Global Read & w/FileMan
