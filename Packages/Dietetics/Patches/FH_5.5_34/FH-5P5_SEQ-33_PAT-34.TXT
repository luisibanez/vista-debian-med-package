 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000555526 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Printers used by Nutrition and Food Service package can be configured to
 print diet/tray ticket labels in one of the following four formats:
   1  3-1/2 x 15/16 (Single strip labels)
   2  4 x 1-7/16 (Single strip labels)
   3  2-5/8 x 1 (Laser labels - 30 labels per sheet)
   4  4 x 1-1/3 (Laser labels - 14 labels per sheet)
 When a patient has a food allergy on record a variable will be set to the
 value of *ALG. This should be printed on the diet/tray label to alert the
 dietetics staff the patient has an allergy and to review the meal being 
 prepared for the patient. This allergy indicator is not printing on either
 of the formats 3 and 4 for laser labels.
  
 Routine FHLABEL is used to format, build, print the laser labels. The food
 allergy indicator for a patient is set before the data is sent to routine
 FHLABEL to be formatted for output to the label printer. So it is defined.
 It is just not being included in the printout. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modification of routine FHLABEL to include the food allergy indicator 
 of *ALG on the label print out if it is defined.
