Subject: API FOR SNOMED CT EXCEPTIONS IN LAB

Category:

  - Other

Description:
============

  This patch is one of the patches in the Laboratory Electronic Data
  Interchange (LEDI) IV project. The other patches are: LR*5.2*350 and
  LA*5.2*74. Because this is a multi-package project, there is a
  multi-package host build that installs the following builds: HDI*1.0*7,
  LR*5.2*350, and LA*5.2*74.
  
  This patch distributes an Application Programming Interface (API) that
  the Lab package will use to report Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine -
  Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT or SCT) exceptions to the Standards and
  Terminology Services (STS) team for resolution. There are three
  exceptions/events that result in the Lab package using the API. They are:
  
     1) Error encountered while loading STS mapped SCT code into
        the target database
     2) Loading new/additional terms received from another system
        via Health Level 7 (HL7) messaging
     3) New terms are entered locally
  
  Use of this API by the Lab package is covered by Integration Control
  Registration (ICR) #5026.
  
  This patch installs a new mail group.  The mail group HDIS LAB
  EXCEPTIONS is used for routing of the exception data to the STS team.
  Users do not need to be added to this mail group since it is only
  referenced on the FORUM system.
  
  This patch installs a new server option.  The server option
  HDIS-LAB-EXCEPTION-SERVER [HDIS LAB EXCEPTION SERVER] is used to
  unbundle the exception data from the generated exception message.
  This unbundling of data is only done on the FORUM system.
  
  The post-init routine for this patch will delete Veterans Health
  Administration Unique Identifier(s) (VUIDs) from the XTID VUID FOR SET OF
  CODES file (#8985.1) for some Lab sets of codes that were not assigned
  consistently (possibly erroneously) and will never be messaged to the
  Health Data Repository (HDR).
  
  
  API Description
  ===============
  
  D LABXCPT^HDISVAP1(ARRAY,TASKIT)
  
  Input: ARRAY - Array containing information about the exception
               (FULL GLOBAL REFERENCE)
           @ARRAY@(ETC, n) = Transaction number ^ Time stamp
           @ARRAY@(ETC, n, [x, y, ...]) = Exception specific nodes
  
             ETC is a code denoting the type of exception to report
               1 = Load Exception
               2 = Reference Lab
               3 = Add/Edit by Site
  
             Time Stamp is in FileMan format
         TASKIT - Flag denoting if the work this API does should
                  be queued to run
                    1 = Queue to run
                    0 = Run now (DEFAULT)
  
 Output: None
       : The node @ARRAY@("XMZ") will be set equal to the message
         number of the generated message.  A value of zero (0) will
         be used when the message could not be generated.
       : The node @ARRAY@("ZTSK") will be set equal to the task number
         assigned if the TASKIT variable is set to one (1).  A value
         of zero (0) will be used if queuing of this API's work was
         not requested.
       : The node @ARRAY@("ERROR", ETC) will be set equal to NULL
         for input exception type codes that are not supported.
       : The node @ARRAY@("ERROR", ETC, n) will be set equal to NULL
         if the exception could not be handled.  This is typically
         set because of a missing input node.  This node will not be
         set for unsupported exception type codes.
  
  Notes: If this is not a production system the generated message
         will be sent to the currently defined user (i.e. DUZ)
       : The node @ARRAY@("ERROR") will be KILLed on input
       : A pipe (|) is used as the delimiter for the "SA" and "SB"
         nodes.  This is because they mirror the layout of the SNOMED
         CT extract already implemented by the Lab package.
       : A pipe (|) is used as the delimiter for the "RD" node.  This
         is because it mirrors the layout of the resolution data being
         transmitted by Enterprise Reference Terminology (ERT) to the Lab
         package for loading.
       : The following text lists the nodes for each exception type
  
    Exception Type Code 1: Load Exception
    =====================================
    @ARRAY@(1, n) = Transaction number ^ Time stamp
    @ARRAY@(1, n, "TXT") = Text to describe why the exception was
                           generated.  Contents is up to the
                           discretion of the Lab package.
    @ARRAY@(1, n, "SA") = The pipe delimited row of data for the
                          entry that would be generated by the LR
                          LAB SERVER when fulfilling a SNOMED extract
                          report
    @ARRAY@(1, n, "RD") = The pipe delimited row of data received
                          from STS that the Lab package attempted
                          to load
  
    Exception Type Code 2: Reference Lab
    ====================================
    @ARRAY@(2, n) = Transaction number ^ Time stamp
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "TXT") = Text to describe why the exception was
                           generated.  Contents is up to the
                           discretion of the Lab package.
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "SA") = The pipe delimited row of data for the
                          entry that would be generated by the LR
                          LAB SERVER when fulfilling a SNOMED extract
                          report
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "RL") = Location type code ^ Location number ^
                          Location name
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "EC") = Encoding characters from HL-7 message
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "OBX", 3) = Sequence 3 of received OBX segment
    @ARRAY@(2, n, "OBX", 5) = Sequence 5 of received OBX segment
  
      Location Type Code:
        1 = DoD              4 = IHS
        2 = VA               5 = Other
        3 = Non-government   6 = Unknown
  
    Exception Type Code 3: Add/Edit by Site
    =======================================
    @ARRAY@(3, n) = Transaction number ^ Time stamp
    @ARRAY@(3, n, "TXT") = Text to describe why the exception was
                           generated.  Contents is up to the
                           discretion of the Lab package.
    @ARRAY@(3, n, "SA") = The pipe delimited row of data for the
                          entry that would be generated by the LR
                          LAB SERVER when fulfilling a SNOMED extract
                          report
    @ARRAY@(3, n, "SB") = Same definition as the SA node except the
                          values prior to the add/edit are used.
                          Node not present for additions.
  
  
    Alternate Array Format
    ======================
    Array nodes that are delimited pieces of data can also be broken
    out into their individual pieces of data.  The only node that
    CAN NOT be broken out in this manner is the main node for the
    exception.
    
    Using exception type code 1 (Load Exception) as an example, the
    alternate array format would be:
  
      @ARRAY@(1, n) = Transaction number ^ Time stamp
      @ARRAY@(1, n, "TXT") = Some kind of text
      @ARRAY@(1, n, "SA", 1..N) = Piece N of the SA node
      @ARRAY@(1, n, "RD", 1..N) = Piece N of the RD node
  
    Note that the primary and alternate formats can not be used at
    the same time for the same node.  If this is done, the data will
    be ignored and the error node for the exception will be set.

  Software and Documentation Retrieval Information
  ================================================
  
  The LEDI IV patch will be controlled by a phased release. To control the
  implementation of the LEDI IV patch and related SNOMED CT files, a
  secured File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server with passwords will be used.
  A member of the Product Development team will contact your site with the
  FTP server, username, and password prior to your scheduled installation
  date.
  
  Although this is a controlled, phased released, the user and installation
  documentation will be available to all sites when the patch is officially
  released and the phased implementations start. This will give sites the
  opportunity to retrieve the documents before their phased installation
  date.
  
  
  Documentation is available for LEDI IV on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
  directory at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field
  Offices.
  
  The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
  This transmits files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also
  elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as
  follows:
         Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
         Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
         Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  NOTE: The files listed below will be listed in each of the LEDI IV
        patches that are part of the LEDI IV bundle; they only need to be
        downloaded once.
