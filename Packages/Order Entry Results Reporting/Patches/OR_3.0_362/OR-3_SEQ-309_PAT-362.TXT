Subject: SCHEDULE CHANGE ERROR FOR IMO ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an issue within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 (OERR) package. When renewing an inpatient medication for Inpatient 
 Medications for Outpatients (IMO) Clinic the system is not checking that
 the administration schedule name is valid.

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 HD0000000622440 - No schedule change warning for IMO orders
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When renewing an inpatient medication order in CPRS (Computerized Patient 
 Record System) GUI (Graphical User Interface) after the NAME (#.01) field 
 in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE FILE (#51.1) file has been changed, the 
 user should be presented with a warning message telling them that the 
 schedule for this order is not valid and the renewal process is cancelled.
 However, if the order was entered for an IMO Clinic location, this warning
 does not occur and the user is allowed to renew the order, despite the
 fact that the schedule name of the original order is no longer valid.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changed routine ORWNSS so that the system checks for the Clinic Orders 
 (IMO) display group during the renew action. If the NAME (#.01) field in 
 the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE FILE (#51.1) file does not match the schedule 
 name of the order being renewed, display the warning message to the user 
 and cancel the renewal process.
