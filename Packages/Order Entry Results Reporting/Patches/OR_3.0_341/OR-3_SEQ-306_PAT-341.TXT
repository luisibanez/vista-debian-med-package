Subject: PREVENTING ERRORS IN DISCHARGES/LAB RESULTS/ORDER ENTRY

Category:

Description:
============

 This patch will prevent the following errors from occurring.
 1) An undefined error when a patient in observation is discharged.
  
 2) When using the Manage orderable items [ORCM ORDERABLES MENU] for
    editing orderable items, orderable items are selectable for edit by
    internal entry number (IEN) even if they are not in the appropriate
    display group.
  
 3) A subscript error when an order number of 0 is sent back to the ORWDX1 
    ORDMATCH Remote procedure call.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. HD0000000306571 - UNDEF OREVENT2
     Problem:
     --------
     When Discharging a patient that is currently in observation and 
     answering YES to the "Will the patient be re-admitted immediately?"
     question will result in an <UNDEFINED> error, if the patient is not
     admitted within an hour.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORMEVNT2 has been modified so that the check for the existing
     movement is before the check of the action within the event. This will
     prevent an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
  
  2. HD0000000321291 - 6 New Display Group
     Problem:
     --------
     When using the Manage orderable items [ORCM ORDERABLES MENU] for 
     editing orderable items, orderable items are selectable for edit by 
     internalentry number (IEN) even if they are not in the appropriate 
     display group.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORCMEDT1 has been modified to screen out orderable items
     that are not related to the selected display group.
  
  
  3. HD0000000286219 - Error -- <SUBSCRIPT>ORDMATCH+10^ORWDX1
     Problem:
     --------
     In the case in which an order number is zero and is sent through 
     the ORWDX1 ORDMATCH remote procedure call a <SUBSCRIPT> error will
     occur.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modify routine ORWDX1 to correctly reset the ACTION variable for each
     order number sent into the RPC call. This will prevent the error if an
     order number of 0 is sent back.
