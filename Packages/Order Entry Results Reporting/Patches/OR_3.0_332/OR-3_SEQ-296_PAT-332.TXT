Subject: VBECS FOLLOW-UP FIXES PART DEUX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  This patch contains several modifications to CPRS relating to VBECS
  Blood Bank functionality.
  
  BLOOD BANK REPORT
  
  CQ 18708 - There are two places that display an error message
  when the VBECS VistALink port is down.
    a. Patient Info Screen on the VBECS order dialog - When this
       link error is displayed it is formatted and can use a
       user-defined error message.
       Parameter: OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE
    b. The Blood Bank report also displays an error message when
       the link is down. This message will also use the parameter
       OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE when VistALink is down.
  
  CQ 18634 - Blood Bank Reports displays warning:
  "ABO Rh: 1^Not able to open port".  This warning message comes
  back from VBECS when the VistALink is down. This has been fixed
  so that the error message that will be displayed comes from the
  parameter: OR VBECS ERROR MESSAGE.
  
  CQ 19330, 19467, 20038 Remedy Ticket 366911, 461972 -
  The AVAILABLE/ISSUED UNITS section of the Blood Bank
  report has been reformatted to make room for larger data fields and
  more columns.  A new column "Product ID" has been added to fix a
  problem with missing data when a patient had more than one
  Product with the same Unit ID. The OR VBECS AVAIL UNITS FORMAT
  Parameter was created to address issues found when printing the
  Blood Bank report in the horizontal format.
  
  This parameter determines the format that AVAILABLE/ISSUED UNITS are
  displayed on the Blood Bank Report and the Patient Information screen
  on the Blood Bank Order Dialog.
  
  OR VBECS AVAIL UNITS FORMAT values:
   0:HORIZONTAL Displays fields across the page, one line per date/time
                Printed reports line wraps if longer than 79 characters
   1:VERTICAL   Displays fields down the page in sections per date/time
                Printed report looks the same
   2:SPLIT HORIZONTAL -
                Patient Information Screen - Same as HORIZONTAL format
                Report - Line wraps if longer than 79 characters
                Printed Report - Line wraps if longer than 79 characters
  
  As more fields are added to the AVAILABLE/ISSUED UNITS section of
  the report, the length of the line may go beyond the 80
  character limit for printing. This is not an issue for
  the Windows display. The Patient Information Screen cannot be
  printed, so no attempt has been made to wrap the line when it
  goes beyond 79 characters. It functions the same when either
  HORIZONTAL or SPLIT HORIZONTAL is selected.
  
  For both HORIZONTAL display formats the length of the line
  expands or contracts depending on the column width of each field
  and the length of the longest line. Because of this it is
  possible, though not likely, that the line will not wrap even
  if SPLIT HORIZONTAL is selected.
  
  Each site can further customize the Blood Bank Report and Patient
  information display by shortening the length of each line by using
  the Location abbreviation instead of the Location Name. To do this,
  edit the parameter:
    OR VBECS LOC ABBREV BB REPORT
  This parameter is new with this patch and only affects the display
  of the report. The printed report will display the Location
  abbreviation due to space Limitations.
  
  CQ 19246 - Blood Bank report DAT comment is missing the last line.
  Previously, the comment for a Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) was
  missing the last line of the comment.
  
  Resolution: This has been fixed so the entire comment is visible. 
  
  CQ 18632 - The Blood Bank report has been changed to display the
  Division name instead of the number in the last column of the
  AVAILABLE/ISSUED UNITS section. This change was made to the display
  only. The printed version of the report will continue to print
  the Division number due to limited space on the line.
  
  BLOOD ORDER DIALOG
  
  CQ 19070 - With the VBECS 1.6.1.0 update, VBECS will be sending CPRS a
  'no blood required' flag for surgical procedures.  This patch adds the
  CPRS logic to recognize this value and will no longer require a
  specimen for those orders.
  
  Resolution: This patch adds the CPRS logic to recognize this value and
  will no longer require a specimen for those orders.
  
  NOTE: You won't see this functionality until both patch OR*3.0*332
  and VBECS 1.6.1.0 are installed.
  
  CQ 19259, 19139 Remedy Tickets 382825, 383708, 408643, 464652 -
  - Previously, CPRS saved the specimen unique identifier (UID) with the
  order and transmitted it to VBECS even if the Date/Time Wanted was past
  the specimen's expiration date or if the order was delayed, which could
  cause confusion. 
  
  Resolution: If the order's Date/Time Wanted is past the specimen's
  expiration date or if the order is a delayed order, CPRS will no
  longer save the specimen UID with the order nor transmit the specimen
  UID.
  
  CQ 19265 Remedy Ticket 366886 - 
  The Reason for Request had previously only been saved with component
  orders.
  
  Resolution: The Reason for Request will now be saved with
  all VBECS child orders, so it can be transmitted to VBECS;
  The Reason for Request displays on the "VBECS - Order
  Details" screen.
  
  CQ 18512 - The field requested the ability to alphabetically sort
  the items in  the Reason for Request field. 
  
  Resolution: Developers added the new parameter OR VBECS REASON SORT
  ALPHA to enable sites to alphabetically sort the list of reasons in
  the Reason for Request field on the Blood Component and Diagnostic
  Test Order Form dialog.
  
  CQ 20073 Remedy 457551 -
  The definition of the parameter OR VBECS REASON FOR REQUEST
  has been modified to include DIVISION level settings so that entries
  in this parameter can be setup by division
  
  CQ 19696 Remedy Tickets 429909, 471985, 424381 -
  The Component Request section of the Blood Bank
  Report was missing data. We found that component requests with
  the same date/time, were overwriting each other and ended up
  missing on the report.
  
  Resolution: Developers corrected the problem and all of the data
  should now display.
  
  CQ 19845 - The Item Ordered field of the lab child order was
  inadvertently being stuffed with the Orderable Item pointer; as these
  fields are defined to point to different files, when doing a
  FileMan Inquiry of the order appeared to be incorrect.
  Item Ordered was meant to be used by developers to troubleshoot
  problems, not to build the order. Item Ordered stored which item
  was selected off the Write Orders menu. For child orders, the
  Item Ordered field should be empty because the child orders came
  from the parent order, not from a selection on the Write Orders menu.
  
  Resolution: Developers added some code to ensure the Item Ordered
  field is empty for child orders, which is correct. 
  
  MISCELLANEOUS FIXES
  
  Unnecessary code removed from the routine [ORWLR] that displays the
  Lab Cumulative in CPRS Reports.  This change may improve the
  speed that the report displays.
  
  HL7 Review - New codes have been added to STATUS^ORMVBEC for
  compliance with HL7 standards; pre-existing codes will continue to
  be respected for backwards compatibility.
