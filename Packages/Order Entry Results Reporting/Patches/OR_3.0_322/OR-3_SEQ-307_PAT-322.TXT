Subject: MED QO CHECKER/TEAM LISTS/CANCELLED DELAYED ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 4 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 (OERR) package:
  
 1. Cancelling orders from a Delayed Orders list in CPRS (Computerized 
    Patient Record System) GUI (Graphical User Interface) causes them 
    to appear in the Active Orders list. They should be filtered out 
    until the release event happens.
  
 2. Patch OR*3*296 added the prompt 'Do you wish to continue?' to Vista
    option Medication Quick Order Report [OR MEDICATION QO CHECKER]. If 
    the user enters a lower case letter 'n' the report runs anyway.
  
 3. When using the remove function for VistA option Team List Mgmt Menu
    [ORLP TEAM MENU] '999  MORE.' is displayed as the entry value to use
    to advance the list of patients. However, entering '999' can
    inadvertently remove a patient from the list instead of advancing the 
    list. 
  
 4. When using the remove function for VistA option Team List Mgmt Menu
    [ORLP TEAM MENU] '999 MORE.' is displayed as the entry value to use 
    to advance the list of patients. However, the entry of '999' can 
    display a list of patients for removal selection instead of advancing
    the list.

 OVERVIEW:
 =========
  
 1. HD0000000329164 - Cancelled TD Orders Appear on Active Order List
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When event delayed orders are cancelled before the release event 
    happens, the cancelled order is listed on both the delayed orders view
    and the active order view on the CPRS Orders tab. These cancelled
    orders should not appear on the Active Orders list until the release
    event happens.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Cancelled Delayed Orders will not display on the Active Orders list 
    until the release event occurs.
  
  
 2. HD0000000353327 - OR MEDICATION QO CHECKER
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Patch OR*3*296 added the prompt 'Do you wish to continue?' to the 
    option Medication Quick Order Report [OR MEDICATION QO CHECKER]. If 
    the user enters a lower case n, the report continues to run anyway.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    An unintentional programming error kept the Medication Quick Order 
    Report from recognizing a lower case answer. The ATWILL^ORWOD tag 
    internally converts the response to uppercase but was not using the 
    converted text. Now the tag has been modified to use the appropriate 
    text.   
  
 3. HD0000000352987 - Team Lists
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the remove function for VistA option Team List Mgmt Menu
    [ORLP TEAM MENU] and the team contains more than 39 patients, 
    '999  MORE.' is displayed as the value to enter to advance the 
    list to view more patients. However, if the list contains only one 
    patient having an internal record number (IEN) in file #2 PATIENT 
    beginning with 999, the entry '999' inadvertently removes this
    patient from the team list instead of advancing the list. 
     
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When using the remove function the patient list has been modified
    to display '+ MORE.' as the value to enter to advance the list to
    view more patients. The entry of '999' no longer advances the list. 
  
  
  
  
 4. HD0000000069747 - TEAM LIST PROBLEM 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the remove function for VistA option Team List Mgmt Menu
    [ORLP TEAM MENU] and the team contains more than 39 patients, 
    '999  MORE.' is displayed as the value to enter to advance the 
    list to view more patients. However, if the list contains more than 
    one patient having an internal record number (IEN) in file #2 PATIENT
    beginning with 999, the entry of '999' displays these patients for 
    removal selection instead of advancing the list. 
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When using the remove function the patient list has been modified
    to display '+ MORE.' as the value to enter to advance the list to
    view more patients. The entry of '999' no longer advances the list.
