Description:
============

 ****************Attention*************************
 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA) v1.0 Enhancements 1 group of patches. There are a total of eight 
 patches and one .kid (host) file that must be installed as a group.  The 
 patches must be installed in the following order:
  
 OR*3*352
 PSS*1*164
 PSS*1*169
 PSO*7*390
 PSO*7*417
 PSJ*5*268
 <xxx>_1_0_P23.kid
 PSJ*5*260
 PSJ*5*288
 For the ".kid" file, value of <xxx> will be determined by the ward 
 automated dispensing equipment in use at your facility.  If no ward 
 automated dispensing equipment is in use at your site, this file will not 
 be needed. For those sites using Pyxis, xxx=PPU, for Omnicell sites, 
 xxx=OPU, and for McKesson sites, xxx=MPU.  To obtain this file or if 
 additional information is required regarding this ".kid" file, please 
 contact your site's Informatix contact.
  
  
 This is a companion patch to the Medication Order Check Healthcare 
 Application (MOCHA) version 1.0 Enhancements group of patches that will
 resolve a number of issues with the Computerized Patient Record System
 (CPRS) version 3.0 order checking functionality. The following issues are
 addressed:
    1.  When running the dosage order checks for a medication order, data
        is retrieved from the Pharmacy Enterprise Product System (PEPS)
        server. PEPS may return the "Unexpected error has occurred."
        message, which CPRS did not display to the user. CPRS will now
        inform the user that dosing order checks could not be performed
        when PEPS returns the "Unexpected error has occurred." message.
    2.  When a drug interaction order check results in two or more 
        interactions with the same severity between the same two drugs,
        CPRS displayed each interaction separately. CPRS will now group the
        multiple interactions with the same severity for the same drug pair
        together.
    3.  When an order for an outpatient medication is placed, CPRS would
        not perform order checks against the patient's existing medication
        clinic orders. CPRS will now include those medication clinic orders
        in its outpatient medication order checks.
    4.  A problem was identified where a user using the FileMan Inquire 
        to File Entries option would not see the monograph text for an
        ORDER CHECK INSTANCES file entry. The data dictionary for the ORDER
        CHECK INSTANCES file and the code that stores the monograph text
        were fixed so that the monograph text is now displayed when a user
        performs an inquiry.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The pre-installation routine will delete the existing data dictionary for
 the ORDER CHECK INSTANCES file (#100.05) without deleting existing data.
 This will allow KIDS to properly install the new data dictionary.
  
 The post-installation routine will create a tasked job that will clean up 
 the MONOGRAPH (#15) field in the ORDER CHECK INSTANCES file (#100.05) so 
 that FileMan will display the data in the MONOGRAPH field. The installer 
 will receive an email after this process is complete, providing 
 instructions on how to delete the post-installation routine.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is

     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
