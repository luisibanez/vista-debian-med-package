Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 2 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. Display Patient Alerts and Alert Recipients [ORB3 ALERT RECIPIENTS]
 option has a non-standard default of 'Close' even if there are multiple
 screens.
  
 2. The CPRS Orders Tab detailed display overwrites the previous chart
 review information with the latest chart review data.
  
  
 Associated Remedy:
 ==================
 1. HD0000000069366    Non-std default action (Close) in Notif Mgt option
  
 2. HD0000000268742    Orders Tab confusion

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000069366    Non-std default action (Close) in Notif Mgt option
    
    Problem:
    ========
    In the Display Patient Alerts and Alert Recipients [ORB3 ALERT
    RECIPIENTS] option, the default action is 'Close'. This is non-standard
    and frequently causes users to close the window even though they really
    wanted to continue processing.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    The OR PATIENT ALERTS protocol has been modified to remove the default 
    of 'Close'. This causes the ListMan interface to use the standard
    default of 'Next Screen', if there is additional data to process. In
    the event there is no additional data, the standard default of 'Quit'
    is used.
  
 2. HD0000000268742    Orders Tab confusion
  
    Problem:
    ========
    The Orders tab detailed display shows the order along with the most
    recent Chart Review date and time. However, when there is a change to
    the original order, and that change has a chart review performed, the
    detail information is incorrect.
    If an earlier chart review was performed and recorded and a new chart
    review is performed, the earlier chart review is marked as reviewed
    using the newest chart review data (overwriting existing data).
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Routine ORCACT1 was modified to correctly file the Chart Review 
    information each time a chart review is performed. 
    Now, when an earlier chart review was performed and recorded and a 
    new chart review is also performed, the earlier existing chart review
    data is NOT modified (protecting existing data).
