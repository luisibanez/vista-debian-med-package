Description:
============

 This patch is part of the Identification of Principal Mental Health
 Provider (IPMHP) project within the Improve Veteran Mental Health (IVMH)
 initiative.  It is to be released in conjunction with PCMM
 patch SD*5.3*575, with SD*5.3*575 being installed first.  The purpose of

 CPRS GUI, one being the Patient Inquiry display and the other being the
 Primary Care button detailed display.

 PROBLEM OVERVIEW:
 =================
  
 Problem #1:
 -----------
 The Identification of Principal Mental Health Provider (IPMHP) project
 requires the Mental Health Treatment Coordinator (MHTC) to be displayed
 within CPRS GUI as part of the Patient Inquiry display.  The MHTC will
 be displayed in two locations which currently display the Primary Care
 Provider/Team information.  The first location is outside CPRS control
 as it is returned via a Registration package API, which in turn uses
 a PCMM API to gather the information.  This modification will be part of
 the SD*5.3*575 patch mentioned earlier.  The output will display as
 follows (formatted to fit screen):
  
  Primary Care Team: TEAM 1                      Phone: ###-###-####
        PC Provider: PROVIDER,PRIMARY         Position: TEAM LEAD
                          Pager:                 Phone: 
  
  MH Treatment Team: TEAM MH
 MH Treatment Coord: PROVIDER,M H             Position: PSYCHOLOGIST (MHTC)
                   Analog Pager:                 Phone: ###-###-####
                  Digital Pager: 
  
 The other location within the Patient Inquiry display is under CPRS
 control and will be modified to display the MHTC and the MHTC's position
 just after the Primary Practitioner and Primary Care Team as part of the
 Primary Care Information section of the Patient Inquiry display.  The
 MHTC information will include the MHTC providers name and the PCMM
 position which they were assigned.  If an MHTC was not assigned to the
 patient, no information will be displayed concerning the MHTC.  Below is
 how the Primary Care Information section currently displays:
  
  Primary Care Information:
  Primary Practitioner:     PROVIDER,PRIMARY
  Primary Care Team:        TEAM 1
  
  
 Resolution #1:
 --------------
 Routine ORCXPND1 was modified to use the PCMM API to display the MHTC
 below the Primary Care Information section on the Patient Inquiry display.
 If an MHTC is assigned to the patient, the MHTC's name and position will
 be displayed as well as the team (as seen below).  If an MHTC is not
 assigned to the patient, then the MHTC information will not be displayed
 and the Primary Care Information section will display by itself.  The new
 output is displayed below (formatted to fit in this description):
  
  Primary Care Information:
  Primary Practitioner: PROVIDER,PRIMARY
  Primary Care Team:    TEAM 1
  
  MH Treatment Information:
  MH Treatment Coord:   PROVIDER,M H          Position: PSYCHOLOGIST (MHTC)
  MH Treatment Team:    TEAM MH
  
  
 Problem #2:
 -----------
 The Identification of Principal Mental Health Provider (IPMHP) project
 requires the Mental Health Treatment Coordinator (MHTC) to be displayed
 within CPRS GUI as part of the Primary Care detailed display.  This is
 accessed by depressing the Primary Care button in the header of CPRS GUI
 which launches the detailed display.  This display currently shows the
 primary care team information and needs to have the MHTC information
 included in it as well.
  
  
 Resolution #2:
 --------------
 Routine ORWPT1 was modified to use the PCMM API to display the MHTC
 information on the Primary Care detailed display.  It will be formatted
 to match the other care providers listed on this display and will
 include the Mental Health (MH) Treatment Team and the MHTC information
 (name, analog pager number, digital pager number, and office phone
 number).  Below is how the formatting of this information will appear:
  
                 MH Treatment Team:
          MH Treatment Coordinator:
                      Analog Pager:
                     Digital Pager:
                      Office Phone:
