Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID,
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These five
 host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 functionality. The 
 host files were created to simplify installation at Veterans Health
 Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the phased implementation
 release method for CPRS v28. CPRS v28 will follow a phased implementation.
 To see current status and target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to
