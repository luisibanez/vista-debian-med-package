Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 ****************************** Note **************************************
 This patch is a follow-up patch for Medication Order Check Healthcare 
 Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  The MOCHA v1.0 patches are being released as a 
 phased implementation release.  To see current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites should have received instructions and guidance on the installation 
 of MOCHA v1.0 as it is a phased implementation. Patches PSO*7*387,
 PSJ*5*263, PSS*1*163 and OR*3*346 need to be installed within 2 business 
 days at all sites that have MOCHA v1.0 installed in production.  The 
 remaining sites need to install the patches included with this release 
 immediately after the installation of the MOCHA v1.0 patches.  These 
 patches may be installed in any order after the MOCHA v1.0 patches are 
 installed.   (The MOCHA v1.0 installation included patches PSS*1*136, 
 PSO*7*251, PSJ*5*181, OR*3*272, PSS*1*117, PSO*7*375)
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 Specific issues handled
 with this patch include the following:
  
 - Vendor DB Down
    It was reported that upon signature of the order, the Order Check 
 Detail no longer displayed that Order Checks could not be performed for 
 Drug Interactions when the First Data Bank (FDB) database was down.  This 
 issue has been fixed in this patch.
  
 - Double Drug-Drug Interaction
    For certain drug-drug interaction such as Warfarin/Amiodarone, at the 
 time of signature the user would receive two identical order checks.  
 This has been fixed in this patch.
  
 - Timeout when signing large numbers of med orders
    A scenario where the user would enter large number of med orders 
 (either through a large order set or many individual orders) and choose 
 to sign all of those orders at once was causing CPRS to hang and 
 eventually timeout.  This would result in a locked patient chart and the 
 user could not finish signing the orders.  It was determined that 
 repetitive and unnecessary calls to the FDB server were taking place for 
 each med order being signed.  This patch modifies the implementation of 
 how CPRS processes the Pharmacy Enhanced Order Checks to remove the 
 redundant calls and thus improving Order Check performance which in 
 turn eliminates the Timeout scenario. This issue is logged as Remedy 
 Ticket HD0000000502389.
