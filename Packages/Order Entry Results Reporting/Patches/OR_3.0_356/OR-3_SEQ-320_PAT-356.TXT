Subject: ALERTS AND QUICK ORDER DISPLAY

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
 1) When ordering certain types of quick orders, information about the order    
    such as service connected and treatment factors display even though there
    has been no opportunity to enter this information about the order.
 
 2) When orderable items are flagged to display an alert to the provider
    because they are expiring, the alerts are not working correctly for the
    outpatient parameter.
 
 3) In certain scenarios, when entries to the Orders file (#100) are  
    deleted, there are dangling cross references that are left behind. 
    These cause errors during nightly processing and CPRS order views.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. HD0000000099418 - Strange Display in Quick Order (Nursing)
     Problem:
     --------
     When ordering certain types of quick orders, information about the order    
     such as service connected and treatment factors display even though there
     has been no opportunity to enter this information about the order.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORWDXM2 has been modified to prevent the display of the 
     service connected and treatment factors of newly created orders.
  
  
  2. HD0000000316377 - Flag Inpatient EXPIRING orders for PROVIDER 
                       RECIPIENTS. Parameter set for Ordering Provider 
                       to receive alert is not functional.  
     Problem:
     --------
     When orderable items are flagged to display an alert to the provider
     because they are expiring, the alerts are not working correctly for the
     outpatient parameter.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORB3TIM2 has been modified to include a check for the ORB 
     OI EXPIRING - OUTPT PR parameter in order to fire the correct 
     alerts if flagged.
  
  
  3. HD0000000382627 - 6 WNY - Check Lab Orders options leaving dangling 
                       xrefs
     Problem:
     --------
     In certain scenarios, when entries to the Orders file (#100) are 
     deleted, there are dangling cross references that are left behind. 
     These cause errors during nightly processing and CPRS order views.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Because it is not exactly clear which process is leaving these multiple    
     cross references behind, routines ORB3TIM2 and ORQ12 have been modified   
     to delete dangling pointers if they are encountered and there is no  
     corresponding Orders file (#100) entry
