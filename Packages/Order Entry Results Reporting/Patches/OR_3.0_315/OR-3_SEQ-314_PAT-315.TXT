Associated patches: (v)OR*3*243    <<= must be installed BEFORE `OR*3*315'

Subject: MISCELLANEOUS LAB CHANGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()

Description:
============

 1. In the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), on the Labs tab,
 under Anatomic Pathology, the accession number display should be changed
 to show the Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) accession number. This patch
 makes this change by looking for the presence of the Application
 Programming Interface (API) GETACC^LRJWLST. If that API exists, CPRS will
 use it to retrieve the COTS accession number from the LAB DATA file 
 (#63). If no COTS accession number is available, the legacy accession 
 number will display.
  
 2. In CPRS, on the Labs tab, under Microbiology, the accession number
 display should be changed to show the COTS accession number. This patch
 makes this change by looking for the presence of the API GETACC^LRJWLST
 and, if present, uses the API to retrieve the COTS accession number from
 the LAB DATA file (#63). If no COTS accession number is available, the 
 legacy accession number will display.
  
 ***Important Notes*** When this patch is installed on a system that does 
 not yet contain the patch LR*5.2*383, running XINDEX will generate an 
 error about a 'Reference to routine '^LRJWLST'. However, the reference is 
 conditional, so will not cause a failure on the system.
  
 3. Laboratory V5.2 patch LR*5.2*393 is adding the ability to inactivate a
 collection sample. CPRS is being modified to honor the INACTIVE DATE
 (#64.9101) field in the COLLECTION SAMPLE (#62) file once they are 
 available.
  
 4. An error was occurring in CPRS when attempting to display the Anatomic 
 Pathology supplemental report. The error, an undefined variable error 
 that appeared in the VistA error trap in a FileMan routine, was caused by
 a modification done in support of the LEDI v4 release. In order to
 eliminate the error, a modification was done to CPRS to support the LEDI
 v4 change.
  
 5. There are two new order reasons that are needed by Laboratory V5.2.
 They are Obsolete Order and Purged Order. A request was made that these
 two reasons be added to the ORDER REASON file (#100.03). The post install
 of this patch will automatically add these reasons.
  
 6. The Lab and Pharmacy users have requested that when certain fields are
 updated in the LABORATORY TEST (#60) file, there should be a CPRS call
 made to search for quick orders that contain the test that was updated. If
 any are found, the appropriate personnel will be notified. This patch
 addresses this issue by creating a new routine ORUQO that will search for
 the specified test and notify the members of the OR CACS mail group. They
 will be told the quick order name and whether it is active or inactive.
  
 7. Since the COTS system, when present, will now be considered the Lab
 system of record, the date/time completed from the COTS system should be
 what is stored in the Lab system as the date/time completed. However, this
 might cause some concern on the CPRS side since there may be a delay if
 the interface from VistA to the COTS system is down for any reason. In
 order to help mitigate this issue, this patch will modify the information
 stored in the RESULTS DATE/TIME field (#71) of the ORDER file (#100) to
 contain the date/time the results information was sent to CPRS, rather
 than the date/time completed from the COTS system.
  
 8. Laboratory V5.2 patch LR*5.2*393 will add the ability to inactivate a
 topography. CPRS will honor the INACTIVE DATE (#64.9103) field in the
 TOPOGRAPHY FIELD (#61) file when they become available.
  
 9. The Laboratory Lab System Re-engineering project (LSRP) has requested
 an API to allow Lab to veil an order in CPRS. This patch adds that new
 API.
  
 10. LSRP has requested an API to update the PACKAGE REFERENCE field (#33) 
 of the ORDER file (#100). This patch adds that new API.
