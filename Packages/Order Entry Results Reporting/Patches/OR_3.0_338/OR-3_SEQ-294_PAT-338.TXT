Subject: UPDATE COVERSHEET PARAMETER

Category: 
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an index out of bounds error that occurs in 
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) when the number of coversheet
 report sequences exceed eight reports, and/or when the sequences are 
 numbered outside the number range 1-8, in the parameter ORWCV1 
 COVERSHEET LIST.
  
       
 Associated Remedy Tickets:
 ==========================
 HD0000000416157  Coversheet can only handle 8 boxes when more are 
 available to set.

 Remedy Overview
 =====================
 Problem:
 --------
 When more than eight coversheet report sequences are added to the 
 parameter ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST users are confronted with a 'list index 
 out of bounds' error after selecting a patient in CPRS GUI. The CPRS GUI 
 coversheet is only coded to display a total of eight coversheet reports, 
 however the parameter (ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST) is defined to accept up to 
 999 reports.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------     
 The ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST parameter in the PARAMETER DEFINITON file 
 (#8989.51) INSTANCE DOMAIN field (6.2) is being modified from the value 
 1:999:2 to 1:8:2. This new value will prevent more than eight coversheet 
 report sequences from being added and also limit the valid sequence 
 numbers to one through eight. The ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST can be 
 set for the following levels: User, Division, System, and Package.
  
 When the Packman function INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE is selected the 
 Environment Check routine ORZZFACE will run. If any cover sheet 
 parameter settings contain more than eight sequences, or if any of the
 existing sequences are numbered greater than eight, the message
 "Installation of OR*3*338 Aborted. Please see mail message for details."
 will display. A Mailman message will be sent to the user attempting to
 install the patch with the subject line 'PARAMETER VALIDATION'.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Below is a list of entities which have an instance in parameter
 ORWCV1 COVERSHEET LIST that does not fall within the valid range of 1-8.
 These need to be corrected before install of OR*3*338.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch can be installed with users on the system. Installation will 
 take less than two minutes. 
       
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
              
 2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu 
     [XPD MAIN] and select Installation.
  
 3.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following 
     options (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*338): 
         
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the

    answer NO. 
       
 6. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
    Protocols? NO//', answer NO. 
  
 Note: The Environment Check routine ORZZFACE runs two times 1) when the 
 PackMan message containing this patch invokes the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE
 PackMan option to load the transport global, and 2) when installing the 
 patch. The ORZZFACE routine is automatically deleted with the successful
 installation of this patch.
