 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000325357 - Editing order sets with ORCM MENU and ORCM ORDER SETS
                      causes the system to hang.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was discovered that sites with complex order menus could experience
    a significant pause when selecting items to replace or modify. This was
    caused by the software looping through all associated menus repeatedly
    to insure the modified item was not an ancestor to itself. This can
    occur in the following options:
  
       Search/replace components [ORCM SEARCH/REPLACE]
       Enter/edit order menus [ORCM MENU]
  
 ***NOTE***
  
 Remedy HD0000000325357 reports performance lags for both Enter/edit 
 order menus [ORCM MENU] and Enter/edit order sets [ORCM ORDER SETS].
  
 These are two separate issues and will require separate solutions.
  
 Remedy HD0000000325357 tracks the fix to ORCM MENU with patch OR*3*314.
 The performance lag for ORCM ORDER SETS is *not* fixed with OR*3*314.
 Remedy HD0000000606919 has been created to track the performance issue
 with ORCM ORDER SETS, which has no fix at this time.
       
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCMEDT5 was modified to prevent the software from rechecking
    menus that have already been checked.
  
  
 2. HD0000000327935 - Potential Dialog selection issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    It was discovered that a potential dialog selection problem could occur
    while using the Search/replace components [ORCM SEARCH/REPLACE] option.
    If a large number of components were selected by the user to be replaced
    some of the components may not be updated.  This was caused by the
    routine ORCMEDT5 not properly handling the selected values returned
    by a FileMan Application Program Interface (API).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine ORCMEDT5 was modified to properly handle the selected values
    even when a large number of components have been selected.
