Subject: CORRECT TWD AFTER MISSED APPOINTMENT ANTICOAGULATOR GUI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch includes a new AMT GUI executable and corrects the following 
 issues:
  
 1) Anticoagulation Management Tool (AMT) GUI is designed to be invoked
    from the Tools Menu in CPRS. The executable file (AntiCoagulate.exe) is
    either placed on a workstation or in a network share directory. When
    running from a network directory location the AMT Help file fails to
    load. 
    
 2) Users can flag a missed appointment in AMT so that the program can
    calculate the 'Show Rate' given on the Demographics tab. This entry 
    is also used in anticoagulation reports and utilities. In some cases 
    after a missed appointment has been flagged the daily dosing and weekly
    total dose erroneously revert to previous dosing amounts.
  
 3) The VistA report Calculate TTR (Rosendaal Method) [ORAM ROSENDAAL 
    TTR REPORT] is not considering missed appointment and inactive patient 
    data properly in the calculation, which produces inaccurate TTR (time 
    in therapeutic range) results.
  
 4) When a progress note is entered in AMT it can be saved and signed
    without requiring the user to enter the required information.
  
 5) The AMT Utility tab provides the function "Pts lost to follow up" 
    to search for patients in the anticoagulation program who have not been
    seen recently. This function is not presenting the missed appointments
    accurately.
  
 6) If the daily tablet amount for Monday is entered as 0.25 the error
    " '1/4' is not a valid floating point value" displays and the dosing
    letter has a blank in the # of tablets box for Monday.
  
 7) When INR results of "> 3.5" are sent to Anticoagulation Management 
    GUI, they are being display as 3.5.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000514093 - Anticoagulation Clinical Tool Parameter Setup in
                      Vista
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the AMT GUI is executed from a network directory location the Help
 file fails to load upon selecting Contents from the AMT Help menu pull
 down.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The AMT GUI has been updated to always check the directory location that
 the executable is running from (local or remote network) for the existence
 of the Help file.
  
 **NOTE** Microsoft Windows 7 internal security does not allow files with 
    the .hlp extension to be accessed from a remote network location. This 
    is a known issue with Windows 7 and the resolution is not in the scope
    of this patch.   
  
   
 2. HD0000000523093 - Incorrect TWD display following missed apt
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2110
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After a user records a missed appointment there is a possibility for the
 daily dosing schedule and total weekly dosage to erroneously revert
 to a previous dates dosing schedule. This was caused by the incorrect date
 of the last INR being recorded as the date the missed appointment was
 entered in the tool.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The AMT GUI will now record the date of the last recorded INR result when
 a missed appointment is listed on the activity table of the Flowsheet tab.
      
 **NOTE** It should be known that when a missed appointment is entered,
 there is no automatic date entry for when the missed appointment occurred.
 The date on the Anticoagulation Activity tab will display in chronological
 order as it relates to the last INR date.
  
      
 3. HD0000000593233 - Rosendaal calculation incorrect
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The clinic and facility-wide calculation of the TTR using the Rosendaal
 method includes inactive patients and missed appointments. This is causing
 the report to produce inaccurate results.
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Because the Rosendaal method does not take inactive patients and missed
 appointment entries into account, routine ORAMTTR has been modified to
 include two options when a user selects Calculate TTR (Rosendaal Method) 
 facility-wide report: 
  
             I    Include inactive patients and missed appointments
             E    Exclude inactive patients and missed appointments
  
 Selecting the include report will produce the same report as before 
 installing this patch; and selecting the exclude report will omit 
 patients that are considered inactive as well as missed appointment 
 entries. Patients are determined to be inactive if they are marked
 inactive in the ORAM FLOWSHEET file (#103) or they have a span of more
 than 56 days without an INR result recorded in the selected date range.
      
 4. HD0000000599707 - Walla Walla (R1 site) problem with signed, no text 
                      Notes
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2191
  
 Problem:
 --------  
 It is possible to create and sign Anticoagulation discharge notes
 that contain no text while in the AMT GUI. This GUI was not checking for
 the necessary note information when the user completes the AMT visit.
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The AMT GUI has been modified to require the user to select and 
 complete at least one input check box and its associated text (if 
 any) in the discharge note dialog box before allowing the user to sign
 the note. 
  
 When the patch is installed, the post-install routine ORY354 will 
 automatically run and search all TIU notes for patients with entries 
 in the ORAM FLOWSHEET file (#103) for any that were signed with no 
 text entry. This routine may take some time to run, based on the number of
 records in File #103 ORAM FLOWSHEET. The search results will be listed in
 a Mailman message with the subject line "ANTICOAG PATIENTS WITH BLANK
 NOTES". This message will be received by the person installing the patch
 and should be provided to the appropriate person at each site responsible
 for anticoagulation tracking and management. A sample message is displayed
 below:

 5. HD0000000602516 - Patients lost to follow up incorrect
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2197
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The utility option "Pts lost to follow up" is used to locate and display
 patients in the anticoagulation program who have not been seen recently. 
 However, the entry of a missed appointment is being considered the same as
 a patient visit by the utility. This may result in providers incorrectly
 surmising that a patient has been seen recently, when they have actually
 missed an appointment.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORAM2 has been modified to change the lost to follow up utility
 so that it will now display both the last missed appointment within the
 selected date range if one exists, and the existing last seen date, which
 is the first date outside the date range that contains an INR. It should
 be noted that the missed appointment date that displays may not be the
 date the missed appointment was recorded and may not be the actual date of
 the missed appointment.
      
 6. HD0000000719861 - When entering letter with o.25 dosing, letter shows
 blank and is giving error
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When entering the numeric value of one-fourth tablet as 0.25 in the 
 AMT dosing schedule for a Monday, the error " '1/4' in not a valid 
 floating point value" displays to the user when printing or reviewing the
 letter. On the letter, Monday's tablet size is blank. When going back to
 look at the dosing schedule in AMT, Monday's tablet dosing displays the
 "1/4" character instead of the correct decimal 0.25 value.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The AMT GUI has been modified to correctly accept the value of 0.25 and
 use the "1/4" character only for the printed letter and not for the actual
 dosing schedule in AMT.
  
 7. HD0000000769824 - INR result >3.5 on point of care device - fingerstick
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2335
    
 Problem:
 --------
 INR results that are received from the Lab package with a "<" or ">" 
 symbol are displayed in the AMT GUI without the symbol. This is
 particularly a problem with Point of Care devices, as some report INR 
 results over 3.5 as ">3.5". The AMT software strips off the symbol
 when displaying a result containing these symbols.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update the AMT software to display the "<" or ">" before the numeric value
 of the INR result in the AMT GUI. All INR results that were received from
 the Lab package containing either symbol before installing this patch 
 will display the appropriate symbol after installing OR*3*354.
  
 INR results that were stored in File #103 ORAM FLOWSHEET without the 
 accompanying symbol before patch OR*3*354 was installed will display on 
 the AMT graph as ">#/#" (">3.5/3.5").
