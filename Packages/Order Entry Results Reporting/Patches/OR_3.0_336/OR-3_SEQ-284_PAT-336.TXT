 This patch is a replacement patch for OR*3*290, which has been entered in 
 error.  If you installed OR*3*290 successfully, do not uninstall it. 
 Whether you have installed OR*3*290 successfully or not, you will need to 
 install OR*3*336.  There is no replacement patch for PSO*7*328 or the 
 VEXRX routines.
  
 This patch addresses a site reported problem where a narcotic order
 replaced an audiology consult order in the ORDERS file (#100).

 Overview:
 =========
   
     Problem:
     --------
     
     An unexpected narcotic order was found in Order Entry/Results 
     Reporting (OERR) for a patient. Upon examination of the affected 
     order in file #100 (ORDERS) it was discovered that one patient's
     Audiology consult order had been overwritten by a different patient's
     Outpatient controlled drug order. The Outpatient order was a
     prescription renewal order generated by the AudioCARE AudioRENEWAL
     function. The class III code which performs the renewal process was
     not getting the assigned order number for the renewal the same way
     that Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) does, causing the
     overwrite. This problem is tracked by Patient Safety PSPO #1218. 
  
     The AudioCARE AudioRENEWAL Module was de-activated by all 43 locations
     on Jan.16, 2009 to prevent the problem from occurring.
  
   
     Resolution:
     -----------     
     A new Class I interface has been written so the AudioCARE 
     AudioRENEWAL process can obtain the assigned order number the same way
     that Computerized Patient Records System (CPRS) does. Patch OR*3*336
     installs the new interface. In order to implement the new interface,
     modifications to the renewal code in the Class III routine VEXRX were
     necessary. The refill code of the VEXRX routine was not affected. The
     AudioRENEWAL process will now use a standard CPRS Application
     Programming Interface (API) to perform the renewal.
    
     This new Class I interface has been written in such a way that other
     renewal systems will be able to utilize the same API to renew
     Outpatient prescriptions. However, other renewal systems have not
     been tested using this software.
   
     OR*3*336 introduces the new mail group, AUTORENEWAL. Messages to
     this group will contain information about prescription renewals that
     could not be automatically processed. For example: a lock on the order
     failed, or the CPRS order number is missing from the PRESCRIPTION file
     (#52).
    
     A new parameter has been added: OR AUTORENEWAL USER. The auto renewal 
     process uses a proxy user to be the 'entered by' person in the ORDERS
     (#100) file. This parameter defines that user. Sites previously 
     using the renewal function may already have USER,AUDIOCARE PHONE 
     set up for renewals. If not, set up a proxy user such as 
     "RENEWAL,AUTO" in the NEW PERSON (#200) file to place in the new
     parameter.
    
     A new notification is being released with this patch: OP RX RENEWAL  
     REQUEST. This notification is exported with package parameter
     values set as follows: 
      
       . ORB ARCHIVE PERIOD - 30
       . ORB DELETE MECHANISM - All Recipients
       . ORB FORWARD BACKUP REVIEWER - No
       . ORB FORWARD SUPERVISOR - No
       . ORB FORWARD SURROGATES - No
       . ORB PROCESSING FLAG - Disabled
       . ORB PROVIDER RECIPIENTS - Ordering Provider, Attending, Primary 
                                   and Teams (OAPT)
       . ORB URGENCY - High
   
     ***Important Note***
     Notifications are processed by IEN (internal entry number) from the 
     OE/RR NOTIFICATIONS file (100.9). Any site-defined notifications run
     the risk of being over-written by new notifications that are 
     nationally released. If you have locally defined notifications, you
     may need to renumber them before this patch will install.
     Specifically, IEN #73 is being added.
   
 Documentation Retrieval:
 ========================
 An updated CPRS Technical Manual, CPRS GUI Technical Manual, and a 
 combined Release Notes/Installation Guide will be distributed with
 OR*3*336. The documents are available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices.
   
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
 (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from 
 the first available FTP server.
   
 (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly 
 from a specific server as follows:
   
 Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
 Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
 Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
 The documentation distribution includes:
   
    FILE NAMES             DESCRIPTION                     FORMAT

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 All sites are expected to install OR*3*336 to their production Vista 
 system, even if they are not currently using AudioCARE applications. 
 This installation does not change the functionality of CPRS or Outpatient
 Pharmacy applications.
   
 For the renewal process to be fully functional using the new Class I 
 interface sites licensed to run the AudioRENEWAL Module must install
 the following patches:
   
 PSO*7*328      OUTPATIENT PHARMACY
 OR*3*336       ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING
   
 PSO*7*328 is an information only patch that explains how to download
 the updated routine VEXRX (Class III refill). The updated VEXRX should be
 installed prior to installing OR*3*336 at all sites using AudioCARE 
 applications, even if they are not using the AUDIORENEWAL module. 
  
 Note: If you have already installed the updated VEXRX routine from 
 PSO*7*328, then you do not need to install it again. The VEXRX
 routine has not changed since the release of PSO*7*328.
  
 ENVIRONMENT CHECK: OR*3*336 contains an environment check that looks 
 for the renewal version of VEXRX that was being used when the problem
 was reported in January 2009. If the January 2009 renewal version of 
 VEXRX is found, the installation of OR*3*336 aborts. If this occurs 
 retrieve and install the correct VEXRX routine, then use the 'Restart
 Install of Package(s)' option to complete the OR*3*336 patch 
 installation. For sites not using AudioCARE refill or renewal, the
 pre-environment checks will be skipped if the Class III VEXRX routine is
 not in the system.
  
 ***Before installing patch OR*3*336, consult with the Pharmacy staff to 
 determine the appropriate person to coordinate the membership for the 
 AUTORENEWAL mail group used in the renewal process. Messages to 
 this group will contain information on renewals not sent to providers 
 and processed record count totals.*** 
  
 Below is a step-by-step procedure for installing OR*3*336.
   
 This patch can be installed with users in the system. However, no 
 AudioCARE processing should take place during the installation. 
 Processing during installation may result in a system  error. 
 Installation  will take less than five minutes.
  
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
   
    1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
        INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
           NOTE: If patch OR*3*290 was not installed routines ORAREN and
           ORY290 will not exist before installing OR*3*336. If you have
           installed patch OR*3*290, which has now been marked entered
           in error, the "before" checksums for ORAREN and ORY290 will
           match the "before" checksum in the Routine Information section
           of this patch, OR*3*336.  Both routines have been modified by
           this patch and the "after" checksum should match what is
           provided in this patch description. Do not uninstall patch
           OR*3*290. 
  
    2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
        [XPD MAIN] and select Installation. 
   
    3.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following
        options (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*336):
       
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
           not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
           will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
           this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
           patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
           in the transport global.
      
    4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
        OR*3.0*336

 IMPORTANT NOTE: If this site is NOT using the AudioRENEWAL Module, 
 your installation is complete.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ===============================
 This section is only for sites licensed to use the AudioRENEWAL Module. 
 The purpose of this section is to provide information for consideration 
 after routine VEXRX and patch OR*3*336 are installed. IRM, Pharmacy, and 
 Providers should work together to completed this section and monitor
 renewal activity.
  
 Refer to the Release Notes/Installation Guide for additional information 
 about the steps below. 
  
   1. Assign members to the AUTORENEWAL mail group using the option Mail
      Group Edit [XMEDITMG].
  
   2. If necessary, set up the proxy user in the NEW PERSON (#200) file for
      filing renewal requests. Sites may already have USER,AUDIOCARE PHONE
      set up for renewals. This is the user that will be the 'entered by'
      person in CPRS for the automatic renewal orders. No menu options, 
      person classes, or keys need to be added to this user.
  
   3. Edit the parameter OR AUTORENEWAL USER and enter the proxy user
      defined in step 2.
  
   4. Review the settings for the notification OP RX RENEWAL REQUEST very
      closely and determine the settings which are most appropriate for
      your usage of AudioRENEWAL. If your site elects to use this
      new notification, level changes can be made for system, division,
      location, service, team(OE/RR), or user entities. Do not edit the
      exported package level parameter settings.
  
   5. If using the new notification OP RX RENEWAL REQUEST, enable the
      notification using the option Enable/Disable Notifications [ORB3
      PROCESSING FLAG] at the appropriate hierarchy level for your 
      usage.
  
   6. Update AudioRENEWAL Clinic List on the AudioCARE server.
  
   7. Reactivate the AudioRENEWAL Module on the AudioCARE server.
  
   8. Notify Pharmacy, Providers, and Nurses that AudioRENEWAL has been 
      reactivated and who to contact for problems.
  
 After running the option to process refills/renewals:
  
   9. Confirm that the AUTORENEWAL mail group is receiving expected 
      messages.
  
   10. Confirm that the View Alerts and Notifications are occurring as 
       expected for non-renewal drugs (if enabled) and signature requests.
  
   11. Verify the Refill Count report (Mailman message).
