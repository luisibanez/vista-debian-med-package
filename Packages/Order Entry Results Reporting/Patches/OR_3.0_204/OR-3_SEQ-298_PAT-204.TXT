Subject: DO NOT ALLOW TRANSFER OF THEN CONJUNCTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Problem:
 A site reported a problem with the transfer of complex Outpatient 
 Medication orders that contained a conjunction of THEN. The problem is 
 that when the order goes (in its entirety) to Inpatient Medications there 
 is no way for the provider or the finishing pharmacist to determine how 
 far into the process the order has progressed.
  
 The patient safety workgroup recommended that transfer of Outpatient 
 medication orders with a THEN conjunction should be prevented.
  
 Resolution:
 Modified routine ORCACT0 to disallow the transfer of a complex order with 
 THEN as the conjunction.
