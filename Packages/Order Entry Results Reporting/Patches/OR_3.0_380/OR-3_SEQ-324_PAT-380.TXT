Subject: CORRECT TRANSFER MEDICATION ORDER ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an issue related to transferring a medication from 
 either Inpatient to Outpatient or vice-versa.  In specific scenarios, a 
 wrong dosage is automatically placed in the order dialog upon 
 transferring the medication resulting in a possible overdose.  
  
 For example: Suppose there is an orderable item configured with a 20 MG 
 Outpatient dosage and a 120 MG Inpatient dosage (note that there is no 20 
 MG Inpatient dosage).  If the provider attempts to transfer an Outpatient 
 medication order with the 20 MG dosage to an Inpatient medication order, 
 the 120 MG dosage is automatically selected because it contains the 
 characters "20 MG".  In this scenario, the automatic dosage selection 
 creates a 6-fold increase over the intended dosage.
  
 **********IMPORTANT NOTICE**********
  
 1. This patch is being released as an emergency patch with a non-standard 
 emergency compliance date. This is to allow the sites that have NOT 
 installed OR*3*371 (CPRS GUI V29 Follow-up Patch) to have time to get that
 installed before installing OR*3*380.
  
 2. The Pre/Post Installation Review section contains a list of sites that 
 should NOT install OR*3*380 until explicitly told to do so.
  
 3. If your site is not exempted from installation, you should install 
 OR*3*380 within 2 days of national release.

   CPRS developers have corrected this problem such that in this case the 
   dosage will be blanked out and the provider will have to enter or select
