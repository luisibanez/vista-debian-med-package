    RELATED SERVICES value stored in the quick order.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000069951 - CON/REQ UPDATED alert--add'l online info, please
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED alert description in the OE/RR NOTIFICATION
 (#100.9) file does not inform the user that the alert will be sent if a 
 consult has been Scheduled, Updated or if a comment has been added.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED description entry in the OE/RR NOTIFICATION
 (#100.9) file has been modified to the following wording:
  
   NAME: CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED
  
   DESCRIPTION: Triggered within the Consult/Request package when a comment
   is added to the consult or the consult is scheduled.  Typical recipients
   are determined by the Consult/Request package.  It is deleted upon
   completion of the follow-up action.
  
 The CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED entry in the CPRS Technical Manual (Non-GUI
 version) has been modified to the following wording:
  
   Consult/Request Updated [CONSULT/REQUEST UPDATED]
  
   Trigger: Within Consults package
   
   Mechanism: Consult package determines the consult had a comment added or
   the consult was scheduled.
  
 Note: Patch GMRC*3*71 has done a similar change to the Consult/Request
 manuals.
  
  
 2. HD0000000071077 - Quick Order (Associated Service) updating issue 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When creating a Quick order for a consult procedure, if a user makes an 
 edit to the RELATED SERVICES (#2) field in the GMRC PROCEDURE (#123.3) 
 file, the quick order does not update and the user is not allowed to 
 change the service that was originally entered, unless more than one 
 Related Services has been defined on the consult procedure. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The ORDER DIALOG (#101.41) file entries for GMRCOR REQUEST and OR GTX 
 REQUEST SERVICE have been modified to always prompt the user with the 
 service that has been saved on the quick order.  If the service is wrong, 
 they can then change it at that time.
  
  
 3. HD0000000069403 - PROMPTS POINTING TO A SUB-FILE 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users with FileMan Programmer Access get additional options when creating
 an order dialog prompt of type "pointer". The help text for the "Point to
 Which File:" prompt from the Enter/Edit Prompts option of the Order Menu
 Management [ORCM MGMT] menu option, indicates that the user can point to a
 sub-file. However, this functionality is no longer present and is not used
 by CPRS.
  
 Current help text wording:
  
    "Enter the file or subfile by name, file number, or global root 
     (without the leading '^')."
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORCMEDT4 has been modified to remove the subfile wording.
  
 New help text wording:
  
    "Enter the file by name, file number, or global root (without the
     leading '^')."
