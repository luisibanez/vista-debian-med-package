Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI 
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
  
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to OR*3*280 is included in 
 "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation Guide".   
  
 Patch information:
 PSS patches exported as two host files support CPRS v28 functionality.
 PSS_1_142.KID
 PSS_1_151.KID
  
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID includes the required patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3.0*293
 GMRC*3.0*66
 GMRA*4.0*45
  
 OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID includes the CPRS, Pharmacy and Clinical Reminders 
 patches required for CPRS GUI v28.  It includes builds for the following 
 patches: 
 OR*3.0*280
 PSJ*5.0*226
 PXRM*2.0*16
  
 CPRS28_RELATED.KID includes the related patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 GMRC*3.0*64
 GMTS*2.7*90
 OR*3.0*337
  
 Installation of these five host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected because these host files will install the software 
 needed to implement CPRS GUI v28.
  
 The purpose of this patch is to create a new centralized repository for 
 the collection of all order checking information in each VISTA instance. 
 This repository is file 100.05.  Also with this file, the patch installs 
 Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow applications 
 programmers to add any order checks that their applications generate into 
 this file.  
  
 There are no functional changes with this patch. Therefore, users should 
 see no difference in the way order checks are generated or displayed.
  
 Remedy 362006
 =============
 There is also a change made for Remedy ticket #362006.  This change is 
 to use DILOCKTM to help lock the order file record to prevent error 
 conditions.  NEXTIFN^ORCSAVE has been using locking that is not in 
 conformance with the SOP. This issue could cause RENEW+54^ORWDXR errors 
 and program crashes although the incidence rate would be very low. 
 Testing will require multiple CPRS users creating orders at the same 
 time. 
  
  
 --NOTE--
 This patch schedules a task which converts the entries that are currently 
 in file 100 on node 9 of each order and puts them into the new file 
 100.05.  This process may take a long time and thus the patch should be 
 installed when the system is not highly loaded.  Also, since the task 
 takes the current data from file 100 it is possible that control 
 characters that existed there could get copied over into the new file as 
 well. 
  
 --FURTHER NOTE--
 As the above said task will create new entries in file 100.05 based off 
 of existing order checks in file 100, file 100.05 has the potential to 
 grow to a large size.  Depending on your system configuration, this may 
 cause you to need extra journal files.  If you are monitoring the system 
 and notice you need to allocate additional system resources for this 
 task/process you may kill off the task in order to perform the necessary 
 tasks. Once you are ready you will then need to restart the process by 
 running the following at programmer prompt:
  
 D TASK^ORY293
  
 The task will pick back up where it left off when you killed off the 
 original task.
