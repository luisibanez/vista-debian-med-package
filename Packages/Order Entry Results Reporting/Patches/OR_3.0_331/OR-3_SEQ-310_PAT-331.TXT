Subject: COPYING OR RENEWING ORDERS W/STATIC DATES MAY CREATE AN ORDER WITH INVALID DATES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 4 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. Copying an order that used static dates (e.g. Jul 9, 2010) instead of  
    relative dates (e.g. T+3) may result in a new order with invalid dates.
  
 2. Renewing a generic order with static dates may result in a new order 
    with invalid dates.
  
 3. Copying a lab order with a static date results in a new order with a 
    blank date.
  
 4. Copying a lab order will not generate a duplicate check against the
    original order.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000296934 - Generic orders past stop date still active
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 --------------------
 PSPO #1223
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When copying an order, CPRS checks to see if all required fields are
 filled. If all data is filled then it will display an acknowledge form but
 does no additional checks on the fields. So, copying an order with a
 static date can result in a new order with an invalid start or stop date.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORWDXM1 has been modified to check for valid start and stop dates.
 If the dates are not valid then they are replaced with the order dialog's
 default dates and the user will see the regular form instead of the 
 acknowledge form. This is the same behavior as if the date fields were not
 filled.
  
 2. HD0000000163366 - Order contains stop date/time prior to start 
                      date/time
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When renewing an order with static dates, CPRS does not check to see if
 the dates are valid. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Originally, routine ORWDXR replaced static dates with a NOW start date and
 a blank stop date. At some point, a change to the CPRS date format broke
 this functionality. This patch fixes this functionality but now loads the
 order dialog's default dates.
  
 3. HD0000000069987 - Copy Lab orders with specific date 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Copying a lab order with a static date results in a new order with no
 collection date even though the order verification from shows the date.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORWDX2 has a line of old code that became obsolete with the 
 introduction of the order verification form. Since it's older code, it 
 only affects static dates with an internal format now only used by lab 
 orders. This code has been removed and the static date is kept as shown
 by the order verification form.
  
 4. HD0000000592195 - Copying a Lab order misses dup check on original  
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When copying a lab order, the new order does not do a duplicate check on 
 the original order. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine ORKLR is treating copying an order the same as renewing an order 
 and skips a duplicate check against the original order. Now the routine 
 will not skip duplicate checks when copying orders.
  
  
 PLEASE NOTE:
 ============
 Routine ORWDX2, distributed in this patch, references tag DOSE^PSSORUTE.
 This reference was released by patch OR*3*246 in anticipation of
 PSS*1.0*78.
  
 If OR*3*331 is installed in an account before PSS*1.0*78, XINDEX may
 display these messages:
      F - Call to this MISSING LABEL $$DOSE^PSSORUTE
      F - Call to this MISSING LABEL DOSE^PSSORUTE
 These messages can be ignored.
