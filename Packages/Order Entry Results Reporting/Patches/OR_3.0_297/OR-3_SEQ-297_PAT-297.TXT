 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000218893  Need routine to remove option/routine created by 
    OR*3*281. 
   
 Problem:
 --------      
 Patch OR*3*281 created temporary routine ORY281 and menu option 
 RADIOLOGY/IMAGING QUICK ORDER SEARCH [ORCM RA SEARCH] to assist in
 resolving an issue with Radiology Quick Orders. The routine and option are
 now obsolete and should be removed from the system.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Installing OR*3*297 deletes routine ORY281 and the RADIOLOGY/IMAGING 
 QUICK ORDER SEARCH [ORCM RA SEARCH] option.
  
   
 2) HD0000000284146  Need to remove routine created by OR*3*299.
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Patch OR*3*299 created the temporary routine ORY299 to search for 
 Outpatient Medication orders with potential problems. VA locations were
 instructed to install patch OR*3*299 as soon as possible after installing
 OR*3*243. The compliance date for OR*3*243 was Oct. 6, 2008. The routine
 ORY299 is now obsolete and should be removed from the system.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Installing OR*3*297 deletes routine ORY299. 
   
  
 3) HD0000000070004  CLE-0203-40174 Enter/edit QO Restriction: 
    Usage=Pharmacy fails.
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Entering 'PHARMACY' at the 'Usage: ' prompt does not work. Even though 
 the usage type value of 'PHARMACY' is accepted, the software does not
 respect the restriction.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The value 'PHARMACY' is never explicitly checked for in the routine that 
 processes the restriction information. This issue was presented to the
 CPRS Workgroup and their decision was that 'PHARMACY' should no longer
 be allowed as an entry at the 'Usage: ' prompt. Routine ORCMEDT6 has been
 modified to remove 'PHARMACY' as a usage type selection.
  
 To allow sites the opportunity to review orderable items that have the 
 quick order only restriction set for PHARMACY, the post-install routine 
 ORY297 searches the ORDERABLE ITEMS file (#101.43) and generates a MailMan
 message that lists the PHARMACY restricted items. The message will have 
 the subject line "ORDERABLE ITEM QUICK ORDER RESTRICTION SEARCH" and is
 sent to the person that installs the patch. Please provide this list to
 your Pharmacy ADPAC and Clinical Applications Coordinator to review 
 and, if necessary, modify the listed items. Orderable item usage and
 restriction can be edited using option Enter/edit QO restriction [ORCM QO
 ITEMS].
  
 For example: If an orderable item needs to be restricted as Quick Order 
 Only for BOTH Unit Dose and Outpatient Medications, the ADPAC would need 
 to select each of those 'Usage' types and enter a YES in the 'QO ONLY' 
 field as shown below: 
  
 Enter/edit QO restriction
 Select an ORDERABLE ITEM (meds or labs only): ALLOPURINOL TAB
  
 Select the type of usage for which you wish to restrict ordering of this 
 item.
 Usage: ?
  
 Select the type of usage for which you wish to restrict ordering of this 
 item.
 Choose from:
   NON-VA MEDICATIONS
   OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS
   UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS
  
 Usage: UNIT DOSE MEDICATIONS  <<<<
 QO ONLY: YES   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  
 Usage: OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS <<<<
 QO ONLY: YES  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
   
   
 4) HD0000000276942  Undef error when editing continuous infusion quick 
    orders.
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to edit certain continuous IV quick orders, an undefined 
 error occurred. In addition, the help text/error message would display
 twice.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine ORCDLG2 has been modified to correctly handle infusion rate text
 which is longer than allowed. Currently the limit is 30 characters 
 including the 6 character " ml/hr" text that is automatically added.
  
   
 Installation Instructions
 =========================
 This patch can be loaded with users in the system, but it is recommended 
 that it be installed when user activity is low. Installation time will be
 less than five minutes.

     INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.
   
 2.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu [XPD 
     MAIN] and select Installation.
       
 3.  From the Installation menu, you may select to use the following 
     options (When prompted for the INSTALL NAME, enter OR*3.0*297):
       
       a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will
           not backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
       b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option
           will allow you to view all changes that will be made when
           this patch is installed.  It compares all components of this
           patch (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
       c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are
