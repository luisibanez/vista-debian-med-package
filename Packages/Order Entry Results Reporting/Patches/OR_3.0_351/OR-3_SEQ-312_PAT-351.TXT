Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1. When a patient has changed clinics, they remain on the old clinic and
    are displayed as a patient on both the old and new clinic team lists.
  
 2. When listing all patients on a clinic team list, using the All
    Anticoagulation Patients [ORAM PATIENT LIST ALL] menu option,
    patients whose name begins with the letter "Z" are not displayed.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1. HD0000000484871 - Anticoagulation Issue
     
     Problem:
     --------
     When a patient changes clinics, they are not being removed from 
     the old clinic or team list. Instead, they are displayed on
     both clinics when using the All Anticoagulation Patients [ORAM PATIENT
     LIST ALL] menu option.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORAM1 has been modified to correctly update the cross 
     reference when the clinic listed for a patient in the ORAM 
     FLOWSHEET file (#103) changes. Previously, the old cross 
     reference was being left behind, leaving the patient associated 
     with the old clinic. The team lists will be corrected the 
     next time Anticoagulation Background Job [ORAM SET TEAMLISTS]
     background job is ran.
  
  
  2. HD0000000497460 - Problem is Anticoagulator Report -- VISTA
     
     Problem:
     --------
     When listing all patients on a clinic team list using All
     Anticoagulation Patients [ORAM PATIENT LIST ALL] menu option,
     patients whose last name begins with the letter "Z" are not displayed.
     The current ORAM TEAM LIST sort template is sorting patient names from
     A to Z. This is problematic because ending at "Z" will not include
     names after "Z" (ex. patient "Z" will show up, but patient "ZA" will
     not).
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The ORAM TEAM LIST sort template has been modified to remove the
     limits on names for sorting. Now when listing all patients on a 
     clinic team list, using the All Anticoagulation Patients [ORAM
     PATIENT LIST ALL] menu option, patient whose last names begin with
     "Z", will now be displayed. The team lists will be corrected the 
     next time Anticoagulation Background Job [ORAM SET TEAMLISTS]
     background job is ran.
  
  TECHNICAL SECTION:
  ==================
  Post-init routine ORP351 was created with this patch to rebuild the "CL"
  cross-reference of the ORAM FLOWSHEET file (#103). This will correct the
  associated team lists the next time Anticoagulation Background Job [ORAM 
  SET TEAMS] runs.
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
