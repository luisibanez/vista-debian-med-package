Subject: PATIENT NAMES DROPPING OFF LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects one issue within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 When selecting patients by clinic in the Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS) the user can specify a date range to list appointments for
 selection. When there are more than 200 appointments within the selected
 date range, some of the appointments are not displayed for selection.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000107869 - Patient names dropping off list
  
 Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #1693 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When selecting patients by clinic in CPRS the user can specify a date
 range to list appointments for selection. Before patch OR*3*187, when the
 number of appointments for the date range exceeded 200 the message "Too
 many appointments found. Please narrow search range" would display to the
 user. Patch OR*3*187 modified the selection of patients by clinic
 appointment to use the new scheduling API's. Unfortunately this change
 inadvertently overwrote the user message. When the number of appointments
 within the date range exceeded 200, the list was sorted by internal entry
 number (IEN) when it truncated. Since the IEN is never displayed to
 the user, the truncation behavior made no sense. The appointments dropped
 were from any part of the date range due to the IEN sort order. The user
 received no indication that the maximum displayable number had been 
 reached and generally unaware that not all appointments within the date 
 range were being displayed. 
  
 Appointments were also being dropped when the user has defined a patient 
 selection default list with a combination of sources with one or more
 clinics in the source list. A combination list uses the default start and
 stop date range defined in the patient selection default in Lists/Teams.
 The default combination patient selection list can only display 200
 appointments from each clinic. As with selecting patients by clinic, when
 the number of appointments within the default date range exceeded 200 for
 the clinic in the combination list, the user received no indication that
 the maximum displayable number had been reached for that clinic and
 generally unaware that not all appointments within the date range were
 being displayed.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORQPTQ2 has been modified to use SDAPI^SDAMA301 which can 
 truncate by appointment date. When the number of clinic appointments 
 within the date range exceeds 200, the earliest appointments in the date 
 range will display for selection and a new message will display at the top
 of the patient selection list.
  
 Example of new message:
  
 *** UNABLE TO SHOW ALL APPOINTMENTS *** 
 Showing the first 200 appointments from Mar 01, 2012 to Mar 16, 2012 
 Modify the appointment list date range to start on Mar 17, 2012 to see 
 additional appointments.
 (end of message)
  
 The appointment list date range for clinics is designed to query for full
 dates, so when the search results exceed 200 appointments the display will
 end with the last appointment of the last day before the maximum
 displayable count is reached. Because of this, the number of appointments
 ("200" in the example) will change to the exact number of displayed
 appointments.
  
 In addition, when the user has defined a combination of sources with one
 or more clinics in their patient selection defaults, routine ORQPTQ6 has 
 been modified to display the following message when the number of clinic
 appointments within the date range exceeds 200:
  
 *** UNABLE TO SHOW ALL APPOINTMENTS *** 
 Showing only the first 200 appointments from [Clinic Name]
 Showing only the first 200 appointments from [2nd Clinic Name] 
 Reduce The Date Range By Changing The Stop Date Of The Patient Selection 
 Defaults To T-##.
 (end of message) 
  
 In the user defined patient selection default list with a combination
 of sources, when the search results exceed 200 appointments and the 
 message above displays, the list will display exactly 200 appointments for
 that clinic. The ad-hoc query in the patient selection window is not
 designed to handle multiple clinics, therefore the warning 
 message asks the user to modify the patient selection defaults.
 The T-## at the end of the second message: ## is the T minus one day of
 appointment number 200's date from the first clinic reaching 200
 appointments in the search results. Entering this value as the default
 stop date will create a shorter default list with no clinics reaching
 the 200 count maximum.
