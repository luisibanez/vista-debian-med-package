Subject: INCOMPLETE PATIENT MOVEMENT EVENTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues.
 When a patient is discharged using the DG DISCHARGE PATIENT [Discharge 
 a Patient] option and the user, at the Review Delayed Orders
 prompt, enters "^^" or lets the system timeout, the discharge process does
 not fully complete. Once the Review Delayed Orders prompt is exited in one
 of the ways described above, processes that are supposed to take place
 during the discharge don't happen. This is causing some orders to not
 discontinue.
  
 Also, it was discovered that if a patient is discharged and only has
 pharmacy and/or dietetic orders, the auto discontinue of these orders are
 not being recorded in the OE/RR PATIENT EVENT file (#100.2). There is also
 a rare circumstance in which, if the user discharging the patient is
 assigned to a different division than the location of the ward, the entry
 to the OE/RR PATIENT EVENT file (#100.2) is not created.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000318868 - PSPO#1505 - 3 Upon patient discharge...patient's 
                      orders are NOT auto-DCing
   
   Problem:
   --------
   When discharging a patient, using the DG DISCHARGE PATIENT [Discharge 
   a Patient] option and the user at the prompt "Review Delayed Orders" 
   enters "^^" or lets the system time out, diet orders will not
   auto discontinue because the discharge does not fully complete. This is
   a problem with the quitting flags being left behind.
   
   Resolution:
   ------------
   Routine ORCACT3 has been modified so that when protocol ORU REVIEW 
   DELAYED ORDERS is called from protocol DGPM MOVEMENT EVENTS (this
   happens on a patient movement) the VA Fileman flags that determine if
   the user entered a string containing "^" or timed out are reset. This is
   to ensure that the previous answer to the "Review Delayed Orders" prompt
   does not affect the auto-discontinue of the orders.
   
 2. HD0000000259335 - 5 CPRS issue
   
   Problem:
   --------
   When the only orders auto-discontinued during a patient movement are 
   pharmacy and/or dietetic orders they are erroneously not recorded in the
   OE/RR PATIENT EVENT file (#100.2). There is also a situation in which an
   auto-discontinue rule is not found and applied when it should be. This
   will only happen if the patient is being discharged from a ward whose
   location is different than the location of the person who is doing the
   discharge.  Upon discharge, the system will look at the ward location at
   discharge to determine the division. That division is used to determine
   if an auto-DC rule should be applied.  If the user's division is
   different than the division assigned to the ward location at discharge
   then the rule will not be found and applied.
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ORMEVNT was modified to use the correct variable that holds 
   the ward location of the discharge institution, which will then be
   used to identify and apply an auto-DC rule. Routine ORMEVNT1 was
   modified to check to see if an entry exists in file OE/RR PATIENT EVENT
   (100.2) before adding the orders auto-DCed by pharmacy and/or
   dietetics.  If no entry is found in file OE/RR PATIENT EVENT (100.2)
   (implying that no orders were auto-DCed by the CPRS process) then an
   entry is created and the package specific orders are recorded.
