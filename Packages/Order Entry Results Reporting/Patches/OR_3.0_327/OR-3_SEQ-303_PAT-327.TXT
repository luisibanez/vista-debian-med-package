Description:
============

 This patch corrects 4 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING

  4. When renewing an order with an invalid/changed schedule, IV orders 
     are not properly verified.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  1. HD0000000377325 - SHWTLT+10^XPAREDT3 Error
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Selecting the GUI Reports User Display Parameters [ORQP REPORT USER 
     PARAM] option causes a SHWTLT+10^XPAREDT3 Error.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     An empty sequence in the ORQP REPORT RANGE (USER) parameter template 
     is causing the crash. Deleting the sequence fixes the problems.
  
  2. HD0000000069559 - PUG-1101-51042  Can't change user values-Report 
                       parameters 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The GUI Reports User Display Parameters [ORQP REPORT USER PARAM]
     option does not allow user selection.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Unlike the other options in the GUI Parameters [ORW PARAM GUI] menu
     that modifies user level parameters, ORQP REPORT USER PARAM is sending
     the current user's record number in its entry action. Removing the
     record number causes the parameter editor to prompt for a user.
  
  3. HD0000000300224 - LAB QUICK ORDER
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When building a quick order the How long field does not correctly 
     apply the Max days limit when using Xnumber of times format. A quick 
     order using a Q4H schedule with a Max days limit of 3 will reject an
     entry of X4 (equivalent to 4 repeated orders) with the message 
     "Cannot order for more than 3 days." The field seems to not recognize 
     the X prefix and is calculating for days.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A modification to ORCDLR broke how the SHOWMAX tag was loading the 
     Frequency field which in turn made the CHKMAX tag unable to verify 
     entries using the Xnumber of times format.
     
  4. HD0000000406792 - Standard Schedule (Changed) Creates Endless 
                       Loop for Finishing Pharmacist
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When renewing an order in Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
     after the schedule's name has been changed, the user should be
     presented with a warning message telling them that the schedule for
     this order is not valid and the renewal process is cancelled.  
     However, if the order is an IV with a schedule, this warning does not
     occur and the user is allowed to renew the order, despite the fact
     that the schedule is not valid.
  
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Changed ORWNSS so that the system checks for the IV display group as
     well as the Unit Dose display group.
