Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Anticoagulation Management Tool (AMT), released in patch OR*3*307, is 
 a tool within the Computerized Patient Record System Graphical User 
 Interface (CPRS GUI) which enables the user to enter, review, and
 continuously update all information connected with patient anticoagulation
 management.
  
 OR*3.0*339 is the first maintenance patch for the Anticoagulation 
 Management Tool and resolves the following 9 issues:
  
 1.  When a non-Provider (e.g., Student, Pharmacy Tech, etc.) is exiting 
     the Anticoagulation module, the system no longer prompts for them to
     identify the primary provider for the encounter.
  
 2.  The ICD-9 code is not displayed for patients who have had the ICD-9 
     code entered on a previous visit.
  
 3.  Anticoagulation Consult requests with the status of Scheduled are not
     completed when an Initial Note is filed.
  
 4.  When the user modifies the Current Daily Dosing and modifies the Pill
     Strength, it is possible that the daily doses will be incorrectly
     recalculated.
  
 5.  When the user attempts to enroll a patient in the Anticoagulation
     module and the patient's most recent International Normalized Ratio  
     (INR) was cancelled, an <UNDEFINED> error is encountered.
  
 6.  When the user edits the number of tablets in Current Daily Dosing, it
     is possible to have a zero appended to the end of the number,
     significantly changing the desired dosage.
  
 7.  INR results may cause a <DIVIDE> error in the Rosendaal Report in 
     VistA.
  
 8.  Changes to the Clinic Name for a patient visit in the Anticoagulation
     module are not saved if this is the only change made and the user 
     clicks on the Save/Exit button.
  
 9.  The Anticoagulation module does not allow a Draw date on weekends.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD0000000392179 - Wrong name submit as Primary 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a non-Provider (e.g., Student, Intern, Technician, etc.) uses the
     Anticoagulator to document their encounter, the resulting Visit in PCE
     is left with an invalid Primary Provider (i.e., the Student) and data 
     transmitted to Austin errors off due to the missing Primary Provider.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The client- and server-side code were modified to assure that the 
     provider identified by the student/intern as cosigner on the note or 
     provider for the orders is also sent to the PCE API as the Primary 
     Provider for the encounter.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000396046 - Other Dx not saving ICD 9 code
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When the user selects "Other" for the "Add'l Indication" field and
     manually enters the "ICD-9 code", the visit is properly credited and
     the diagnostic code is properly stored. However, it is not retrieved
     and presented correctly when the patient returns for subsequent
     visits, which then causes the data sent to Austin to be rejected due
     to an incomplete encounter.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The client-side code was modified to assign the ICD-9 code stored on a
     prior encounter to the appropriate variable when the indication for
     care was "Other."
  
     Note: This Remedy ticket has 2 parts; The first part is addressed by 
     this patch and the second part is addressed in patch OR*3*330,
     released 10/18/2010.
  
 3.  HD0000000404437 - Scheduling Consult Issue 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Anticoagulation Consult requests with the status of 'Scheduled' are
     not completed when an Initial Note is filed like requests with a
     status of 'Pending' or 'Active' are.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified the server-side code that retrieves the list of consult 
     requests to match with an initial anticoagulation note to include 
     requests with a status of 'scheduled' in addition to 'pending' or 
     'active' consults.
  
 4.  HD0000000418906 - Problem with auto calculation 
  
     Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #1813
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If the user is modifying the daily dosing on the Enter Information 
     tab and elects to change the pill strength, without clicking OK or 
     Cancel, the daily doses will be incorrectly recalculated when the 
     user tabs or clicks away from the pill strength edit box.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The anomaly results from the interaction between the code that gets 
     executed on exit from the pill strength edit box and the code that 
     gets invoked when the contents of the daily dosing edit boxes change. 
     This can only occur when both the Pill Strength and the Daily Dosing 
     edit boxes are enabled (i.e., editable).
  
     The solution which was implemented is to toggle the enabled property 
     of the Pill Strength edit box off when the user is changing the daily 
     dosing, and back on when the user either submits or cancels the 
     changes.
  
 5.  HD0000000420035 - Anticoagulation - a tech is trying to add a patient
                       for a next week app but errors out. 
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If the user attempts to enroll a patient in the AMT whose most recent
     INR was cancelled, the following error will occur:
  
     $ZE= <UNDEFINED>COMPTEST+6^ORAM1 *X
  
     The AMT remains open, but its connection is lost, and the session
     can't be recovered.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The error above occurred in DT^DILF, which accepts an internal-format
     FileMan date/time and returns the external-format date/time. In the
     case above, the input string to DT^DILF was empty so it returned an
     empty string which caused the UNDEFINED error.
     The code was modified to accommodate an empty string for the draw
     date/time, allowing the code to proceed without error.
  
 6.  HD0000000424310 - Changing Tablets in Daily Dosaging 
  
     Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #1823
  
     Problem:
     --------
     If the user deletes the number of tablets in the Change Daily Dosing
     function of the AMT of CPRS, the field is populated with a zero and
     the cursor is positioned in front of the zero.  If the user then
     enters a number, the zero remains appended to the number, 
     significantly changing the value of the number (i.e., '2' becomes
     '20').
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified the OnChange event handler for the dosing grid to assure that
     a zero would only be left for the number of tablets if the user
     entered nothing else.
  
 7.  HD0000000439690 - Rosendaal Report gets <DIVIDE> Error Under Certain
                       Conditions
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When a patient has two consecutive INRs which are identical, one 
     in-range and one out-range, due to goal range change, a division by 
     zero error occurs in the Rosendaal Report in VistA.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Logic in routine ORAMTTR has been modified to account for the 
     difference of two INRs being zero and calculate accordingly.
      
 8.  HD0000000439776 - Changes to Patient Location not Saved Unless 
                       Complete Visit is Recorded 
   
     Problem:
     --------
     Changes to the Clinic Name for a patient visit in the AMT are not
     saved if this is the only change made and the user clicks on the
     Save/Exit button.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The code on both the client and server was modified to accommodate 
     saving the patient location when the Save & Exit button is clicked.  
     
 9.  HD0000000439782 - Can't Order INRs or CBCs for Weekend Collection
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Some sites have asked for the ability to specify a Draw Date on 
     weekends.  Currently, the Anticoagulation module does not allow the
     user to specify a Draw Date on a Saturday or Sunday for INR or CBC
     (complete blood count ) orders. If the user attempts to do so, the
     application will automatically increment the collection date to the
     following Monday.
     
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The application was modified to inform the user that the date they 
     have selected for the Draw Date is a Saturday or Sunday, and allow
     them to leave it or change it, as they deem appropriate.
