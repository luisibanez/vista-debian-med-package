 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000152901 - Custom Order View not saving correctly
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When selecting a custom order view on the CPRS orders tab, relative 
     dates are not saving time.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORWOR has been modified to allow the time in a relative 
     date/time to be saved.
  
  
  
 2. HD0000000290180 - Surgery Reports using Vista Web display incorrect 
                      surgery specialty for non-OR cases.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Some fields on clinical surgery reports are being carried over from a 
     previous report. If there were two items on the surgery report, 
     one of which had a surgical specialty, and the other did not, the 
     first surgical specialty would hang over into the incorrect item.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Modified routine ORWSR to correctly use FileMan calls and to clear 
     variables. This will prevent data hangovers.
  
  
 3. HD0000000440138 - Delayed orders - Copy Active Orders
  
     Problem:
     --------
     When creating a new patient movement event in CPRS, recently 
     discontinued orders are showing up in the "Copy active orders for 
     selected event" dialog.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine OREVNTX1 has been modified to filter out orders which 
     have a status of discontinued, complete, expired, and cancelled
     from the "Copy active orders for selected event" dialog.
  
      
 4. HD0000000463465 - Requesting clarification on "Signature Not 
                      Required" for discontinued telephone order.
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Search orders by Nature or Status [OR NATURE/STATUS ORDER SEARCH] 
     report is displaying orders that contain the searched for nature of 
     order in any action. This report should only be searching for the 
     last action.
     For example, if you have an order that was released with a nature of 
     order value of telephoned, but then was changed due to service 
     correction, and is now not yet released, this order will show up as 
     active when you search for Telephoned and unsigned when you search 
     for service correction.
   
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine ORSNAST2 has been modified so that the Search orders by 
     Nature or Status [OR NATURE/STATUS ORDER SEARCH] report now only 
     looks at the current status (last action) of the order and correctly 
     displays the results.
