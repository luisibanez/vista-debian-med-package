Subject: PROBLEM WITH ORPF AUTO UNFLAG PARAMETER AND FLAG ORDER NOTIFICATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects 2 issues within the ORDER ENTRY/RESULTS REPORTING 
 package:
  
 1. When the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter is set to YES and a Provider 
    processes the FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION notification, in certain 
    situations other flagged orders for the patient are erroneously
    unflagged.
  
 2. A flagged order recipient doesn't receive the FLAG ORDER FOR 
    CLARIFICATION notification if another order for the same patient has 
    just been flagged to a different Provider.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000378709 - CPRS - Medication Errors
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter is set to YES and a Provider 
 processes a single FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION notification, other 
 flagged orders for the patient are erroneously unflagged. When a patient 
 has multiple orders flagged to different Providers and one of the 
 Providers processes his displayed FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION 
 notification, the orders tab opens to the Orders View 'All Services, 
 Flagged'. Only the orders flagged to this Provider are displayed. When 
 the Provider refreshed the patient information or selects a new patient, 
 the flagged orders that were displayed are automatically unflagged. The 
 problem is that ALL of the patient's flagged orders are being unflagged, 
 not just the ones assigned to this Provider. The other Providers that had 
 this patient's orders flagged to them still have the FLAG ORDER FOR 
 CLARIFICATION notification, but when they select and process the 
 notification no orders display in the Orders View "All Services, 
 Flagged", since none of the patient's orders are still flagged. 
                                    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter is set to YES and a Provider 
 processes a FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION notification, only the orders 
 that displayed in the Orders View 'All Services, Flagged' for that 
 provider will be auto unflagged.
  
 2. HD0000000447412 - Flagged order recipient doesn't see alert
  
 Background:
 -----------
 When the MESSGAGE TYPE (#.04) field in the OE/RR NOTIFICATION 
 (#100.9) FILE contains the value 'NOT', notifications are not 
 generated if the same notification has already been generated for the
 patient in the same minute. The rationale is that we do not want to
 display two notifications with same date, time and message. The exception
 to this rule is that two orders with different ordering providers will
 generate separate notifications because the notifications potentially have
 different recipients.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The OE/RR Notification "FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION" differs from
 other 'NOT' message types in that the user can select a recipient in
 addition to the Primary Care Provider (PCP) or Ordering provider.
  
 If the user flags two orders for different recipients within the same 
 minute and both orders have the same ordering provider, then the second
 notification (meant for recipient B) will not be generated; and 
 recipient B will not receive the expected "FLAG ORDER FOR CLARIFICATION" 
 notification.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A flagged order notification will now be generated if the successive
 recipient is different from the recipient flagged for the prior order
 that was just flagged.
  
 The Informatics Patient Safety office has recognized that patch OR*3*329 
 corrects the unflagging problem warned about with Patient Safety 
 Alert (PSA) AL10-12 distributed June 30, 2010. PSA AL10-12 instructed VA
 facilities to set the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG parameter value to NO. After
 installing patch OR*3*329, PSA AL10-12 is no longer effective and
 sites can set parameter ORPF AUTO UNFLAG to YES if so desired.
  
 -  If the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG = YES: When a user processes a flagged order(s)
 alert, all the orders flagged for that provider (for the specified 
 patient) will be automatically unflagged. Orders flagged to other 
 providers (for the same patient) will not be unflagged. 
  
 -  If the ORPF AUTO UNFLAG = NO: When a user processes a flagged order(s) 
 alert, no orders are unflagged.  The alert remains until the user 
 manually unflags all orders belonging to him or her (for the specified 
 patient).
