Subject: DISPENSE DRUG ISSUES,COMPLEX ORDER ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Computerized Patient 
 Record System (CPRS) package:
   
 1. If the dispensed drug is changed when an inpatient medication order is
    finished by pharmacy there may be no indication visible on the CPRS
    Order Tab View Orders or Meds tab that a change has been made. The new
    drug is only displayed in the "Dispensed Drug" text of the order 
    detail.
  
 2. Remove routine created by OR*3*268.
  
 3. If pharmacy changes the drug while processing an outpatient medication
    order there may be no indication visible on the CPRS Order Tab View 
    Orders view or Meds tab that a change has been made. The new drug is
    only displayed in the "Dispensed Drug" text of the order detail.
  
 4. Large complex outpatient orders erroneously indicate a change has been 
    made by pharmacy when viewed on the CPRS Order Tab View Orders when 
    no change was actually made.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000102172 -RENEWAL ORDER PRINTING WRONG DISPENSE DRUG
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #205
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When pharmacy [PSJ OE] changes the dispensed drug of an inpatient 
 medication order, and no other fields are changed, this edit may not be
 recognized by the order entry software as a service correction or change
 to the order when viewed again in CPRS. This problem is most noticeable
 with medications dispensed as inhalants or drops. The dispensed drug
 entered by pharmacy displays in the CPRS order detail view in the
 "Dispensed Drugs (units/dose):" field, but without a change indicator to
 prompt the user to view the order detail, this information could be missed
 and patients could receive incorrect doses.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORMPS2 has been modified to recognize a change to the dispensed 
 drug by pharmacy as a service correction. In CPRS, when in View Orders 
 view, the medication will be preceded by an asterisk (*) indicating that 
 the order was changed as a service correction, and a new entry in the 
 order's activity log will record the change. In some instances, depending 
 on the medication ordered, the medication information displayed in View 
 Orders will update to include the dispensed drug information.  
  
  
 2. HD0000000258432 - Remove routine created in OR*3*268
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patch OR*3.0*268 created the temporary routine ORY268 to produce a 
 one-time MailMan message that reported when updating completed for the 
 NAME field (#.01) and the MESSAGE TEXT field (#.03) of two OE/RR 
 NOTIFICATIONS: IMAGING RESULTS, NON CRITICAL and ABNL IMAGING RESLT, NEED 
 ATTN. The compliance date for OR*3*268 was October 6, 2009. Routine 
 ORY268 is now obsolete and should be removed from the system.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Installing OR*3*363 deletes routine ORY268 if it is present.
  
  
 3. HD0000000618076 - MIS-MATCH BETWEEN ORDER TAB CPRS AND ACTUAL SIG
   
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #2250
   
 Problem:
 --------
 When processing an outpatient medication order, if pharmacy [PSO LM 
 BACKDOOR] dispenses a different strength of tablet with a different 
 number of tablets to take, keeping the total dosage unchanged, there 
 may be no indication visible on the CPRS Order Tab View Orders view or
 Meds tab that a change has been made. The new strength and number is only
 displayed in the "Dispensed Drug" text of the order detail, but without a 
 change indicator to prompt the user to view the order detail, it is 
 possible that a patient could be given the incorrect dose information 
 displayed in the View Orders view. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine ORMPS2 has been modified to recognize a change to the strength of 
 the medication and number of tablets to take as a service correction. In 
 CPRS, when in View Orders, the medication will be preceded by an asterisk 
 (*) indicating that the order was changed as a service correction, and a 
 new entry in the order's activity log will record the change. The new 
 medication strength and number of tablets to take will be displayed in
 View Orders on the Orders and Meds tab, and also in the order details.
  
 4. HD0000000735586 - Canceling a complex order change creates an unwanted
    action in CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When pharmacy [PSO LM BACKDOOR] finishes a large complex outpatient order 
 (at least 3 lines), or aborts an edit to an active large complex
 outpatient order, when the order is viewed again in CPRS on the Order Tab
 View Orders view and Meds tab the medication is preceded by an asterisk
 (*) and an entry in the order's activity log is recorded as if a change
 was made, when in fact, no change was actually made.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The HL7 returned from PSO was longer than expected resulting in one piece 
 getting pushed to another segment, causing the record to be evaluated as 
 a change. The code has been changed to use the $$FIND^ORM API to find the 
 quantity and refill codes in the HL7 message so the evaluation is done on 
 the correct values.
