Subject: MOCHA 2 QUICK ORDER REPORTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 IMPORTANT NOTE:  As directed by the Secretary of the Department of 
 Veterans Affairs, this patch is being released with a 24 hour compliance 
 date for installation.
  
 This patch adds two new reports to the Order Menu Management Option.  
 These reports will list quick orders whose resulting orders will not 
 participate in Max Single Dose Checks.  Pharmacy Informatics and Clinical 
 Application Coordinators should jointly review these reports and edit the 
 quick orders listed.  This data cleanup is an integral part of the site's 
 readiness to install and implement the Medication Order Check Healthcare 
 Application (MOCHA) 2.0.  Documentation on this data cleanup process is 
 available at http://go.va.gov/hmbz as well as the updated CPRS List 
 Manager Technical Manual.
  
 Quick Order Mixed-Case Report [OR QO CASE REPORT]
 =================================================
 This report identifies quick orders that have potentially had the DRUG 
 name edited such that when the quick order is loaded in CPRS the dosage 
 that is saved with the quick order does not match any of the dosages 
 available for selection in the list. This causes the dosage checks not to 
 be able to be performed correctly.  The edit to the drug that this 
 specifically looks for is a case change to the DRUG name.  If the name is 
 changed so that it contains different characters that are not just case 
 changes, this report will not identify them.
  
 Quick Order Free-Text Report [OR QO FREETEXT REPORT]
 ====================================================
 This report identifies Medication Quick orders that have a free text 
 dosage that does not match exactly one of the possible dosages or local 
 possible dosages from Pharmacy.
