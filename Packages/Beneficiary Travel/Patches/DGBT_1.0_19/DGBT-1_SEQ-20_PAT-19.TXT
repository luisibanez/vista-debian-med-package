Subject: Beneficiary Travel Dashboard 1.0

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  
 The purpose of the Beneficiary Travel Dashboard (BTD) web application is 
 to assist Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Travel Office users who 
 create travel claims make faster, more accurate decisions on mileage 
 reimbursement. 
  
 This patch provides the infrastructure for the BTD web application which 
 is installed as a client on the user's personal computer (PC).
  
 This patch should be installed by the compliance date, but installation 
 of the web components will be phased according to the implementation 
 schedule.  One web server will be configured per region.  Installation of 
 the web and MUMPS components will be coordinated by the regional Service 
 Line Manager (SLM), between the Information Resource Manager (IRM), local 
 system managers and local Beneficiary Travel staff.  Training information 
 will be sent to facilities prior to usage by travel clerks.  Depending on 
 where your region falls in the implementation schedule, the BT Dashboard 
 web application may be implemented shortly after installing this patch, 
 or it may be farther in the future.
  
 Refer to the Beneficiary Travel Dashboard Installation Guide and User 
 manual for instructions on installing and using web components of this 
 application.
  
 BT Dashboard is a web-based application that displays a configurable list 
 of the closest VHA facilities, as well as the clinical specialties 
 offered at each facility, based on configuration in the new VistA  
 Beneficiary Travel Dashboard Config File #392.5, installed with this 
 patch. All of the data displayed in BT Dashboard is provided by the VistA 
 Beneficiary Travel system and no data is entered via the BT Dashboard web 
 application. 
  
 When configured, the clinical specialties can be viewed by selecting the 
 facility name. BT Dashboard also displays patient appointments, notes, 
 orders, consults, past claims and calculates the driving mileage from the 
 patient's address to a configured set of VHA institutions. The BT 
 Dashboard application automatically synchronizes with travel claims as 
 they are created in VistA using the beneficiary travel claim menu.

 The Edit the BT Dashboard configuration file [DGBT BENE TRAVEL 
 CONFIG EDIT] option will be used by the ADPAC to add the institution and 
 specialty data.  The DGBT SUPERVISOR KEY is required to access this 
 option.
  
 The ADPAC or user can add entries to the VA Institution and Non-VA 
 Institution multiples. The Non-VA Institution multiple is a free text 
 field that can be used to track institutions that are not in the 
 Institution file #4. Institution to Track and Specialty multiples can be 
 entered under each multiple. This data will appear beside the mileage in 
 BT Dashboard.
  
 a.      Institution to Track points to the Institution file (#4)
 b.      Specialty is a free text field and multiple specialties can be 
 added for each institution. It is not required, but can be used to store 
 services offered and notes about the institution.
  
 Note: The Alternate Address field in the VA Institution multiple is 
 necessary only if the application returns 0 mileage for the site (i.e. 
 the address in the Institution file #4 cannot be resolved by the mapping 
 API used by BT Dashboard).
  
 BT Dashboard Configuration
 ----------------------------
  
 Use the VistA option Edit the BT Dashboard configuration file [DGBT BENE 
 TRAVEL CONFIG EDIT] to add a single entry to the BENEFICIARY 
 TRAVEL DASHBOARD CONFIG File (#392.5).
  
 Note:  There should be only one entry in the BENEFICIARY TRAVEL 
 DASHBOARD CONFIG file (#392.5) and its internal entry number (IEN) 
 should be '1'.
  
 To ensure that the IEN is '1', an Information Resource Management (IRM) 
 programmer or other staff member can initially create one "stub" entry 
 in the new Beneficiary Travel Dashboard Config file #392.5 and verify 
 that its IEN is '1'. The Name field (#.01) only can be entered to create
 the record. Use either the Edit the BT Dashboard Configuration file 
 [DGBT BENE TRAVEL CONFIG EDIT] option or FileMan ENTER OR EDIT FILE 
 ENTRIES to add the entry.
  
 Sample Beneficiary Travel Dashboard Configuration session using the Edit 
 the BT Dashboard Configuration file [DGBT BENE TRAVEL CONFIG EDIT] option
 from programmer mode to enter a "stub" entry:

 There should be only one entry. Its IEN will be labeled "NUMBER" in the
 display and its value should be '1'.

 The ADPAC or supervisor can then complete the configuration work by 
 adding entries to the VA Institution and Non-VA Institution multiples.
  
 The Non-VA Institution multiple is a free text field that can be used to 
 track institutions that are not in the Institution file #4. Institution 
 to Track and Specialty multiples can be entered under each. The list of
 specialties will appear in BT Dashboard when the user clicks on the 
 mileage figure next to the institution.
 a.      Institution to Track points to the Institution file (#4)
 b.      Specialty is a free text field and multiple specialties can be 
 added for each institution. This field is not required, but can also be
 used to store services offered and notes about the institution.
  
 Note: The Alternate Address field in the VA Institution multiple is 
 necessary only if the application returns 0 mileage or incorrect mileage
 for the site (i.e., the address in the Institution file #4 cannot be
 resolved by the mapping API used by BT Dashboard).
