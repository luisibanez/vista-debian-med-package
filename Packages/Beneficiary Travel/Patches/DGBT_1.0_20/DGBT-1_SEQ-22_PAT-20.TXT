Description:
============

  
  This patch has enhancements which extend the capabilities of the Veterans
  Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) 
  Beneficiary Travel application.
  
  THE FOLLOWING CHANGES MUST BE MADE TO THE BENEFICIARY TRAVEL ACCOUNT 
  FILE 392.3 PRIOR TO INSTALLING THIS PATCH.  The Beneficiary Travel 
  Supervisor or ADPAC should make these changes through the Bene Travel 
  Account file Enter/Edit [DGBT BENE TRAVEL ACCOUNT] option which is locked
  with the DGBT SUPERVISOR key:
      A. THE SITE NEEDS TO DE-ACTIVATE ALL ACCOUNTS FOR MILEAGE CLAIMS 
         THAT ARE NOT OF TYPE 4 (ALL OTHER) OR TYPE 5 (C&P), OR IF A SITE 
         PREFERS TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT THAT IS NOT TYPE 4 OR 5 ACTIVE, THEY
         CAN CHANGE THAT ACCOUNT TYPE TO 4 OR 5. A SITE CAN HAVE MORE THAN
         1 ACCOUNT OF EACH TYPE 4 AND TYPE 5 BUT THE DEFAULT WILL BE THE
         FIRST ACTIVE ACCOUNT TYPE OF 4 (ALL OTHER).
  
      B. A SITE CAN HAVE ONLY ONE ACTIVE SPECIAL MODE ACCOUNT TYPE 
         (TYPE 3). IT MUST CONTAIN THE EXACT VERBIAGE "SPECIAL MODE -
         NON-EMERGEN" IN THE TEXT FOR THE ACCOUNT TYPE. 
         ALL OTHER TYPE 3'S MUST BE DE-ACTIVATED.

  This patch includes the following enhancements:
  
  (1) Provides End Users with an accounting method for Special Mode 
  Transportation Authorization and Special Mode Transportation Vendor 
  Billing.
  
  (2) Provides national tracking of BT Deductibles in a calendar month, and
   allows the BT System to count the number of trips and amount of 
   deductible paid during the current month at all sites the patient has 
   visited during the current month. Credits the trips to the deductible
   cap for the current month.
  
  (3) Allows the user to enter 2 different types of waivers to waive a 
  patient's deductible amount:
       a. Alternate Income Waiver - this is entered through the BT 
          Alternate Income Enter/Edit option, and covers two status types,
          Hardship and POW.
          A patient would be given a Hardship waiver if they have a current
          Means Test or RX Co-Pay test on file and their income or other
          situation has created a temporary financial hardship determined 
          by the BT clerk. Alternate income for a hardship case
          will expire at the end of the current year.
  
          Normally the Registration/Enrollment system does not allow Means 
          tests or RX-CoPay tests to be entered  for POW's as they are
          automatically waived by the system for any visit deductible or
          copays. But POW's are  not automatically eligible for travel
          reimbursement. If a BT clerk determines a POW is below the low
          income threshold this can now be entered through the BT Alternate
          Income Enter/Edit option, and the deductible will be waived. 
          Alternate Income for a POW will expire 365 days from
          date of entry.
  
       b. "Manual Waiver" - entered through the new Manual Deductible 
          Waiver option as a catch all determined by the BT clerk. A 
          patient can be entered into the Manual Deductible Waiver option
          if the clerk first determines they are considered below the
          low income threshold, but this information is not stored 
          elsewhere in the Registration/Enrollment package. This waiver
          will expire at the end of the current year.
   
   The "manual" waiver is automatically retrieved, transparently to the 
   user, at any other site while creating or editing a claim. It can only
   be edited by the site that created the original "manual" Waiver.
  
  
  (4) Standardizing Authorized BT Waiver to Expire. If the Veteran has an 
  authorized waiver of the deductible in effect a message will display to 
  alert the user to when the waiver expires.
  The waivers expire as follows:
      a. If the Veteran receives any type of Pension the message "PENSION"
         will display.
      b. If the Veteran qualifies because the income is below the Low
         Income Threshold, based on the Means Test or RX-Copay test, the
         message will display the date the Means Test or RX-Copay test
         expires.
      c. All others will expire at the end of the current year.
  
  (5) Automatically identifies Veterans who meet administrative criteria as
   BT Eligible.
  
  (6) The Claim Enter/Edit option will automatically update the Veteran's 
  BT Claim Income Fields if a valid, completed MT or Co-Pay test exists.
  
  (7) Displays current address based on data in Patient file.
  
  (8) Provides new features to deny a claim, document the reason,
  and print and reprint a Denial of Benefits Letter that includes the
  Veteran's Appellate Rights if a veteran has been denied BT Benefits. 
  
  (9) Provides local-level reporting. All reports can either be printed or
 exported to a Excel file.
 There are new 6 BT reports as follows:
      Summary Report
      Audit Report
      Clerk Report  
      Travel Pattern Report  
      Special Mode Report
      Fiscal Report
  
  (10) Changes the VA Form 70-354d, Cash Reimbursement of BT Expenses, to
  include Number of Trips and Deductible Amount Paid at all sites the
  Veteran has visited within the current month.
  
  (11)  Displays an informational reminder if the patient is eligible only 
  for SC related appointments (<30% SC and above low income threshold).
  
  (12) Displays a Current-Year Income Test when calculating BT Travel
  Benefits and when entering a Claim for a previous year. The information
  is automatically retrieved from the Annual Means Test file.
  
  (13) A new Fiscal report for vouchers can be printed or imported to an 
  Excel report.
  
  (14) Displays a new data item on the BT Claim Information Screen to 
  account for Public Transportation (bus pass, etc).
