CPRS GUI version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for
