   Remedy Overview:
   ================
   1) INC000000772743
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The CFO Office of Financial Oversight requested that Budget Object Code (BOC)
   2335 be added to NON-EXPENDABLE EQUIPMENT BUDGET OBJECT CODES (NX BOC)
   (#6914.4) file. 
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   This patch updates the NX BOC (#6914.4) file by adding code 2335.
   
   2) INC000000772753
   
   Problem:
   --------
   The CFO Office of Financial Oversight requested that General Ledger (GL)
   1524 be renamed to (GL) 1995 in the NON-EXPENDABLE STANDARD GENERAL 
   LEDGER (NX SGL)(#6914.3) file. 
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The NX SGL (#6914.3) file will be modified by this patch as follows:
   SGL 1524 (PROPERTY PENDING DISPOSAL) will be renamed to SGL 1995 (PP&E
   REMOVED FROM SERVICE BUT NOT DISPOSED)
  
   Note that the renaming of SGL 1524 to 1995 will automatically update all
   files and reports that print this data.  Also, the text for the Excessed
   Equipment Report [ENFAR7] option has been updated accordingly. NO FAP
   Documents are required for this change, because a FA TYPE of 'X' 
   continues to be used for the Excess SGL account.
  
   Help text for the FAIR MARKET VALUE (#104) field of the FD DOCUMENT LOG
   File (#6915.5) is modified to display the correct SGL code.
