 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
  
 1. HD0000000066718
  
    Problem:
    --------
    User is receiving an <UNDEFINED> error when using the ENGINEERING
    EMPLOYEE FILE Menu Option [ENEMP] and the KEY DISTRIBUTION BY EMPLOYEE
    Menu Option [ENSPEDKEY] when entering a "^" and any other character at
    an edit prompt followed by a "^" at the next edit prompt.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines ENMAN and ENSP to protect variable DIC before the
    DIE,DIC calls.
  
 2. HD0000000536047
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Need to change Directive number on Hand Receipt text.  Currently
    showing "Directive 7125, Part 4, 5006". New Directive should read
    "Directive 7002, Part 2".
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified SIG^ENQCMR routine write line to reflect the correct Directive
    information.
  
 3. HD0000000218630
  
    Problem:
    --------
    CMR Field (#.19) triggers the population of the SERVICE POINTER field
    (#.21) of the EQUIPMENT INVENTORY FILE (#6914) file. It is not updating
    Service Pointer if CMR is changed only upon creation.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Corrected the trigger to the following: DELETE VALUE)=@
  
    Technical:
    ==========
    Pre-install routine - EN7P91 - deletes the old triggers in the fields
