Category: 
  - Input Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description: 
============

 This patch makes a Data Dictionary change and adds to an Input template.
 These changes work together with Incident Reporting patch QAN*2.0*29.
 This patch should be installed before QAN*2.0*29.
  
 A new field has been added to the QUALITY ASSURANCE SITE PARAMETER file
 (#740).  The field is QAN TIME REQUIRED (#755).  This field can be set to
 "Yes" if a site wants to require that the Incident date and time be
 entered rather than just date.
  
 A change has been made to the [QAQA QAN SITE PARAMETERS] input template to
 allow QAN TIME REQUIRED to be set in the option QA Site Parameters [QAN
 SITE PARAMETERS ENTER/EDIT].
  
 Please refer to the Patch Description for patch QAN*2.0*29 for a further
 description of these two patches.
  
 This patch can be loaded with users on the system. Installation should
 take less than 2 minutes.
