Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*359
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*435
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*10
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*271
  
 The four patches (PSO*7*359, IB*2*435, BPS*1*10, and PRCA*4.5*271) are 
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB PRCA BUNDLE 6.0.  For more specific
 instructions please refer to the installation steps provided in each of
 the patches.
  
 For the pharmacy claims that are processed electronically, the ePharmacy 
 module is currently compliant with the National Council for Prescription 
 Drug Programs (NCPDP) industry standards for version 5.1. NCPDP version 
 D.0 Level 1 compliance (completion of internal testing) must be in place 
 by January 1, 2011, and it must have completed external testing with 
 payers and be in production as of January 1, 2012. Meeting the deliverable
 dates is essential to VHA meeting this legislative mandate and for
 continued business with pharmacy payers. As part of these changes, VHA
 should also have backwards compatibility to the NCPDP version 5.1 to allow
 for continued revenue and processing of VHA pharmacy claims.
  
 The combined build will allow the processing and release of prescriptions 
 for patients with Insurance payers that use the new NCPDP version D.0 
 format for electronic claims processing as well as the current NCPDP
 version 5.1 format.
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. ECME was enhanced to send third party claims using the NCPDP
     Telecommunication Standard version D.0 specifications, which complies
     with new HIPAA requirements. Backwards compatibility with NCPDP
     Telecommunication Standard version 5.1 will be maintained until all
     third party payers are ready to support version D.0.
  
  2. ECME was enhanced to process Eligibility Verification requests, which
     will allow the sites to verify pharmacy insurance for patients. The
     process is initiated either through the new Eligibility Inquiry hidden
     (ELIG) action on the Further Research menu of the ECME User Screen
     [BPS USER SCREEN] or through a new IB option called Initiate
     e-Pharmacy Eligibility Inquiry [IBCNR ELIGIBILITY INQUIRY]. The
     results of the request will be displayed in the IB Insurance Buffer.
     Please see IB patch IB*2.0*435 for more detailed information on the
     new IB option and changes to the IB Insurance Buffer.
  
  3. A new hidden action - Eligibility Inquiry (ELIG) - was added to the
     Further Research Menu of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] to
     allow users to initiate Eligibility Verification requests for billing
     requests that are rejected. The user will be prompted for the
     Relationship Code, Person Code, and Effective Date, which will be
     included in the data of the Eligibility Verification Request.
  
  4. With NCPDP version D.0, the ECME number has increased in size from 7
     characters to 12 characters. To support this change, the following
     options were updated.
       a. ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN]
       b. Rejected Claims Report [BPS RPT REJECTION]
       c. Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE]
       d. Reversal Claims Report [BPS RPT REVERSAL]
       e. Claims Submitted, Not Yet Released [BPS RPT NOT RELEASED]
       f. Closed Claims Report [BPS RPT CLOSED CLAIMS]
       g. Recent Transactions [BPS RPT RECENT TRANSACTIONS]
       h. Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND
          TRICARE]
       i. Reopen Closed Claims action on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER
          SCREEN]
  
  5. The Claim Log (LOG) action on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN]
     was updated to display new NCPDP version D.0 fields that may be
     returned by the payer in a NCPDP version D.0 response.  It was also
     updated to synchronize the display more closely with the Reject
     Information screen of by the Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO
     REJECTS WORKLIST] and the Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process
     [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options.
  
  6. A new option Spending Account Report [BPS RPT SPENDING ACCOUNT] was
     added to the Claim Results and Status [BPS MENU RPT CLAIM STATUS] menu
     to display additional NCPDP version D.0 paid amount information that
     may be returned by the third party payer in a NCPDP version D.0
     response.
  
  7. The ECME Claims-Response Inquiry [BPS RPT CLAIMS RESPONSE] option was
     updated to display additional NCPDP version D.0 fields that are
     included in the outgoing request and the incoming payer response.
  
  8. The Payer Sheet Detail Report [BPS RPT PAYER SHEET DETAIL] was updated
     to include new NCPDP version D.0 segments and fields that are in
     version D.0 payer sheets. This report was also modified to remove the
     display of the Reversal Format, Reversal Sheet, Transaction Count and
     Certification ID headers and data in the header section of the report.
     These fields are plan specific and are no longer maintained with the
     payer sheets. To see this information, you should view the PLAN 
     information using the appropriate IB option.
  
  9. The Resubmit Claim w/EDITS (RED) action on the ECME User Screen [BPS
     USER SCREEN] was updated to prompt the user for the new NCPDP version
     D0 fields Patient Residence Code, Pharmacy Service Type Code, and
     Delay Reason Code.  In addition, this option was updated to allow the
     entry of up to three Submission Clarification codes.
  
  10. The BPS Edit Basic ECME Parameters [SETUP BASIC PARAMS] was modified
      to prompt for the Default Eligibility Pharmacy. This Pharmacy will be
      placed on the NCPDP Eligibility Verification request when it
      initiated by the new option in IB.
  
  11. The Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND
      TRICARE] option was modified to support the changes to the list of
      valid Paid Amount Qualifiers that occurred with the release of NCPDP
      version D.0. This is also true if a secondary claim is being
      processed through the Resubmit Claim w/EDITS (RED) action on the ECME
      User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN].
  
  12. The name of the View/Unstrand Claims Not Completed [BPS UNSTRAND
      SCREEN] option was changed to View/Unstrand Submissions Not Completed
      to reflect that it is also includes Eligibility Verification
      submissions. The screen was also modified to show each type of
      transaction (Billing Request, Reversal, and Eligibility Submissions)
      in their own section with a sub header at the beginning of each
      section.
  
  13. The Statistics Screen [BPS STATISTICS SCREEN] was modified to include
      two new categories - one for accepted Eligibility Verification
      request and the other for rejected Eligibility Verification
      requests.
  
  14. The ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] was updated to suppress the
      display of Eligibility Verification transmissions.
  
  15. All of the claims reports on the Claim Results and Status [BPS MENU
      RPT CLAIM STATUS] menu were updated to not display the results of
      Eligibility Verification requests.
  
  16. The Turn-around time statistics [BPS RPT TURNAROUND STATS] was
      modified to not display the results of Eligibility Verification 
      requests.
  
  17. The ECME bulletin, which is sent when ECME claims cannot be
      processed, was updated to include the site number in the Subject of 
      the mail message.
  
  18. The Insurer Asleep functionality used by the NCPDP claims
      submission process was updated to correct some existing
      deficiencies and to allow it to function with Eligibility
      verification submissions.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a pre-install routine associated with this patch named
 PRE^BPS10PRE. The purpose of the pre-install routine is to prepare
 several files for the reception of new NCPDP D.0 data.  The files
 affected are BPS CLAIMS (9002313.02), BPS RESPONSES (9002313.03), 
 BPS NCPDP RESULT OF SERVICE CODE (9002313.22), BPS NCPDP REASON FOR
 SERVICE CODE (9002313.23), BPS NCPDP DAW CODE (9002313.24), BPS
 NCPDP PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TYPE CODE (9002313.25), BPS NCPDP FIELD
 DEFS (9002313.91), and BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES (9002313.93). 
  
  
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 POST^BPS10PST. The purpose of the post-install routine is to:
   1. update the BPS REQUESTS (90023213.77), BPS INSURER DATA
      (9002313.78) and BPS LOG OF TRANSACTIONS (9002313.57) files
      in preparation for Eligibility Verification Requests.
   2. copy data in the BPS CLAIMS (90023213.02) and BPS RESPONSES
      (9002313.03) files to new structures in preparation for NCPDP
      D.0 claims.
   3. remove obsolete data and fields from the BPS CERTIFICATION
      (9002313.31) and BPS NCPDP FORMATS (9002313.92) files.
   4. set the VITRIA INTERFACE VERSION (6003) field of the BPS
      SETUP (900313.99) file to 4.  A registration message is also
      sent to the Financial Services Center (FSC) with this data.
      This allows the FSC to know that this patch has been installed.
   5. update the Read Access security to be 'Pp' for the BPS NCPDP 
      PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CODE (9002313.21), BPS NCPDP RESULT OF
      SERVICE CODE (9002313.22), BPS NCPDP REASON FOR SERVICE CODE
      (9002313.23), BPS NCPDP DAW CODE (9002313.24), BPS PAYER 
      RESPONSE OVERRIDES (9002313.32), BPS REQUESTS (90023213.77),
      and BPS INSURER DATA (9002313.78) files.  Changing this 
      security aligns these file with rest of the ECME files.
  
 Both of these routines are automatically deleted by KIDS if allowed by
 your local Kernel parameters configuration.  You may delete BPS10PRE
 and BPS10PST if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Do not queue the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to 
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both 
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission 
        options should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
 Install Time
 ------------
 The installation will take between 10 and 90 minutes depending upon how
 many entries your site has in the BPS CLAIMS file (9002313.02) and in the
 BPS RESPONSES file (9002313.03).  Data conversions will be run in both
 files and all entries will be checked during the installation of BPS*1*10.
  
  
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID, which contains the
     following patches:
  
         BPS*1.0*10
         PSO*7.0*359
         IB*2.0*435
         PRCA*4.5*271
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID host file is located in the 
      anonymous.software directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the
      file.
