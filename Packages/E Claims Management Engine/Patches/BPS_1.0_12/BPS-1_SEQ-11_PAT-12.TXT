Subject: GET REVERSAL PAYER SHEET FROM THE PHARMACY PLAN

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The transaction associated with an ePharmacy claim may not have the 
 current reversal payer sheet that should be used for a reversal claim.  To
 resolve this problem, this patch will retrieve the reversal payer sheet
 from the ePharmacy Plan associated with the ePharmacy claim.  On January 
 1, 2012, all ePharmacy claims must be submitted using National Council 
 for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) version D.0.  Installing this 
 update will ensure that reversal claims will be submitted in the D.0 
 format.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD0000000533767 - Retrieve the Reversal Payer Sheet from the Pharmacy
    Plan
    HD0000000536013 - Pharmacy transactions (Duplicate)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 If the payer changes payer sheet versions in between the initial claim
 request and the subsequent reversal request, there is currently no way
 to use the new version of the reversal payer sheet for that plan.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This coding fix would correct this problem by always using the payer
 sheet as specified in the ePharmacy plan.  ECME should retrieve the
 Reversal Payer Sheet from the ePharmacy PLAN file (#366.03) rather than
 from the BPS TRANSACTION file (#9002313.59).

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There are no pre or post-installation routines.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 The installation of this patch can be queued.  The installation will
 take less than 2 minutes.
  
 To avoid disruptions, this patch should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted
        to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP).  Wait for the
        CMOP transmissions to finish or complete the installation before
        the transmissions start. Both the CS (Controlled Substances) and
        the non-CS CMOP transmission options should be checked.  Check with
        Pharmacy Service or your Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP
        transmissions occur.
