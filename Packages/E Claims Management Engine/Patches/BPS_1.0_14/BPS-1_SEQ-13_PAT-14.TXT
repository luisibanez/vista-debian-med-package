 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD0000000367742 - <SUBSCRIPT>RESP1000+3^BPSOSQ4 ^BPS
  
 Problem:
 ========
 Throughout E-Pharmacy the Application Package Interface (API) to retrieve
 the HEADER RESPONSE STATUS (#501) field from the BPS RESPONSES
 (#9002313.03) file is called while passing in the POSITION IN CLAIM (#14)
 field from the BPS TRANSACTION (#9002313.59) file which is not a required
 field and in some cases is not defined, resulting in a <SUBSCRIPT> error.
    
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Instances where the POSITION IN CLAIM (#14) field of the BPS TRANSACTION 
 (#9002313.59) file, is not defined, will default to 1.
  
 Routine: BPSOSUC
  
  
 2) HD0000000313337 - Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE] issue
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 While running the Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE] menu option 
 the user should be able to enter either a CODE field (#.01) or
 CLASSIFICATION field (#1) values found in the VA DRUG CLASS (#50.65) for
 the Drug Class prompt; however only a CLASSIFICATION (#1) value is
 recognized as valid.
    
 Resolution:
 ===========
 While validating the user response, the validation code will check both
 the CODE (#.01) and CLASSIFICATION (#1) fields in the VA DRUG CLASS 
 (#50.65) file for matches or partial matches and accept both.
  
 Routine: BPSRPT3
  
  
 3) HD0000000337299 - Selected Default Division Disappears
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 When running the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] menu option, if the
 user chooses the "Sort List (SO)" option and saves that as the preferred
 view, the system will delete the "Division" choice from the selected view.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Currently when the user saves the view after sorting, it attempts to save
 a new "Division" value even though nothing was changed. Going forward, it
 will only save a "Division" value if it has been updated or modified.
