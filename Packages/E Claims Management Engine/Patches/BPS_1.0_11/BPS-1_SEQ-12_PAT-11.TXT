Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*385
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*452
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*11
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*73
  
 The patches (PSO*7*385, IB*2*452, BPS*1*11, and PSX*2*73) are being released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB PSX BUNDLE 7.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates and to address and correct gaps and 
 inefficiencies in the current electronic pharmacy billing processes.  This 
 will ultimately increase revenues collected by VA Medical Centers and 
 outpatient pharmacies by reducing the volume of short pays and payment 
 denials.
  
 All pharmacy claims for payers that are processed electronically are 
 compliant with the current industry standards.  This software adds support 
 for the electronic billing of the Health Administration Center (HAC) CHAMPVA 
 payer in order to provide an automated process and to prevent manual 
 workarounds for CHAMPVA.
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. A new reject code "eC" has been added to the BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES
     file (#9002313.93).  The associated description for this new code
     is CHAMPVA-DRUG NON BILLABLE.
  
  2. A new mailgroup for CHAMPVA claims has been created with this patch.
     When ECME has problems in processing a CHAMPVA claim, a message will
     be sent to this mailgroup.  Members can be added to the mail group by
     using the Mail Group Edit [XMEDITMG] option.
  
  3. The Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE], Reversal Claims Report
     [BPS RPT REVERSAL], and Closed Claims Report [BPS RPT CLOSED CLAIMS] 
     have been modified to include the patient eligibility (VETERAN, 
     TRICARE, or CHAMPVA).  The report display and the Excel output version
     now contain a column header and data for eligibility.  A new filter
     has been added to these reports that allows the user to select a 
     specific patient eligibility or ALL.  In addition, the location of the
     eligibility column on both the screen display and Excel output of the
     Rejected Claims Report [BPS RPT REJECTION] was moved to match the 
     other reports.
  
  4. For CHAMPVA eligible patient, the ECME User Screen displays CVA 
     eligibility as part of the patient/insurance line.
  
  5. The Change View action of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] 
     allows the user to select NCPDP submissions with a CHAMPVA patient
     eligibility.
  
  6. The Change View action of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] 
     allows the user to select NCPDP submissions with an UNSTRANDED 
     status.
  
  7. When a claim rejection has been ignored by using the IGN action on the
     Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] or via the
     Reject Notification Screen, the comment entered during the ignore 
     process will be displayed in the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] 
     prefaced by the word "IGNORED".
  
  8. When using the Resubmit with Edits (RED) action on the ECME User 
     Screen [BPS USER SCREEN], the user will now be allowed to edit the 
     Date of Service field on an ECME claim if the prescription is 
     released.  Additionally, the Relationship Code prompt was changed to
     Pharmacy Relationship Code that the Person Code prompt was changed 
     to Pharmacy Person Code.  Also, the list of submission clarification
     codes that can be selected has been updated to reflect new values in
     the NCPDP standard.
     
  9. A new report called View ePharmacy Rx is now available from multiple
     locations in ECME and Outpatient Pharmacy.  This new report combines 
     data from multiple screens and reports in Outpatient Pharmacy, ECME, 
     and Integrated Billing.  The combined data is presented in a single 
     List Manager screen.  In ECME, this report is available via the View 
     ePharmacy Rx [BPS RPT VIEW ECME RX] option on the Other Reports [BPS 
     MENU RPT OTHER] menu.
  
 10. The LOG action - Print Claim Log - of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER
     SCREEN] has been enhanced as follows:
       a. NCPDP quantity and units are displayed if they exist and Billed
          quantity and units are displayed.
       b. All of the fees, costs and amounts sent on an ECME claim are now
          displayed with the proper field labels.
       c. Extraneous whitespace has been removed.
  
 11. The ePharmacy Date of Service calculation algorithm has been modified 
     with this patch.  The fill date is no longer considered an acceptable
     value for the date of service.  The algorithm uses the release date if
     it exists.  If the release date doesn't exist, then the system uses
     the current date.
  
 12. References in the ECME system to Fill Date have been changed to be 
     Date of Service to more accurately indicate the data being displayed.
  
 13. The ECME system now has the ability to remove outbound messages from 
     the HL7 queue if the user unstrands a claim using the option 
     View/Unstrand Submissions Not Completed [BPS UNSTRAND SCREEN].
  
 14. When an NCPDP response with a DUPLICATE status is received, the ECME
     system will now process that response as a normal payable response in
     order to create bills in IB and AR if a bill does not yet exist.  The
     IB system will make that determination.
  
 15. The ECME system will now use the indicator "P2" to indicate that the 
     ECME claim was initiated by the PRO option - Process Secondary/TRICARE
     Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND TRICARE].  The user will also be 
     able to filter results on the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] and
     on the ECME Claims Reports by RT - Real Time Fills, BB - Backbilling,
     or P2 - PRO option.
  
 16. The ECME system receives all appropriate fees and costs from the
     Integrated Billing system and uses them in the correct NCPDP fields
     on the claim.  These include:
       a. Dispensing Fee (412-DC)
       b. Basis of Cost Determination (423-DN)
       c. Gross Amount Due (430-DU)
       d. Administrative Fee (480-H9)
       e. Ingredient Cost (409-D9)
       f. Usual and Customary Charge (426-DQ)
  
 17. Several ECME reports have been updated to display the above fees and
     costs when using the Excel output versions of the report data.
  
 18. The Process Secondary/TRICARE Rx to ECME [BPS COB PROCESS SECOND
     TRICARE] option was modified to correctly handle the previous
     payment when the primary claim was paper. 
  
 19. A bulletin is created whenever a primary claim is closed in ECME 
     and there is an open secondary claim.  This scenario can occur when
     and inpatient claim is auto-reversed by the ECME Nightly Background
     Job or if the prescription is returned to stock or the prescription
     is deleted.
  
 20. When the ECME Nightly Background Job does an inpatient auto-reversal,
     the reason not billable is set to 'INPATIENT RX AUTO-REVERSAL', which
     is a new non-billable reason created in Integrated Billing.
     Previously, the non-billable reason of 'OTHER' was used.
  
 21. The Payable Claims Report [BPS RPT PAYABLE], Rejected Claims Report 
     [BPS RPT REJECTION], Claims Submitted, Not Yet Released Report [BPS
     RPT NOT RELEASED], and Spending Account Report [BPS RPT SPENDING
     ACCOUNT] have been corrected to display the correct amount in the
     $BILLED column.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named
 POST^BPS10P11. The purpose of the post install routine is to:
  
   a. Create a new entry called 'CHAMPVA DRUG NON BILLABLE' in the BPS
      NCPDP REJECT CODES (#9002313.93) dictionary.
   b. Update several pricing fields in the BPS NCPDP FIELD DEFS
      (#9002313.92) file so that the NCPDP claims will have the new data
      returned by IB Billing Determination.
   c. Remove the DATE OF SERVICE (#401) field from the TRANSACTION
      multiple (#400) of the BPS CLAIMS (#9002313.02) file.
   d. Remove the obsolete SUBMISSION CLARIFICATION CODE (#420) field from
      the TRANSACTION multiple (#400) of the BPS CLAIMS (#9002313.02) file.
   e. Validate that the PATIENT RELATIONSHIP CODE (#1.05) field of the
      BPS INSURER DATA (#9002313.78) file has the correct range of data
      (0-4) and correct it if it does not.
   f. Remove cached hidden menu pointers allowing modified protocols to
      display correctly.
   g. When appropriate, swap the data in the DUR REASON CODE (#.01) and
      DUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE CODE (#.02) fields of the DUR (#9002313.771)
      multiple of the BPS REQUESTS (#9002313.77) file.
   h. Change the Read Security of the BPS NCPDP FIELD CODES (#9002313.94)
      file to "Pp", which matches the rest of the ECME files.
   i. Add two new NCPDP reject codes to the BPS NCPDP REJECT CODES
      (#9002313.93) dictionary.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if
 allowed by your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 routine BPS10P11 if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take up to 20 minutes to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
               ***** IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES *****
  
 This patch bundle is changing the name of File #52.87.  The current name of
 this file is 'PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG'.  The new name of this file is 'PSO AUDIT
 LOG'.  During the patch installation you will see the following information
