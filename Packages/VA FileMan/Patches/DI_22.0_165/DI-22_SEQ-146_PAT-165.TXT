                           ** Notice: **
 ** See "Installation Instructions" section for Installation Warning **
   
 This patch addresses the following items:
  
 1. Remedy Tickets 354944,483379,495322:
 FIND^DIC erroneously uses an errant extant DIC("S") if the file being
 searched has node 7.5 of the .01 field defined in the DD
 (^DD(file#,.01,7.5)). (Files which have been standardized have this node
 set.) This is a problem because all inputs to FIND^DIC are supposed to be
 via its parameters, and not via setting extraneous local variables.
 Note: This problem is solved by "new"ing DIC within the API. This will protect
 against other pre-existing DIC variables too, such as DIC(0).
 (Routine ^DICF,^DICF4)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 Select a file which has been standardized. Let's choose the VA PRODUCT
 (#50.68) file. It has a node 7.5 on its .01 field:
  
 ^DD(50.68,.01,7.5)=I $G(DIC(0))["L",'$D(XUMF) K X D EN^DDIOL("Entries Must
 be edited via the Master File Server (MFS).","","!?5,$C(7)")
  
 Let's do a lookup.
 >D FIND^DIC(50.68,,,,"ACAI",,,,,"MYLIST")
  
 >ZW MYLIST
 MYLIST("DILIST",0)="2^*^0^"
 MYLIST("DILIST",1,1)="ACAI CAP/TAB"
 MYLIST("DILIST",1,2)="ACAI LIQUID,ORAL"
 MYLIST("DILIST",2,1)=20716
 MYLIST("DILIST",2,2)=21041
  
 Clear the local variables, perhaps using P^DI. Set DIC("S"), which is not
 a valid input variable to the FIND^DIC API. Redo the lookup.
 >S DIC("S")="W !,""Alice lives here."""
  
 >D FIND^DIC(50.68,,,,"ACAI",,,,,"MYLIST")
  
 Alice lives here.
 Alice lives here.
 >ZW MYLIST
 MYLIST("DILIST",0)="2^*^0^"
 MYLIST("DILIST",1,1)="ACAI CAP/TAB"
 MYLIST("DILIST",1,2)="ACAI LIQUID,ORAL"
 MYLIST("DILIST",2,1)=20716
 MYLIST("DILIST",2,2)=21041
 Not good! It's executing the errant DIC("S").
  
 Now let's make it worse. Let's make DIC("S") screen out the results.
 >S DIC("S")="W !,""Alice lives here."" I 0"         
  
 >D FIND^DIC(50.68,,,,"ACAI",,,,,"MYLIST")
  
 Alice lives here.
 Alice lives here.
 >ZW MYLIST
 MYLIST("DILIST",0)="0^*^0^"
 Yikes! That's bad. That screen has affected our results.
  
 Repeat the above test after the patch is installed and you'll find that
 Alice doesn't live here anymore. FIND^DIC will ignore the errant DIC("S").
  
 2. Remedy Ticket 409387:
 It is possible to have 2 different fields in the same file with traditional
 cross references of the same name. This is not good.
 (Routine ^DICE)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 Create a traditional cross reference on a field in some test file you've
 got hanging around. (It doesn't matter whether the cross reference is for
 both lookup and sorting, or just lookup.) Now create a traditional xref of
 the same name on another field in the same file. You've got two cross
 references with the same name! Not good.
  
 After the patch is installed, you won't be able to do it. Make sure you
 delete the cross references you created.
  
 3. Remedy Ticket 417451:
 Any 2-digit time that's zero + 1 digit before 06 is interpreted as p.m.;
 06 and after is interpreted as a.m. This is not correct. All times that
 start with zero should be interpreted as a.m. For example: T@06 is correctly
 interpreted as 6 a.m. but T@04 is wrongly interpreted as 4 p.m.
 (Routine ^DIDT, aka ^%DT)
  
 Let's test it out. This is what we see before the patch:
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@4  (JUL 28, 2010@16:00)    <- The time has 1 digit, and it's
 before 6, so FM makes an assumption of 4 p.m. That's fine here, because the
 user could mean either morning or afternoon.
  
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@04  (JUL 28, 2010@16:00)   <- The time has 2 digits, and it's
 before 06, so FM again makes an assumption of 4 p.m. That's wrong here,
 because there's no question the user means morning.
  
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@0400  (JUL 28, 2010@04:00) <- FM gets it right if the time has
 4 digits.
  
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@05  (JUL 28, 2010@17:00)   <- FM gets 05 wrong, too.
  
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@06  (JUL 28, 2010@06:00)   <- FM gets 06 right.
  
 >S %DT="AET" D ^%DT
 DATE: T+1@07  (JUL 28, 2010@07:00)   <- FM gets 07 right.
  
 Repeat the above test after the patch is installed, and you'll find that
 all 2-digit times beginning with zero should be interpreted as a.m.
  
 4. Remedy Ticket 425109:
 When FileMan subtotals two entries with similar (1st 25 characters are the
 same) names, it may assign all the counts to the entry with the shorter
 name, and it drops the entry with the longer name.
  
 To correct this, we're editing the MUMPS OPERATING SYSTEM (#.7) file. We're
 changing the GLOBAL LENGTH (MAX) (#2) field from 120 to 250. While we're
 there, we'll also take the opportunity to change the ROUTINE SIZE (MAX) (#3)
 field from 8000 to 15000, and the INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIPT LENGTH (#7) field
 from 63 to 250.
 (Routines ^DIPR165, ^DINIT21)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed, do the following print:

 ...
  
 You'll get lots of clinics. Pick two, and change their names in the
 HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file:
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: PATIENT// 44  HOSPITAL LOCATION  (1552 entries)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// .01  NAME
 THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
 Select HOSPITAL LOCATION NAME: 240 MINUTES

 Select HOSPITAL LOCATION NAME: CHAPLAIN
      1   CHAPLAIN       
      2   CHAPLAIN GROUP       
 CHOOSE 1-2: 1  CHAPLAIN     
 NAME: CHAPLAIN// MY NEW CLINIC NAME IS FUNNER
  
 Now run that print again. Verify that only the MY NEW CLINIC NAME IS FUN
 clinic appears in the report, and that it may have the counts of both
 clinics.
                  CLINIC: MY NEW CLINIC NAME IS FUN
 SUBCOUNT  3
  
 After the patch is installed, both clinics should appear in the report.
 Don't forget to restore the names of the clinics!
  
 5. Remedy Tickets 429694, 430874, 433940, 435273, 435986, 438326, 441772:
 When doing a ^DIC lookup, and DIC(0) contains the "T" parameter, VA FileMan
 aborts if X (the item being looked up) contains more than 40 characters.
 This is now fixed.
 (Routines ^DIC1, ^DIC3, ^DICM)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 >S X=<a string longer than 40 characters>
 >K DIC S DIC(0)="EMT",DIC=50 D ^DIC
  
 <UNDEFINED>EXACT+3^DIC3 *DICR(2,"ORG")
  
 After the patch is installed, you won't see this error.
  
 6. Remedy Ticket 441529:
  
 If a field is being audited, and it has an audit condition, if you delete
 the audit condition, the auditing will fail for deletions, although it
 continues to work for additions. This problem was introduced in patch
 DI*22*160.
 (Routine ^DIK1)
  
 7. Remedy Ticket 480112:
  
 The VA FileMan Browser does not work if the Terminal Emulator being used
 causes variables IOSTBM and IOIL to be defined on Kernel sign-in, and IORI
 is not defined.
 (Routine ^DDBR)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 FMD>S X="IOSTBM;IOIL" D ENDR^%ZISS
  
 FMD>W $D(IOSTBM)
 1
 FMD>W $D(IOIL)
 1
 FMD>W $D(IORI)

 FMD>D BROWSE^DDBR("^TMP(""EXAMPLE"",$J)","N","Example")
 << Nothing is displayed >>
  
 FMD>D ^%G
  
 Device: 
 Right margin: 80 => 
 Screen size for paging (0=nopaging)? 24 =>

 Global ^TMP("DIERR",$J -- NOTE: translation in effect
 ^TMP("DIERR",543906203,1)=842
 ^TMP("DIERR",543906203,1,"TEXT",1)="Reverse index cannot be found for
                                     Terminal Type C-VT320."
 ^TMP("DIERR",543906203,"E",842,1)=""
  
 However, we see that reverse index is indeed defined for this terminal type:
  
 Global ^%ZIS(2,242,0) -- NOTE: translation in effect
 ^%ZIS(2,242,0)="C-VT320^1"
  
 Global ^%ZIS(2,242,14) -- NOTE: translation in effect
 ^%ZIS(2,242,14)="$C(27)_""D""^$C(27)_""M""^$C(27,55)^$C(27,56)^$C(27)_""E"""
  
 After the patch is installed, the Browser will work.
  
 8. Remedy Ticket 449884:
  
 The API C^%DTC, which adds a given number of days to a date and returns the
 resulting date, can return an invalid date if the number of days contains a
 fraction.
 (Routine ^DIDTC)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 FMD>S MYDT=3101231
 FMD>F I=.1:.1:1 S X1=MYDT,X2=I D C^%DTC W !,X," +",I
  
 3101231 +.1
 3101231 +.2
 3101231 +.3
 3101301 +.4  <<
 3101301 +.5  <<
 3110101 +.6
 3110101 +.7
 3110101 +.8
 3110101 +.9
 3110101 +1
 You can see that when .4 or .5 is added to 12/31/2010, the API invents a
 new month: 13/01/2010.
  
 After the patch is installed, the API will settle down to its boring old
 self.
  
 9. Remedy Ticket 485258:
  
 If a field is more than 100 characters, and a new-style cross-reference on
 that field has a maximum length more than 100 characters, the API
 $$FIND1^DIC can fail if the item being looked up is more than 30 characters.
 (Routine ^DICUIX)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
 Create a test file with just the .01 field.
 Make it free text with more than 100 characters.
 Once you've done that, delete the B cross-reference and create a new-style
 B cross reference with a maximum length more than 100 characters.
  
 Your file might look like this:
 16082,.01     NAME                   0;1 FREE TEXT (Required)
  
               INPUT TRANSFORM:  K:$L(X)>225!($L(X)<3)!'(X'?1P.E) X
               LAST EDITED:      APR 19, 2011 
               HELP-PROMPT:      Answer must be 3-225 characters in length. 
               FIELD INDEX:      B (#292)    REGULAR    IR    LOOKUP & SORTING
                   Short Descr:  LOOKUP AND SORTING
                   Description:  LOOKUP AND SORTING 
                     Set Logic:  S ^DIZ(16082,"B",$E(X,1,225),DA)=""
                    Kill Logic:  K ^DIZ(16082,"B",$E(X,1,225),DA)
                    Whole Kill:  K ^DIZ(16082,"B")
                          X(1):  NAME  (16082,.01)  (Subscr 1)  (Len 225)
                                 (forwards)
  
 Now edit the file to add a record to it.
 Make the NAME "Office of Quality & Performance". That's 31 characters.
  
 Now let's do a couple of lookups:
 FMD>S X="Office of Quality & Performance"
 FMD>W $$FIND1^DIC(16082,,,X)
 1 << found it
 FMD>W $$FIND1^DIC(16082,,"BX",X)
 0 << didn't find it.
  
 If you change the length of the B cross-reference from 225 to 100
 characters, both lookups will work.
  
 After the patch is installed, the lookups will work regardless of the
 length of the B cross-reference.
  
  
 10. Remedy Ticket 487174:
  
 The LIST^DIC API aborts when asked to retrieve computed fields within a
 multiple.
 (Routine ^DICU2)
  
 Here's how we test it. Before the patch is installed:
  
 Pick a file with a multiple which has a computed field. The HOSPITAL LOCATION
 (#44) file will do. The AVAILABILITY (#44.002) subfile contains the DAY OF
 WEEK (#3) field, which is computed. The API requires an IENS (the second
 parameter) when a subfile is involved, so we'll use record 16.
  
 >D LIST^DIC(44.002,",16,",3)
  
 S Y(44.002,3,1)=$S($D(^SC(D0,"T",D1,0)):^(0),1:"") S X=$P(Y(44.002,3,1),U,1)
 D DW^%DTC S X=X
 <UNDEFINED>I4+9^DICU2 *D1
  
 After the patch is installed the API will give you the day of the week -
 you'll see it in ^TMP("DILIST",$J
 (But the API still won't give you the time of day!)

 Please see the "Routine Information" section. 
 *Note: Routine: DIPR165 issues a warning during the installation of 
 this patch if it appears that TaskMan is still running and/or logons 
 have not been inhibited.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 ** Although queuing of this patch is allowed, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 that ALL Users be off the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED
 before this patch is installed. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in
 a wait state. Failure to do so may result in 'source routine edited'
 errors during a database update. Edits may be lost and records may be
 left in an inconsistent state. An error that occurs before a cross-
 reference is executed, for example, may lead to corrupted data or hard
 errors in the future. **
  
 Also, please make sure that no other patches are installed until
 Installation for this patch has completed.
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise 
 that the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than a minute.
  
      1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
 This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
      2.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
 system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
      3.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following options:
  
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
  
      4.  In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
 installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and 
 ALL non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site 
 specific procedures. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait state.
 All users should be off the system. NOT performing this step could result
 in 'source routine edited' error during database updates, and records may
 be left in an inconsistent state.
  
      5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following option:
  
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*165
                                 ===========
  
 The Environment Check Routine DIPR165 runs automatically during this
 step. DIPR165 issues a warning if it appears that TaskMan is still 
 running or logons have not been inhibited. You will also see:
