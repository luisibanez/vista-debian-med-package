 This patch addresses the following item:
  
 1.     Remedy Ticket 447336:
 There are files which shouldn't be re-indexed. When they are inadvertently
 re-indexed, it unleashes a zombie apocalypse, and necessitates restores
 from backup. A recent example is the unfortunate re-indexing of the
 HOSPITAL LOCATION (#44) file, as described in Remedy Ticket 445925.
 Currently there is no way to prevent such files from being re-indexed,
 except for putting "DO NOT RE-INDEX" in the file description, which is
 about as effective as the admonition that Zeus gave Pandora not to open
 that box. The RE-INDEX FILE [DIRDEX] option is a powerful, useful tool,
 like a buzz-saw. But like a buzz-saw, it can cause a lot of damage when
 one isn't paying attention.
 
 This patch introduces a solution to this problem. Individual cross-
 references may now be marked "Do Not Re-Index", and the RE-INDEX FILE
 [DIRDEX] option will respect that. APIs which perform re-indexing will
 also respect that, with the following exceptions:
   1) APIs which re-index a single record will ignore the no-re-index
      restriction.
   2) A cross-reference will be re-indexed if it is specifically named
      in an API call, regardless of whether it is marked "Do Not Re-Index".
 
 Traditional Regular cross-references, such as B and C cross-references,
 may always be re-indexed, and cannot be marked "Do Not Re-Index". All
 other cross-references may be marked "Do Not Re-Index", because re-indexing
 them might cause problems. The following cross-reference types may be
 marked "Do Not Re-Index":
   1) All New-Style cross-references
   2) Bulletin cross-references
   3) MUMPS cross-references
   4) Trigger cross-references
 
 To mark a cross-reference "Do Not Re-Index", use the CROSS-REFERENCE A
 FIELD OR FILE [DIXREF] option under the UTILITY FUNCTIONS [DIUTILITY]
 option. New-Style cross-references may be marked "Do Not Re-Index" when
 they are created or when edited later. Traditional Bulletin, MUMPS, and
 Trigger cross-references may not be marked "Do Not Re-Index" when they
 are created; only when edited later. "Do Not Re-Index" can only be undone
 by killing the "NOREINDEX" node in the DD.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The following fields are added to facilitate "Do Not Re-Index":
 1)     RE-INDEXING (#666) field in the CROSS-REFERENCE (#.1) file.
 Note that this file is not viewable through FileMan. If you want to see
 this new field, do a global listing on ^DD(.1,666
 2)     RE-INDEXING (#666) field in the INDEX (#.11) file:
 .11,666     RE-INDEXING            NOREINDEX;1 SET
                             '1' FOR NO RE-INDEXING ALLOWED; 
                             '0' FOR ALLOW REINDEXING; 
             HELP-PROMPT:    Should the re-indexing of this cross reference 
                             be prohibited? 
             DESCRIPTION:    If you answer '1', this cross reference will
                             not be re-indexed during a general re-indexing
                             of this file, whether it's done via API or 
                             interactively. If you answer '0', which is the
                             default, it will. A cross reference will be
                             re-indexed if it is specifically named in an
                             API call.  For those APIs which re-index a
                             single record, this restriction is ignored.
                             UNEDITABLE
 
 Additionally, the following field is added to the 'DIKC EDIT MAIN' Block
 record of the BLOCK (#.404) file. This block is used in the 'DIKC EDIT'
 ScreenMan Form record of the FORM (#.403) file:
 FIELD ORDER: 666                        CAPTION: Do Not ReIndex
   FIELD TYPE: DATA DICTIONARY FIELD     FIELD: 666
   DATA COORDINATE: 14,26                DATA LENGTH: 22
   CAPTION COORDINATE: 14,10
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 This is how the re-indexing APIs behave relative to "Do Not Re-Index":
   1) Ignore "Do Not Re-Index", because they operate on a single record:
      a. EN^DIK
      b. EN1^DIK
      c. EN2^DIK
      d. IX^DIK
      e. IX1^DIK
      f. IX2^DIK
   2) Ignore "Do Not Re-Index", if the cross-reference IS specifically named:
      a. ENALL^DIK
      b. ENALL2^DIK
   3) Honor "Do Not Re-Index":
      a. ENALL^DIK      (If the cross-reference is NOT specifically named)
      b. ENALL2^DIK     (If the cross-reference is NOT specifically named)
      c. IXALL^DIK
      d. IXALL2^DIK

 Routine Summary: 
 ================
 Please see the "Routine Information" section. 
 *Note: Routine: DIPR167 issues a warning during the installation of 
 this patch if it appears that TaskMan is still running and/or logons 
 have not been inhibited.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 ** DON'T QUEUE THIS PATCH. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that ALL Users be off
 the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED before this patch is
 installed. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait state. Failure
 to do so may result in 'source routine edited' errors during a database
 update. Edits may be lost and records may be left in an inconsistent
 state. An error that occurs before a cross-reference is executed, for
 example, may lead to corrupted data or hard errors in the future. **
  
 Also, please make sure that no other patches are installed until
 installation for this patch has completed.
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise 
 that the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than a minute.
  
      1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
 This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
      2.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
 system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
      3.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following options:
  
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
  
      4.  In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
 installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and 
 ALL non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site 
 specific procedures. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait state.
 All users should be off the system. NOT performing this step could result
 in 'source routine edited' error during database updates, and records may
 be left in an inconsistent state.
  
      5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following option:
  
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*167
                                 ===========
  
 The Environment Check Routine DIPR167 runs automatically during this
 step. DIPR167 issues a warning if it appears that TaskMan is still 
 running or logons have not been inhibited.
  
            Answer 'YES' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
 install?'
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
 Options, and Protocols?'
  
      6.  Don't yet Re-enable all processes stopped in step 4 above.
 Follow the Post Installation instructions first!
  
 Post Installation
 =================
 Upon successful installation of this patch, routine DIPR167 will be deleted.
 
      1.  VERY IMPORTANT:
 You must now enter "D ^DINIT" from the programmer prompt. KIDS by design
 does not transport the FileMan files which we are changing with this patch.
 The only way to implement the changes is by running ^DINIT like this:
 
 > D ^DINIT
 Answer YES to the following prompt:
 Initialize VA FileMan now?  NO//YES
 
 Accept the default answers to the following prompts:
 SITE NAME:
 SITE NUMBER:
 Do you want to change the MUMPS OPERATING SYSTEM File? NO//
 TYPE OF MUMPS SYSTEM YOU ARE USING:
 
 If any of the default answers is missing or wrong, and you are unsure of
 the correct answer, please file a Remedy ticket.
 
      2.  Now Re-enable all processes stopped in Step 4 of the Installation
 instructions above.
