Description:
============

                           ** Notice: **
 ** See "Installation Instructions" section for Installation Warning **
   
 We had such a great time at the last Bug Stomp Jamboree, that we decided
 to invite you all to come on down and party again. Oh boy, we're already
 planning the next one!
  
 This patch addresses the following items:
  
 1. Remedy Ticket 67942
 If you use a partial order number to inquire into the ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
 (#102.4) file, you will be greeted with a lot of dots and a very long wait.
 (The .01 field of this file points to the ORDER (#100) file, which does not
 have a B cross-reference.) This patch eliminates that wait.
 (Routine ^DICM)
  
 Observe:
  
 Select OPTION: INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES  
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: MAILBOX// 102.4  ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
                                           (25 entries)
 Select ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: ?
  Answer with ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
  Do you want the entire 25-Entry ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT List? Y  (Yes)
    Choose from:
    3691609   
    3691615   
    3691616   
    3691617   
    3691618
     <snip>
 Select ORDER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: 369..........................................
 ...........................................................................
 <snip>
  
 With the patch, VA FileMan will respond with "??" to a partial order number,
 because complete order numbers must be used in this situation.
  
 2. Remedy Ticket 466389, 713657
 If you use the re-indexing API ENALL2^DIK on a file with no entries,
 VA FileMan will abort. This patch prevents that from happening.
 (Routine ^DIK1)
  
 Observe:

 3. Remedy Ticket 586657
 If you use the EDIT FILE [DIEDFILE] option under the UTILITY FUNCTIONS
 [DIUTILITY] option, and enter "??" at the "Select APPLICATION GROUP:"
 prompt, you get different errors depending on the circumstances.
 This patch prevents the errors.

 VA FileMan simply aborts if there's nothing here yet. Double oops!
  
 4. Remedy Ticket 590010
 The API DELIXN^DDMOD does not give you an error (or error message) if you
 pass it a non-existent cross-reference to delete, even though it should.
 Also, if you call it with a null first argument, it aborts. This patch
 ensures that you get a proper error message under the circumstances
 described.
 (Routine ^DIKD2)
  
 Observe:
 Call with invalid cross-reference name:

 > ZW DIERR
  
 > D ^%G
  
 Device:
 Right margin: 80 =>

 5. Remedy Ticket 593847
 When printing (or creating/editing a print template) VA FileMan doesn't
 notice an error in a $SELECT statement, namely using a comma where a
 colon is called for. This patch catches that error.
 (Routine ^DICOMPW)
  
 Observe:
 Select OPTION: PRINT FILE ENTRIES  
  
 OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS// 699  ENDOSCOPY/CONSULT
                                           (1 entry)

   THEN PRINT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUB-FIELD: $S($L(SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS)>0,"SIGNS
 AND SYMPTOMS:",1:"")
   THEN PRINT SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SUB-FIELD:
 The first comma should be a colon in the above $S.
  
 6. Remedy Ticket 614058
 Patch DI*22*152 added the "|" character to the list of optional characters
 to use in the DIWF input variable of the API ^DIWP, but it was never
 documented, and it didn't work. The "|" character means that any "|" in
 the text should be printed as-is, but word-wrap should still function, and
 margins respected. This patch makes the "|" character in DIWF function as
 intended, and includes it in the documentation.
 (Routine ^DIWP)
  
 Observe:
 >K ^UTILITY($J)                                  
 >S X="Testing a line with the | character in it."
 >S DIWL=5,DIWR=30,DIWF="|" D ^DIWP               
 >ZW ^UTILITY($J)                                 
 ^UTILITY(544756092,"W",5)=2
 ^UTILITY(544756092,"W",5,1,0)="Testing a line with the |"
 ^UTILITY(544756092,"W",5,2,0)="character in it.| "
 Note that the API put a trailing "|" at the end of the text.
 It shouldn't have.
  
 7. Remedy Ticket 622106, 624208
 The API ^DIM incorrectly validates some M code. This patch corrects that.
 (Routine ^DIM2)
  
 Observe:
 >S X="S Y=AGE&FI(1)'FI(2)"
 >D ^DIM
 >ZW X
 X="S Y=AGE&FI(1)'FI(2)"
 It should have killed X, since the M code in X is not valid.
  
 8. Remedy Ticket 726162
 This one is SO EMBARASSING! If you edit a .01 field and enter text
 containing an embedded "^", VA FileMan sets the .01 field with the first
 "^" piece, and the next field with the second "^" piece! This patch
 prevents that from happening.
 (Routine ^DICN)
  
 Observe:
 Here's a test file:

 Patch DI*22*165 made a change to the APIs FIND^DIC and $$FIND1^DIC to
 prevent looking up in the pointed-to file when the lookup value is a
 number, the pointer index is not the "B" index, and the "M" flag is
 passed. This was to avoid the possible confusion of having a large
 number of matches returned. However, the change caused some existing
 lookups to break. This patch restores the lookup capability.
 (Routine ^DICF4)
  
 Observe:
 The HL LOGICAL LINK (#870) file has a "C" index on the INSTITUTION (#.02)
 field [node 0, piece 2], which is a pointer to the INSTITUTION (#4) file.
 Here is a test entry:
  
 Global ^HLCS(870,235
 ^HLCS(870,235,0)="VAVCB^7^...
             ...
  
 Global ^HLCS(870,"C",7
 ^HLCS(870,"C",7,235)=""
  
 The INSTITUTION (#4) file has a "D" index on the STATION NUMBER (#99) field
 [node 99, piece 1]:
  
 Global ^DIC(4,7
 ^DIC(4,7,0)="TEXAS VALLEY COASTAL BEND HCS^48"
         99)=740
  
 Global ^DIC(4,"D",740
 ^DIC(4,"D",740,7)=""
  
 If we do a FIND^DIC or $$FIND1^DIC call to look up station number 740 on
 File #870 and use the "M" flag to use multiple indexes, the APIs should
 return entry #235, since its "C" index points to an entry in the
 INSTITUTION file that has 740 in its "D" index. However, they return no
 matches:
  
 >D FIND^DIC(870,"","","PM",740,"","","","","TARG","MSG")
  
 >ZW TARG
 TARG("DILIST",0)="0^*^0^"
 TARG("DILIST",0,"MAP")="IEN^.01I"
  
 >W $$FIND1^DIC(870,,"M","740")
 0
  
 After the patch, FIND^DIC and $$FIND1^DIC correctly find the entry:
  
 >D FIND^DIC(870,"","","PM",740,"","","","","TARG","MSG")
  
 >ZW TARG
 TARG("DILIST",0)="1^*^0^"
 TARG("DILIST",0,"MAP")="IEN^.01I"
 TARG("DILIST",1,0)="235^VAVCB"
  
 >W $$FIND1^DIC(870,,"M","740")
 235

 This patch adds a new key sequence <PF1><PF1>P to the Browser to allow printing
 the current document. When <PF1><PF1>P is pressed, the user is asked whether to
 print a header on each page, and whether to wrap text on word boundaries and
 interpret word processing (|) windows. The user is then asked to select a
 printer device.

 Routine Summary: 
 ================
 Please see the "Routine Information" section. 
 *Note: Routine: DIPR169 issues a warning during the installation of 
 this patch if it appears that TaskMan is still running and/or logons 
 have not been inhibited.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 =========================
 ** Although queuing of this patch is allowed, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
 that ALL Users be off the system and VISTA Background jobs be STOPPED
 before this patch is installed. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in
 a wait state. Failure to do so may result in 'source routine edited'
 errors during a database update. Edits may be lost and records may be
 left in an inconsistent state. An error that occurs before a cross-
 reference is executed, for example, may lead to corrupted data or hard
 errors in the future. **
  
 Also, please make sure that no other patches are installed until
 installation for this patch has completed.
  
 The following installation instructions are based upon the premise 
 that the installer has heeded the above warning.
  
 Installation should take less than a minute.
  
      1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. 
 This option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
      2.  The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your 
 system. You now need to use KIDS to install the transport global.
  
      3.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following options:
  
            Print Transport Global
            Compare Transport Global to Current System
            Verify Checksums in Transport Global
            Backup a Transport Global
  
      4.  In accordance with the warning at the beginning of the 
 installation instructions, make sure ALL interactive processes, and 
 ALL non-interactive background jobs are stopped following your site 
 specific procedures. TaskMan should be stopped or placed in a wait state.
 All users should be off the system. NOT performing this step could result
 in 'source routine edited' error during database updates, and records may
 be left in an inconsistent state.
  
      5.  On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the 
 following option:
  
            Select Installation Option: Install Package(s)
            Select INSTALL NAME: DI*22.0*169
                                 ===========
  
 The Environment Check Routine DIPR169 runs automatically during this
 step. DIPR169 issues a warning if it appears that TaskMan is still 
 running or logons have not been inhibited.
  
            Answer 'YES' to 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
 install?'
            Answer 'NO' to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
 Options, and Protocols?'
  
      6.  Re-enable all processes stopped in step 4 above.
  
 Post Installation
 =================
 Upon successful installation of this patch, routine DIPR169 will be deleted.
