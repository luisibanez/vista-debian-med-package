  ************************************************************************
  *  If your site is using the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS), you must  * 
  *  install DSIF*3.2*17 immediately after installing FB*3.5*117 to      *
  *  avoid application/processing errors. If your site is not using      *

 This patch enhances VistA Fee Basis to enforce segregation of duties when
 payments are certified.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20080801 Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
          Misc Obligations: Implements adequate controls with respect to 
          segregation of duties and oversight by contracting officials,
          improving documentation requirements, and enhancing 1358
          reporting capabilities within Integrated Funds Distribution,
          Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) that
          will be used at the station, Veterans Integrated Service Network
          (VISN), and enterprise levels.  A Government Accountability
          Office (GAO) review questioned VHA's internal control standards
          governing the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations
          as well as oversight abilities. Direction by the Congressional
          Oversight Committee of the House.  GAO Report - GAO-08-1056T
          Improvements Needed in Design of Controls over Miscellaneous 
          Obligations, July 31, 2008.  Department of Veterans Affairs
          Memorandum, Interim Memos (Interim Guidance on Miscellaneous
          Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated January 30, 2008 AND
          Department of Veterans Affairs Memorandum, Revised Guidance for
          Processing of Miscellaneous Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated
          May 18, 2008.
  
 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1.  ENFORCE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES FOR CERTIFIER ROLE
     ------------------------------------------------
     After this patch is installed, the Release a Batch [FBAA SUPERVISOR
     RELEASE] option will not allow the user to release a payment batch if
     they are the requestor, approving official, or obligator of the 1358
     obligation (initial obligation and any adjustments) associated with
     that batch.
  
     Fee Basis will call an IFCAP application programming interface (API)
     UOKCERT^PRCEMOA to make this determination per Integration Agreement
     #5573.  The IFCAP API is added by patch PRC*5.1*152 which must be 
     installed prior to this Fee Basis patch.
  
  
 2.  ADD FEE 1358 SEGREGATION OF DUTIES REPORT
     -----------------------------------------
     This patch adds the Fee Basis 1358 Segregation of Duty Report [FB SEG 
     DUTY RPT] to the Supervisor Main Menu [FBAA SUPERVISOR OPTIONS].
     A description of the new option follows:
  
     This report reviews fee invoice certification events and determines if
     there was a segregation of duty violation.  The certifier of a fee
     invoice must not be the requestor, approving official, or obligator of
     the associated 1358 obligation or any increase/decrease adjustments to
     the 1358 that were obligated before the invoice certification took
     place.
   
     The release of a payment batch by a fee supervisor is the
     certification event.  The report examines all payment batches that
     were released during a specified period.  Each batch is associated
     with a single 1358.
   
     The results are sorted by 1358 and within that by the date and time of
     an event.  Three event types may be listed.
       Obligate - Initial obligation of the 1358 in IFCAP.  
       Adjust   - Obligation of an increase/decrease to the 1358 in IFCAP.
       Certify  - Release of a fee payment batch associated with the 1358 
                  by a fee supervisor.  The batch number is shown.  
   
     The IFCAP events have three roles (requestor, approver, and
     obligator).
   
     The specified reporting period is used to select released fee batches.
     All prior IFCAP events for the 1358 are relevant to segregation of
     duty and will be considered even if they precede the reporting period.
   
     If YES is entered at the "Only list 1358s with a violation (Y/N)?" 
     prompt, only 1358s with at least one violation will be displayed.  
     Additionally, the fee certifications (batch release) that do not
     violate segregation of duties will not be displayed. IFCAP and Fee
     Basis have been enhanced by patches PRC*5.1*148 and FB*3.5*117 to
     enforce segregation of duties for a 1358 so no violations are expected
     after installation of those patches.  
   
     The Fee Basis batch data can optionally be purged by a site.  The
     IFCAP data is normally retained for at least 7 years, but must be
     purged prior to 10 years since the document numbers are recycled. If
     the source data for this report has been purged, it will not be
     included in the report.  Selection of a period starting 9 or more
     years ago may return inaccurate results due to recycling of 1358
     document numbers.  
  
     A sample of the new report follows:
  
     Fee Basis 1358 Segregation of Duties      NOV 02, 2010@14:56:57 page 1
     Including Certifications from Oct 01, 2010 TO Oct 31, 2010 for all 
     stations
  
  
     1358       DATE/TIME      EVENT/BATCH ROLE       NAME
     ---------- -------------- ----------- ---------  --------------------

                                           APPROVER   IFCAP,CPOFFICIAL
                                           OBLIGATOR  IFCAP,ACCTECH
                10/26/10@10:11 133         CERTIFIER  FEE,SUPERVISOR
     ---------- -------------- ----------- ---------  --------------------
  
     1 batch certification was found during the report period.
     1 1358 Obligations is referenced.
     A violation of segregation of duties was detected on none of the 1358s
  
  
 3.  RETAIN TIME WHEN BATCH RELEASED
     -------------------------------
     This patch modifies the software to store the date and time instead
     of just the date in the DATE SUPERVISOR CLOSED (#5) field of the FEE
     BASIS BATCH (#161.7) file when a supervisor releases a payment batch.
  
     This patch also adds a regular cross-reference on the DATE SUPERVISOR 
     CLOSED field to support the new report.
  
  
 4.  RESTRICT DATE ON BATCH PURGE
     ----------------------------
     This patch modifies the batch purge to require the specified purge
     date to be at least 18 months in the past. The batch purge is invoked
     by directly calling routine FBAABPG and is not associated with a menu
     option.
