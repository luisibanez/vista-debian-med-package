 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD0000000347537 - PLACE OF SERVICE Code Updates 
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Place of Service codes handled by the Fee Basis software do not 
  account for all codes published by the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare
  Services.  
  
  Solution:
  ---------
  Routine FBAAFS will be modified to accommodate codes 05, 06, 07, 08, 
  16, and 17.  
  
  As of this patch, the Place of Service codes will be classified as follows:
  
  Codes considered as facility setting -
  05,06,07,08,21,22,23,24,26,31,34,41,42,51,52,53,56,61
  
  Codes considered as non-facility setting -
  01,03,04,09,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,25,32,33,49,50,54,55,57,60,62,65,71,
  72,81,99
  
 2) HD0000000196215 - ADJUSTMENT REASON CODES need to be adjusted
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The ADJUSTMENT REASON (#161.91) file needs to be updated.  Several new
  adjustment codes need to be added, some existing codes need to be marked 
  inactive, and others need to be modified.  
  
  Solution:
  ---------
  The ADJUSTMENT REASON (#161.91) file will be brought into compliance
  by adding and updating the file with all of the codes on the list 
  published at the Washington Publishing Company (WPC).  
  
  The list of codes (as of this writing) can be found at: 
  http://www.wpc-edi.com/content/view/695/1
  
  Not all codes published by the WPC are relevant to the Fee Basis package,
  as such, the following changes will specifically affect Fee Basis users.

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be installed during normal working hours.  However, as
 certain Fee Basis options are going to be placed out of order, it is 
 recommended that Fee Basis users not be on the system at the time.   
  
 Installation should take under fifteen minutes.
  
  1.  Retrieve the KIDS distribution host file. This patch will be
      distributed in a host file due to the amount of data contained in
      the patch.  The name of the host file is:
  
           FEE3_5P115.KID
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
           download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
           Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
           Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
           Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
