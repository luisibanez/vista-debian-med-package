Description:
============

 This patch enhances Fee Basis to capture additional data associated with
 Non-VA care.  Contracts can be specified for Medical Fee and Civil 
 Hospital authorizations and payments.  Civil hospital invoices will allow 
 entry of larger dollar amounts, additional diagnosis codes, present on 
 admission indicators, the admitting diagnosis code, and additional 
 procedure codes.  The existing transmissions to NVH Pricer and Central 
 Fee will be modified to include additional data elements.  The 
 transmission of these additional data elements will make it possible to 
 comply with inpatient pricing requirements and improve the ability of the 
 VA to review and report on purchased care.  
  
  
 The changes made by this patch are described below: 
  
 1.  CONTRACTED SERVICES AND CONTRACTS 
  
     This patch allows contracts to be entered for Medical Fee and Civil 
     Hospital authorizations and payments.  Payment transactions sent from 
     VistA to Central Fee will be modified to include the contract number.  
     The contract number will be used to identify payments for pilot 
     project HERO.  Contracts not associated with project HERO can also be 
     entered and tracked using the new functionality.  The new contract 
     functionality does not replace or modify the existing use of 
     contracts in the Community Nursing Home module.  This patch also 
     modifies VistA Fee Basis to prevent payments for unauthorized claims
     from being considered as contracted services.  
  
 1A. New Contract File 
  
     This patch adds a new FEE BASIS CONTRACT (#161.43) file.  This file 
     contains a list of contracts for the local site.  Each contract 
     can have one or more associated vendors.  
  
     A new option allows users to enter or edit contracts in this file.  
     The option is named Contract File Enter/Edit [FBAA CONTRACT FILE].  
     The option is locked with the FBAASUPERVISOR security key.  It is 
     attached to the Supervisor Main Menu [FBAA SUPERVISOR OPTIONS].  
  
     Four existing options are moved from the supervisor menu to a new 
     sub-menu to make room for the new contract option.  The new sub-menu 
     is the Unauthorized Claims File Menu [FBCU FILE MENU].  The options 
     moved to this menu are: 
       Add New Person for Unauthorized Claim [FBUC ADD NEW PERSON] 
       Disapproval Reasons File Enter/Edit [FBUC DISAPPROVAL REASONS FILE] 
       Dispositions File Edit [FBUC DISPOSITIONS FILE] 
       Request Info File Enter/Edit [FBUC REQUEST INFO FILE] 
  
 1B. Project HERO Contracts 
  
     The patch will automatically enter the following two contracts into 
     the FEE BASIS CONTRACT file for sites that are in VISN 8, 16, 20, or 
     23.  
       CONTRACT NUMBER       ASSOCIATED VENDOR ID 
       VA101(049A3)-P-0269   942761537 (Delta) 
       VA101049A3-P-0270     208418853 (HVHS) 
     These two contracts are for pilot project HERO.  Sites in these VISNs 
     must ensure that a project HERO contract is specified on all 
     appropriate authorizations and payments.  These contract numbers will 
     be used by the Austin database to track services provided under 
     project HERO.  
  
 1C. Identify Contract on Authorization 
  
     The patch modifies the software so users can select a contract when 
     entering or editing authorizations under the Medical Fee and Civil 
     Hospital modules.  Only contracts with an active status can be 
     selected.  Only contracts associated with the authorized vendor can
     be selected.  Therefore, contracts cannot be entered on a Medical Fee 
     authorization that does not have a specified vendor.  
  
     Note: Sites that wish to enter contracts on Medical Fee 
     authorizations must ensure the site parameter "ASK VENDOR DURING
     AUTH." is set to "Y" so vendors can be entered on the authorization.  
  
 1D. Payments for Unauthorized Claims not for a Contracted Service 
  
     This patch modifies the software to stop asking the user if a line 
     item is for a contracted service when a payment for an unauthorized 
     claim is entered or edited.  The system shall automatically consider 
     these payments as not being for contracted services.  This 
     modification will prevent an interest penalty from being applied to 
     payments for unauthorized claims.  This modification applies to 
     payments for all claims entered via the unauthorized claims module 
     including those considered under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1725 and 
     38 U.S.C. 1728.  It will not be possible to specify a contract on 
     payments for unauthorized claims.  
  
 1E. Identify Contract on Invoice/Payment 
  
     The patch modifies the software so a contract can be specified when 
     Medical Fee and Civil Hospital invoices/payments are entered or 
     edited.  The following rules will apply: 
     o If a contract is specified on the associated authorization and the 
       vendor being paid matches the vendor on the authorization, the 
       software will automatically identify the payment as a contracted 
       service under the same contract as on the authorization.  
     o If the contract is not automatically selected due to the 
       authorization (see above) and the user indicates that the line item 
       is for a contracted service, the user is prompted for a contract.  
       This is an optional field.  Only contracts with an active status
       can be selected.  Only contracts associated with the vendor being
       paid can be selected.  
     
  
 2.  ADDITIONAL DATA AND LARGER $ AMOUNTS FOR CIVIL HOSPITAL INVOICE 
  
     This patch modifies civil hospital authorizations and invoices and 
     the Generic Pricer option.  The maximum dollar amount is increased 
     from $999,999.99 to $9,999,999.99.  The maximum number of diagnosis 
     codes and maximum number of procedure codes is increased from 5 to
     25.  
  
     Additional data elements must be entered on the invoice and generic 
     Pricer.  A present on admission indicator (POA) must be entered for 
     each diagnosis code.  An admitting diagnosis code must be entered.  
     These new data elements will be included in the message sent to the 
     NVH Pricer system and in the B9 payment transaction sent to Central 
     Fee.  
  
 2A. Present on Admission Indicator 
  
     This patch modifies the software to require entry of a POA (present
     on admission indicator) for each diagnosis code on a civil hospital 
     invoice and generic Pricer.  An example follows: 
  
     POA1: ? 
           Enter the present on admission indicator for the ICD1 
           diagnosis.         Answer with PRESENT ON ADMISSION CODE 
       Choose from: 
       1        Unreported/Not used.  Exempt from POA reporting.  
       N        Diagnosis was not present at time of inpatient admission.  
       U        Documentation insufficient to determine.  
       W        Provider unable to clinically determine.  
       Y        Diagnosis was present at time of inpatient admission.  
  
 2B. Admitting Diagnosis 
  
     This patch modifies the software to require entry of an Admitting 
     Diagnosis on a civil hospital invoice and a generic Pricer. 
     An example follows: 
  
     ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: ? 
         Enter the admitting diagnosis for this claim.  
      Answer with ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE NUMBER, or DESCRIPTION 
      Do you want the entire 14954-Entry ICD DIAGNOSIS List? 
  
  
 3.  SEND EDI CLAIM IDENTIFIER TO CENTRAL FEE 
  
     This patch modifies VistA Fee Basis to include an EDI identifier in 
     the B3 (outpatient and ancillary), B5 (pharmacy), and B9 (civil 
     hospital and community nursing home) payment transactions that are 
     sent to Central Fee.  No additional data entry is required since EDI 
     claims will be identified using the existing FPPS CLAIM ID field.  
  
  
 4.  SEND PATIENT ACCOUNT NUMBER TO CENTRAL FEE 
  
     This patch modifies VistA Fee Basis to include the value of the 
     existing PATIENT ACCOUNT NUMBER field in the B3 (outpatient and 
     ancillary) payment transaction that is sent to Central Fee.  
     This patch modifies VistA Fee Basis to include the value of the 
     existing PATIENT CONTROL NUMBER field in the B9 (civil hospital and 
     community nursing home) payment transaction that is sent to Central 
     Fee.  
  
  
 5.  REDUCE RISK OF INTERFACE ERRORS 
  
     This patch contains new line limits for payment batches.  It also 
     examines several data fields that are sent in a batch message to 
     ensure the space allotted for that field is not exceeded.  
  
 5A. Batch Line Limits 
  
     Central Fee can only accept 32K characters in a single payment 
     batch.  Since this patch includes additional data in payment batches, 
     the maximum number of lines in a batch must be reduced to avoid a 
     reject of the entire batch by Central Fee.  
  
     This patch reduces the maximum size of a payment batch from 100 to 85 
     lines.  This limit applies to the B3 (outpatient and ancillary) and B5 
     (pharmacy) payment batches.  This patch introduces a maximum 42 line 
     limit for the contract hospital batch and a maximum 61 line limit for 
     the community nursing home batch.  
  
     The following site parameters control these limits.  
  
     MAX # PAYMENT LINE ITEMS: 85// ?? 
         The maximum number of payment line items that will be allowed in
         a batch.  Any number between 1 and 85 is acceptable. This value
         is checked during the enter payment options and will warn the
         clerks when they are within 20 of the maximum. It will prevent
         the clerks from exceeding this number.  
    
     MAX # CH PAYMENT LINES: 42// ?? 
         The maximum number of payment line items that will be allowed in
         a contract hospital batch.  This value is checked during the
         enter payment options and will warn the clerks when they are
         within 5 of the maximum.  It will prevent the clerks from 
         exceeding this number.  
    
     MAX # CNH PAYMENT LINES: 61// ?? 
         The maximum number of payment line items that will be allowed in
         a community nursing home batch.  This value is checked during the 
         enter payment options and will warn the clerks when they are 
         within 5 of the maximum. It will prevent the clerks from
         exceeding this number.  
    
 5B. Length of Stay on Pricer Transaction 
  
     The NVH Pricer system in Austin does not support a length of stay 
     greater than 999 days.  The message sent from VistA to the NVH Pricer 
     only allocates 3 digits for the computed length of stay value.
     Austin has reported instances where the message sent from VistA has
     included more than 3 digits for the length of stay resulting in a
     formatting error.  
  
     This patch modifies the Generic Pricer option to prevent entry of a 
     discharge date that is more than 999 days after the admission date.  
     This patch also modifies the Pricer batch message to send "***" as
     the length of stay if the computed value exceeds 3 digits. This will 
     result in a reject of the line by the NVH Pricer, but the remaining 
     lines in the batch will no longer be adversely impacted.  
  
               
 5C. State Abbreviation 
  
     The message sent to the NVH Pricer and the B3, B5, and B9 payment 
     batch sent to Central Fee contain a two character state abbreviation.  
     In some cases, the 'state' CANADA was selected.  This 'state' has a 
     five character abbreviation in the STATE file and the entire value 
     was being placed in the message resulting in a format error.  
  
     This patch modifies these messages to send "**" as the state 
     abbreviation if the state abbreviation exceeds 2 characters.  This 
     will result in a reject of the line, but the remaining lines in the 
     batch will no longer be adversely impacted.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview 
  
 Remedy Ticket #479393  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Patch FB*3.5*116 created an error in the Fee Basis routine
 FBAACO2 when it mistakenly killed the variable FBAAMM1.
  
 The reported issue is that patch FB*3.5*116 broke some functionality that
 was introduced by patch FB*3.5*4 (released 9/23/1999).  This was the patch
 that added the RBRVS fee schedule to VistA. The problem only occurs on the
 second and subsequent lines for an invoice that has been marked as
  contracted services.  For these subsequent lines:
  
 a. The user is no longer reminded that the payment is for contracted
    services before the amount paid is asked.
  
 b. The software is inappropriately providing a default amount paid for these
    contracted services (the lesser of the amount claimed or fee schedule
    amount)
  
 c. The FEE SCHEDULE and FEE SCHEDULE AMOUNT fields are being inappropriately
    populated with data.  This may result in an inappropriate payment symbol
    of "R" or "F" being shown instead of the appropriate
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Resolution to this error was to remove the erroneous kill from
 FBAACO2. 
  
 Remedy Ticket #603189  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 On the Potential Cost Recovery Report patch FB*3.5*122 displays the
 optional line rendering provider data for civil hospital invoice after
 the associated procedure code.  However, the patch is inappropriately
 assuming that the .01 LINE ITEM NUMBER value entered by the user matches
 the internal entry number assigned by FileMan for that entry.  When that
 is not true, the line rendering provider is shown with the wrong
 procedure code.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The Resolution to this error was to make the selection based not
 on the internal entry number but on the .01 LINE ITEM NUMBER value.
