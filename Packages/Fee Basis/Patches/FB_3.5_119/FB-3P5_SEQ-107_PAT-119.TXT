Description:
============

 This build is a multi-package build that contains FB*3.5*119 and
 PXRM*2.0*20.  See the Clinical Reminders patch PXRM*2.0*20 for a complete
 patch description.
  
 The Access Received Closer to Home (ARCH) Automated Eligibility 
 Determination project is an interface between Veterans Health Information 
 Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)/Computerized Patient Record 
 System (CPRS), and a data set containing geo-spatial information on 
 eligible Veterans.  The Veterans' Mental Health And Other Care 
 Improvements Act Of 2008, Section 403, Public Law 110-387 mandates that
 the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) conduct a pilot program over
 three years for contract care of eligible Veterans in selected Veterans
 Integrated Service Networks (VISNs).  The Office of Policy Analysis within
 the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy
 and Planning (ADUSH/PP) requested the capability to automatically identify
 all Veterans who are eligible for a high visibility Congressionally
 mandated contract care pilot program (named Project ARCH, Access to Care
 Received Closer to Home) in five VISNs (1, 6, 15, 18, and 19).
  
 Automated notification of ARCH eligibility is accomplished using 
 clinical reminders.  Patient eligibility information comes from an 
 ADUSH/PP database which has been imported into the VistA FEE BASIS 
 PATIENT file (#161). A clinical reminders computed finding uses a Fee 
 Basis API to get patient eligibility information. For eligible patients, 
 there is a reminder dialog the provider can use to record that the 
 patient does not need any of the covered services, or if the patient does 
 need one of the covered services whether the patient declines or 
 consents. If the patient consents, then a locally developed consult will 
 be opened.
  
 When veterans come to one of the pilot sites, they are informed that they 
 may be eligible for Project ARCH.  Services covered under the pilot are 
 listed in the reminder dialog (list of clinical services varies by VISN), 
 and the Care Coordinator will record one of the following:  
  
     Veteran does not need a covered service
     Veteran needs covered service, was informed of pilot and consents 
           to participate
     Veteran needs covered service, was informed of pilot, and does 
           not consent to participate
  
 Note:  The Fee Basis patch FB*3.5*119 will only import the eligibility 
        data and there are no additional or modified Fee Basis options.

 $$ELIG^FBARCH0(DFN,DT1,DT2,DATA) - returns if pt is ARCH eligible or NOT.
 $$LIST^FBARCH0(DT1,DT2) - returns a list of ARCH patients w/in the date 
                           range.

 DATA STORAGE ESTIMATES:
 =======================
 Once the ARCH Eligibility is imported, the global growth is very 
 minimal.  Eligibility updates will take place only through a patch.
 The initial size of the ARCH Eligibility from Cheyenne's system is
 4 megabytes.  And, for integrated sites, the size could be tripled.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 This patch may be installed during normal working hours with all users on
 the system. It is not necessary to disable any menu options or protocols
 when installing this patch. However, it is recommended that the install
 be done during non-peak hours to lessen the impact on system performance.

 1.  Retrieve the multi-build KIDS distribution host file. This patch
     will be distributed in a host file due to the amount of data
     contained in the patch.  The name of the host file is:
  
          ARCH_PILOT_PROJECT_1_0.KID
  
     Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
     The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
          download.vista.med.va.gov
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
     Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
          Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
          Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
          Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
     The ARCH_PILOT_PROJECT_1_0.KID host file is located in the
     anonymous.software directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the
     file.
  
 2.  Load the KIDS distribution that is contained in file
     ARCH_PILOT_PROJECT_1_0.KID using the Load a Distribution option on the
