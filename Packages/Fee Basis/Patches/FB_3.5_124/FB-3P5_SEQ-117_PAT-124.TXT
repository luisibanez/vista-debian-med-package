  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch contains the modified components (Routines and Input 
 Templates) which implement the VistA Financials Annual Enhancement called 
 VistA Fee Invoice Acceptance Date Controls (NSR# 20080613).  The intent 
 of this patch is to prevent a Fee Basis Invoice from being approved for 
 payment, if the Invoice was received at the VA prior to the date(s) of 
 service for the services being billed on the Invoice.
  
 The new checks are implemented at the field level as needed, wherever 
 either the Invoice Received Date, or the Date(s) of Service for an 
 Invoice are entered. The menu options affected are listed in Step 6 of the
 Installation Instructions below.  In cases where the Invoice Received Date
 is entered first, the user will not be allowed to enter a Date of Service
 which is later than the Invoice Received Date.  If the Date(s) of Service
 are entered first, the user will not be allowed to enter an Invoice
 Received Date which is prior to the Date(s) of Service.  If a user is
 editing a previously entered Invoice, where both types of dates have
 already been entered, they will not be allowed to edit either the Date of
 Service, or the Invoice Received Date, if they try to enter a new value
 which results in the Invoice Received Date being prior to the Date(s) of
 Service.  The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1.  The system will perform a validity check that cannot be made until 
 both dates are entered.  Either date may be entered first.  The 
 modifications are implemented as field-level validity checks added where 
 each of these date fields appear in the various options affected.
  
 2.  The date-check code will first determine whether the Claim Received
 Date and the Date of Service have both been entered.  If both dates 
 have not yet been entered, then no comparison can be made, so the 
 validity check code will take no further action when the first date is 
 entered.
  
 3.  If both dates have been entered and if the Claim Received Date is 
 PRIOR TO the Date of Service, the second date entered will not be
 accepted.
  
 4.  Software cannot determine whether an invalid pair of dates is the 
 result of a user entry error, or of a claim being submitted with invalid 
 dates.  The system will notify the user when an error has been detected 
 and reject the date just entered.  The user will then determine what 
 action to take (i.e. re-enter the current date, go back and modify the 
 first date entered, or exit the claim.) 
  
 The application will not allow the entry of both a Claim Received Date 
 and a Date of Service, where the Claim Received Date is prior to the Date 
 of Service.  Since both dates are required before a claim can be accepted 
 and sent to Central Fee at the Austin Information Technology Center 
 (AITC), this will prevent a claim from being submitted for payment with a 
 Claim Received Date that is prior to the Date of Service.
