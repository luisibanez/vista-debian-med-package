  ************************************************************************
  *  If your site is using the Fee Basis Claims System (FBCS), you must  * 
  *  install DSIF*3.2*10 immediately after installing FB*3.5*116 to      *
  *  avoid application/processing errors. If your site is not using      *
  *  FBCS, there is no need to install the FBCS patch.                   *
  *                                                                      *

 The Chief Business Office (CBO) requested an enhancement to the VistA Fee
 Basis package that will report $0 amount paid line items at local Fee and
 national systems. Although VistA Fee Basis captures line items that are
 not reimbursed ($0 payment line items), these line items have not been
 transmitted to national financial processing systems as these systems had
 not been designed to process $0 line items. Consequently, these line items
 were not included in workload reporting, and since the remittance advice
 and explanation of benefits provided to non-VA health care providers does
 not include $0 line items, they are not considered Health Insurance
 Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant.
  
 Enhancements to the existing VistA Fee Basis software application will 
 allow for transmittal of payment line items that have $0 amount paid. The
 Central Fee system located at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) 
 and the Fee Payment Processing System (FPPS) located at the Health 
 Administration Center (HAC) are the external systems that will need to be 
 able to receive and process the $0 amount paid line items.
  
  
 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 Queue Data for Transmission [FBAA QUEUE DATA FOR TRANS.] - Transmits to 
 Central Fee in Austin FEE payments and Master Record Adjustments (MRA)
 using Mailman. The software that supports this option was modified to
 remove the software that prevented the $0 amount paid line items being
 exported to Central Fee.
  
 Release a Batch [FBAA SUPERVISOR RELEASE] - Releases a payment batch that 
 is ready to be transmitted to Central Fee. Since the systematic queue of 
 EDI invoices with $0.00 line items gets performed when VistA receives the 
 payment confirmation/cancellation results  from Central Fee, the Release 
 a Batch software was modified to no longer queue EDI invoices with a total 
 amount paid of $0.00 to the FPPS QUEUED INVOICES file (#163.5). 
  
 As there are restrictions on the size of a batch that Central Fee can 
 receive and process, the software that supports the payment processing 
 options was modified to include the payment lines that have $0 amount paid
 in the line count of a given batch. The count value is populated in the 
 PAYMENT LINE COUNT field (#10) of the FEE BASIS BATCH (#161.7) file.  The 
 following options were modified:
  
    Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
    C&P/Multiple Patient Payment Entry [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
    Multiple Ancillary Payments [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
    Multiple Payment Entry [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
    Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
    Close-out Batch [FBAA CLOSE BATCH]
    Closeout Pharmacy Invoice [FBAA CLOSE OUT INVOICE]
    List Items in Batch [FBAA LIST BATCH]
  
  
 The software that supports the Close-out Batch [FBAA CLOSE BATCH]
 option shall be modified to prevent Medical Fee and Pricer Exempt Civil
 Hospital payment batches from being closed when zero dollar ($0.00) amount
 paid invoice(s) exist on the batch. The batch shall remain in the "OPEN"
 status until the zero dollar invoice(s) has/have been removed from the
 batch or corrected to reflect non-zero dollar line items.
  
 The software that supports the Release a Batch [FBAA SUPERVISOR RELEASE]
 option shall be modified to prevent Pricer Non-Exempt Civil Hospital
 payment batches being released when zero dollar ($0.00) amount paid
 invoice(s) exist on the batch. The batch shall remain in the "ASSIGNED
 PRICE" status until the zero dollar invoice(s) have been removed from the
 batch or  corrected to reflect non-zero dollar line items.
  
 The software that supports the Closeout Pharmacy Invoice [FBAA CLOSE OUT
 INVOICE] option shall be modified to prevent batch assignment to Pharmacy
 invoices that have been entered as zero dollar ($0.00) amount paid. The
 Line Item Status on the Pharmacy invoice shall remain in "Pending Payment
 Process" until the zero dollar amount paid line item(s) is/ are removed
 from the invoice or is corrected to reflect non-zero dollar.
  
 The payment software issues a prompt so that the user can identify if the 
 payment lines are to be subject to interest penalty payments. The options
 that process the entry and edit of Medical Fee payments and Ancillary 
 payments were modified to no longer gather interest indicators at the
 payment line level. This means that the user interface prompt, "Is this
 line item for a contracted service?", will no longer be issued for each
 payment line. Line items for contracted services will now reflect the
 interest indicator as it was answered at the invoice level. The PROMPT
 PAY TYPE field (#34) of the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file will get
 populated with the interest indicator value captured at the invoice level
 for proper processing at the Central Fee system and the Financial 
 Management System (FMS).  The following options were modified:
  
    Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
    Edit Ancillary Payment [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
    Edit Payment [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
    Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
    Payments for Unauthorized Claims [FBUC PAYMENTS]
  
  
 The Fee Basis patch FB*3.5*116 has an environment check routine that 
 checks for batches that are "in-process". Batches with a status of 
 'CLERK CLOSED', 'SUPERVISOR CLOSED' and 'REVIEWED AFTER PRICER' are 
 examined to determine if zero dollar ($0.00) amount paid invoices exist.
 If it is determined that "in-process" batches exist, then the installation
 of FB*3.5*116 will terminate; an abort message is generated and displayed
 to the installer of the patch; a Mailman bulletin will be generated that
 will identify the batches with $0 invoices and will instruct the Fee staff
 of the proper action; and the bulletin will be sent to the FEE mailgroup.
 Until further action is performed by the Fee staff, the patch cannot be
 installed.
 
 Please refer to the Release Notes distributed with this patch for more 
 detailed steps on how to resolve $0 invoices that may be on the system.
