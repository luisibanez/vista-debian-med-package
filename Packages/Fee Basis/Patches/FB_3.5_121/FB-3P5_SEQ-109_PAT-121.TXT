Subject: HIPAA 5010 PROVIDER AND BANK INFORMATION

Description:
============

 General Description:
 --------------------
 This patch enhances the VistA Fee Basis software for the Health
 Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 5010
 compliance mandated prior to Jan 1, 2012. It includes new fields
 for storing HIPAA 5010 provider and bank information in order to
 generate minimally mandated 5010 requirements for 837 and 835 claims.
  
 The patch creates fields for HIPAA 5010 provider and bank data and
 allows VistA Fee Basis to receive and process both the current 82
 character message and new 138 character message from Central Fee
 (AITC) containing bank name, routing and account information. Central
 Fee (AITC) transmits the payment confirmation message to VistA. This
 patch must be released nationally prior to the change in message
 length from Central Fee.

 New Service Request (NSRs):
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 20090705 VistA Fee HIPAA 5010 Implementation, Discovery and Requirements
          To meet the expanding needs of Electronic Data Interchange
          (EDI) processes and address the system and data changes
          required with the 5010 version, the Fee Basis package will need
          to collect, store and report additional elements from the claim
          data.  National Provider Identifiers (NPI) and physical service
          locations are needed to better inform downstream or dependent
          processes.  Much of the additional data collection is needed to
          support (1) revenue functions, where a third party insurance
          has a financial obligation surrounding payments made for
          non-service connected episodes of care and (2) pricing
          functions, where the service location impacts the allowed
          amount for a healthcare service.
  
   Note: This is the first of three patches for this NSR
  
 The enhancements made by this patch are described below:
  
 1. ADD HIPPA 5010 FIELDS TO VISTA FEE BASIS
  
  Problem:
  --------
  VistA Fee Basis needs additional fields to store minimally required
  HIPAA 5010 claim and payment information
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Created HIPAA 5010 provider name, NPI, Taxonomy code and bank fields in
  the following files: FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162), and FEE BASIS INVOICE
  (#162.5). Created HIPAA 5010 Taxonomy code field in FEE BASIS VENDOR
  (#161.2) file. Created FPPS transmit start and stop dates in the FEE
  BASIS SITE PARAMETERS (#161.4) file.
  
 2. ENSURE FB FPPS TRANSMIT OPTION CAN BE RUN BY ANY USER
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The FB FPPS TRANSMIT option contains the security key FBAASUPERVISOR,
  but not all users who queue this report have the key so the option
  does not run.  This affects payment data being sent to the Fee Payment
  Processing System (FPPS) in a timely manner.  If a site has not
  transmitted the data regularly, there may be network issues (rare).
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The post-installation routine removes the FBAASUPERVISOR key from the
  FB FPPS TRANSMIT option and requests that IRM set this queuable option
  up to run on a nightly basis.  FBHLX and FBHLX1 were modified to limit
  the number of records sent to FPPS to 10K.  The 10K limit was imposed
  to ensure the network is not overburdened by sites that have not run
  the FB FPPS TRANSMIT option on a regular cycle (daily).  If the process
  stops due to the 10K limit then the message sent to G.FEE will contain
  a note "Process (task) stopped due reaching 10K message limit." to the
  users.
  
 3. ALLOW FEE BASIS TO PROCESS 82 AND 138 CHARACTER PAYMENT PROCESSING
    MESSAGES FROM CENTRAL FEE.
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Modification of the Central Fee Payment Processing message (DHCPOUT)
  to include bank information will allow Health Administration Center
  (HAC) personnel to receive this information automatically rather than
  performing a manual lookup to enter this data into the 835 payment
  message.
  
  Solution:
  ---------
  Modified the FBPAID and FBPAID1 routines that process the DHCPOUT
  file from Central Fee to accept either 82 or 138 characters.  The
  longer message will contain bank routing number (9 characters),
  account number (17 characters) and bank name (30 characters).  This
  data will be filed to the FEE BASIS PAYMENT (#162) or FEE BASIS
  INVOICE (#162.5) file depending on the fee program.  This change is
  dependent on modifications from Central Fee and the new data will
  not be available until Central Fee releases their production
  changes.

  Patch Installation:
  
  Pre/Post-Installation Overview
  ------------------------------
  The post-install routine FBXIP121 will remove the security key
  FBAASUPERVISOR from the FB FPPS TRANSMIT option.  Users queuing this
  report do not always have the key which prevents the data from being
  transmitted in a regular manner to FPPS.
  
  The FB FPPS TRANSMIT option should be queued to run nightly.  See the
  installation steps for details about timing of the nightly job.  The FB
  FPPS TRANSMIT option should be queued to reduce the dependence on the
  interactive menu option.  This ensures that payment records are sent from
  all facilities on a nightly basis.
  
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 Users may be on the system during installation.  If installed during the
 normal workday, it is recommended that the following selections in the
 OPTION (#19) file, and all of their descendants be disabled to prevent
 possible conflicts while running the KIDS Install. Other VistA users
 will not be affected.

  Post-Installation Instructions:
  -------------------------------
  The post-install routine FBXIP121 will remove the security key
  FBAASUPERVISOR from the FB FPPS TRANSMIT option.  Users queuing
  this report do not always have the key which prevents the data
  from being transmitted in a regular manner to FPPS.
  
  Once the patch has been successfully installed you may delete the
  post install routine: FBXIP121
  
  1. Ensure that the FB FPPS TRANSMIT option is queued to run on
     a nightly basis.
  
    **NOTE** If your site is already running this task nightly,
    then no action is needed.
  
    **Otherwise, schedule FB FPPS TRANMIT per FB*3.5*61 SEQ # 58: **
    The Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT] option should be
    scheduled to run on a daily basis at a local time that is equivalent
    to 23:00 Central Time.  This timing will transmit payment
    confirmations to FPPS shortly after they have  been received from the
    AAC, but before FPPS runs its daily job to generate HIPAA 835
    remittance advice transactions.
