Associated patches: (v)FB*3.5*119  <<= must be installed BEFORE `FB*3.5*130'

Subject: PROJECT ARCH INCREMENT 2

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Veterans' Mental Health And Other Care Improvements Act Of 2008, 
 Section 403, Public Law 110-387 mandates that the Department of
 Veterans Affairs (VA) conduct a pilot program over three years for
 contract care  of eligible Veterans in selected Veterans Integrated
 Service Networks (VISNs).
  
 The Office of Policy Analysis within the Office of the Assistant
 Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning
 (ADUSH/PP) requested the capability to automatically identify all
 Veterans who are eligible for a high visibility Congressionally
 mandated contract care pilot  program (named Project ARCH, Access to
 Care Received Closer to Home) in five VISNs (1, 6, 15, 18, and 19).
  
 Patch FB*3.5*130 contains Project ARCH enhancements, which allow for
 authorized users that hold the FB ARCH Security Key to identify patients
 that were not included in the original Project ARCH Increment 1
 eligibility dataset and allow them to be marked as being Project ARCH
 Eligible in the local VistA system. The system now allows locally added
 patients to be marked Not Project ARCH Eligible by users that hold the FB
 ARCH Security Key. This patch also includes a "View Project ARCH
 Eligibility" option that allows authorized users to view nationally and 
 locally identified Project ARCH patients.
  
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1. Project ARCH Menu is now included in Fee Basis Main Menu and is
    accessible by users who hold the FB ARCH security key.
  
 2. Users are restricted from editing ARCH eligibility status for
    patients that have been determined to be ARCH eligible through
    the national eligibility dataset.
  
 3. System requires a justification for patients that have been
    locally determined ARCH eligible before adding them to the local
    dataset. Justification is selected from a provided list of reasons.
  
 4. System requires the user to enter the Verification of mileage for
    patients that have been locally determined ARCH eligible before
    adding them to the local dataset.  
  
 5. The "View Project ARCH Eligibility" option now allows authorized
    users the ability to sort ARCH eligibility data in different views.
    This option also allows users to view data for either a specific
    patient or all ARCH eligible patients and to limit the data to a
    certain date range. Users can now search for entries where the most
    current ARCH eligibility entry matches the selected status
    (Eligible / Not Eligible / Both).
  
 6. System allows the user the ability to queue the output of the "View
    Project ARCH Eligibility" option to run in the background, print to a
    specific device, or print to Excel formatted text.
