Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This build is a multi-package build that contains FB*3.5*138
 and PXRM*2.0*23. It supports the third increment for Project ARCH 
 (Access to Care Received Closer to Home).
  
 The Veterans' Mental Health And Other Care Improvements Act Of 2008, 
 Section 403, Public Law 110-387 mandates that the Department of
 Veterans  Affairs (VA) conduct a pilot program over three years for
 contract care of eligible Veterans in selected Veterans Integrated
 Service Networks (VISNs).
  
 The Office of Policy Analysis within the Office of the Assistant
 Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning
 (ADUSH/PP) requested the capability to automatically identify all
 Veterans who are eligible for a high visibility Congressionally
 mandated contract care pilot program (named Project ARCH, Access to
 Care Received Closer to Home) in  five VISNs (1, 6, 15, 18, and 19).
  
 FB*3.5*138:
 This build adds the PROJECT ARCH REMINDER DELAY field (#38) to the 
 FEE BASIS SITE PARAMETERS file (#161.4) that allows sites to customize
 number of days that the Project ARCH Clinical Reminder will become
 due again after the patient Declines or Refuses services offered.
  
 Two new options are also installed on the Project ARCH Menu. 
 - The ARCH Eligibility Data Upload option allows sites to upload 
   the national Project ARCH data extract files that contain the updates 
   for Project ARCH Eligibility. 
 - The ARCH Clinical Reminder Due Delay option sets the value in the new
   PROJECT ARCH REMINDER DELAY field with a number between 1 and 180 days.
