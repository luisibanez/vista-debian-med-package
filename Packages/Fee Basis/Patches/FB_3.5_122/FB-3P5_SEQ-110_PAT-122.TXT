 This patch enhances the VistA Fee Basis software for 5010 compliance.
 It includes changes to VistA options (routines/input templates) to allow
 sites to edit the new fields for storing Health Insurance Portability
 and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 5010 provider information and for VistA
 Integrated Billing (IB) to view the 5010 data on the Potential Cost
 Recovery Report (PCRR).  These changes are necessary in order to
 generate minimally mandated 5010 requirements for 837 and 835 claim
 transactions prior to Jan 1, 2012.
  
 The patch modifies VistA Fee Basis routines and input templates for
 creating/editing and displaying claim and invoice data for HIPAA 5010
 provider data (name, NPI, Taxonomy code).   It also includes changes to
 the Health Level 7 (HL7) message format sent from VistA Fee Basis to the
 Fee Payment Processing System (FPPS) to include bank name, routing and
 account number data for Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) claims processed
 by the Treasury.  The patch includes a new Fee Basis monitoring option
 that will process in the background and alert Fee users and national
 Fee personnel if the Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT] option
 has not been running in a timely manner.

 ENHANCEMENTS TO THE VISTA FEE BASIS APPLICATION
 =======================================================================
 1. Editing new 5010 fields for Claim and Invoice options
    The following options will now display new fields to allow Fee users
    to edit HIPAA 5010 provider name, NPI and Taxonomy codes, as well
    as the Servicing Facility address information:
        Enter Invoice/Payment [FBCH ENTER PAYMENT]
        Invoice Edit [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT]
        Invoice Display [FBCH INVOICE DISPLAY]
        Edit Payment [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
        Enter Payment [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
        Invoice Display [FBAA INVOICE DISPLAY]
  
    The routines and input templates that were modified for these options
    are:
    FBCH ENTER PAYMENT - FBCHEP, (Template-FBCH ENTER PAYMENT), FBUTL8
    FBCH EDIT PAYMENT - FBCHEP1, (Template-FBCH EDIT PAYMENT)
    FBCH INVOICE DISPLAY - FBCHDI2, FBCHVH
    FBAA EDIT PAYMENT - FBAAPET
    FBAA ENTER PAYMENT - FBAACO, FBAACO2, FBAACO3
    FBAA INVOICE DISPLAY - FBAAPIN
  
  
 2. Potential Cost Recovery Report [FB PCR]
    The Potential Cost Recovery Report will now contain new 5010
    provider data.  FBPCR2, FBPCR67, FBPCR671 were modified to
    display provider name, NPI and Taxonomy codes, and Servicing
    Facility address for the following 5010
    provider fields:
       Attending Name, NPI and Taxonomy Code
       Operating Name, NPI
       Rendering Name, NPI and Taxonomy Code
       Servicing Name, NPI
       Servicing Facility Address and City, State, ZIP
       Referring Name, NPI
  
 3. Transmit Invoices to FPPS [FB FPPS TRANSMIT]
    a. Modified the HL7 processing routines that process the payment
       response data from Central Fee to include bank routing number
       (9 characters), account number (17 characters) and bank name
       (30 characters) for EFT claims. The FT1 segment, field 30 will
       contain this data in the format: routing#^^^^^^^^acct#&name
       FT1||111999000999-1|50|20110603||FWT|1||||750.00|||||||||||
       |12344321050|||||||001019099^^^^^^^^123456789&WELLS FARGO BANK
    b. Routine FBFHLX was modified to save the start date/time and, when
       finished, the end date/time of the transmit option. It was also
       modified to record the record number being processed, and the
       date/time the record's processing started. Routine FBFHLX1 also
       was modified to record the record number being processed, and the
       date/time the record's processing started
  
 4. Monitor status of FB FPPS TRANSMIT option [FB FPPS MONITOR]
    A new monitor option has been created to inform the G.FEE mail group
    internally through vista and mail group Fee.EDI_Issues externally
    through Outlook when issues are found with the FPPS TRANSMIT
    function. The monitor checks the FEE BASIS SITE PARAMETERS file
    (#161.4) fields: FPPS TRANSMIT START (#36) and FPPS TRANSMIT END
    (#37). If the date/time in the FPPS TRANSMIT START field is older
    than 2 days, a MailMan message will be sent informing the mail
    groups that the FPPS TRANSMIT has not been run. If the monitor
    determines that the last record update has been more that 1 hour
    ago, and the FPPS TRANSMIT START date/time is more recent than
    the FPPS TRANSMIT END, a MailMan message will be sent that the
    FPPS TRANSMIT has stalled with an error. The option is a
    schedulable option and will not be added to any FB menu. The
    new routine associated with this option is FBMON.
  
 5. Display, Enter, Edit Demographics [FBAA VENDOR DEMOGRAPHICS]
    The Vendor edit option was modified to be able to view the HIPAA 5010
    provider Taxonomy code if available.  Routine FBAAVD was modified to
    display the Taxonomy code below the Billing Provider NPI if the
    Taxonomy code exists. The input templates (FBAA EDIT VENDOR) and
    (FBAA NEW VENDOR) were updated with the new taxonomy code.
