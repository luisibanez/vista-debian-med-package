  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1) HD0000000237917 - FGH - FEE BASIS BATCH NUMBER file questions 
  
  Problem:
  ========
  When using the options Delete reject flag [FBAA VOUCHER DELETE REJECT] and
  Re-initiate Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REINITIATE REJECTS] to finalize 
  batches with rejected items, the software is creating new cross-references
  with the current date and not deleting previous cross-references. 
  This is resulting in extraneous cross-references.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The routines FBAARD and FBAARR have been modified to use FileMan to update
  the user who entered, date finalized and status fields.  This prevents 
  the creation of extraneous cross-references.  
  
  Post-install routine FBXIP114 will re-index the "AF" cross-reference on 
  the DATE FINALIZIED field (#13) in the FEE BASIS BATCH (#161.7) file to
  clean up the extraneous cross-references.  
  
  2) HD0000000333483 - FGH - data populated when accessing ENTER UNAUTHORIZED 
                       CLAIM option
  
  Problem:
  ========
  When entering the ENTER UNAUTHORIZED CLAIM [FBUC ENTER] option after using 
  the View Registration Data [DG REGISTRATION VIEW] option, the user is 
  presented with a default patient.  At this point, there shouldn't be a 
  patient selected at all.   
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The routine FBUCEN has been modified to new FileMan variables prior to 
  calling FileMan so that the previous value isn't retained.  
  
  3) HD0000000354967 - OPENING A BATCH ISSUE
  
  Problem:
  ========
  When a site is running low on available batches (101 or less), the 
  user should receive a warning instructing them to contact their 
  Information Resources Management (IRM) department to run a purge.  
  The users are currently not receiving the warning because the 
  calculation is incorrect.  
  
  In routine FBAAUTL, some locks are not compliant with SAC standards.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  The routine FBAAUTL should be looking at the file header for the 
  FEE BASIS BATCH (#161.7) file.  If this number is greater than 99899,
  the user should be warned that the site is running low on batches so 
  that they can take necessary action.  
  
  Locks in routine FBAAUTL are now SAC compliant.  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  This patch may be installed during normal working hours.  However, as
  certain Fee Basis options are going to be placed out of order, it is 
  recommended that Fee Basis users not be on the system at the time.   
  
  Installation should take under five minutes.
  
  The post install routine FBXIP114 may be deleted upon successful 
  installation of this patch.

          DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
