  ************************************************************************
  
 The changes made by patch FB*3.5*132 are described below:
  
 This patch will enhance the interface between VistA Fee Basis and Central
 Fee to improve the consistency of payment line item data between the
 systems.  This will prevent duplicate ICN payments by ensuring that a 
 payment line cannot be reprocessed in VistA Fee Basis unless it has been 
 removed from Central Fee.  The primary interface enhancements consist of 
 the following:
  o Rejection of payment line items by Central Fee will be transmitted to
    VistA Fee Basis via new transactions that update the VistA database.  
    Users will no longer manually record such rejects in VistA.
  o Completion of a payment batch using the Finalize a Batch option in
    VistA Fee Basis will automatically generate a new transaction that is
    sent to Central Fee.  This new transaction will instruct Central Fee of
    any payment line items that must be deleted (i.e. local rejects) and
    instruct Central Fee to release the remainder of the batch to
    downstream payment systems such as FMS.  This new transaction will
    replace all use of 994 code sheets in IFCAP.
 This patch also resolves three existing software faults that were 
 discovered during analysis and design of the patch.
  
 A detailed description of the enhancements follow:
  
  1. AUTOMATE PAYMENT BATCH RESULTS
  
     A new interface transaction will be sent from Central Fee to VistA Fee
     Basis.  This transaction will contain the results from processing a 
     payment batch that was sent from VistA to Central Fee.  The new
     interface is intended to replace the current manual identification,
     using the Finalize a Batch option of payment lines that were rejected
     due to Central Fee edit checks.
  
     This patch adds a new value (CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED) to the STATUS field
     of the FEE BASIS BATCH file.  This new value chronologically falls
     between the existing TRANSMITTED and VOUCHERED status values.
  
     The system will update the batch status upon successful processing of
     a Payment Batch Results message.  The status shall be set to CENTRAL
     FEE ACCEPTED (F) unless all payment lines in the batch have been
     flagged as rejected.  The status shall be set to VOUCHERED (V) if all
     payment lines in the batch have been flagged as rejected.
  
  
  2. ENHANCE FINALIZE A BATCH OPTION
  
     The Finalize a Batch [FBAA FINALIZE BATCH] option is currently used to
     inform VistA Fee Basis of what happened to the payments that were
     transmitted to Central Fee.  The option is used to tell the system
     which payments have been rejected.  The option is also used to
     complete a batch which changes its status to VOUCHERED and populates
     the DATE FINALIZED field in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT and FEE BASIS
     INVOICE files for applicable payments.  However, the current Finalize
     a Batch option does not have any direct impact on the payment process
     since that is managed by 994 code sheets.
  
     The Finalize a Batch option will be modified so users just specify any
     local rejects instead of identifying all rejects.  Payment lines that
     are rejected by Central Fee will be reported to VistA by the new
     interface transactions instead of being manually identified using the
     Finalize a Batch option.  The Finalize a Batch option will be modified
     to replace the use of the 994 code sheets, thereby making the 994 code
     sheet process totally obsolete. When a batch is completed with the
     Finalize a Batch option, a new transaction will be automatically
     transmitted to Central Fee.  This new transaction will list any
     payment lines that were locally rejected and instruct Central Fee to
     release the remainder of the batch for payment.  Central Fee will
     delete payment lines that were identified in this transaction as
     locally rejected. 
  
     The Finalize a Batch option should no longer be locked by security key
     FBAASUPERVISOR.  The installer must manually delete the lock from this
     option per installation step 13.
  
     Two new security keys are used to control access to functions within
     the Finalize a Batch option.  The FBAAREJECT key allows the holder
     to flag payment line items as locally rejected.  The FBAAFINANCE
     security key allows the holder to complete a batch.  These new keys
     must be assigned to applicable users per installation step 11.
  
     The Finalize a Batch option has been modified so only batches with a 
     status of CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED can be selected.
  
  3. MODIFY DELETE REJECT FLAG OPTION
  
     The Delete Reject Flag [FBAA VOUCHER DELETE REJECT] option is used to
     delete reject flags that were entered in error using the Finalize a
     Batch option.  Reject flags that are set by the new Central Fee
     transactions must not be locally deleted since those payment lines
     were not accepted by Central Fee or have been dropped from Central
     Fee.  Locally specified reject flags can only be deleted before the
     batch is completed (vouchered) since completion of the batch triggers
     the new transaction which results in the removal of any locally
     rejected payment lines from Central Fee and releases the remainder of
     the payment lines.
  
     The Delete Reject Flag option is no longer locked by security key 
     FBAASUPERVISOR.  It is instead locked by the new FBAAREJECT security
     key.
  
     The Delete Reject Flag option has been modified so only batches with a
     status of CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED can be selected.
  
  4. Automate Post Release Rejects
  
     A new interface transaction will be sent from Central Fee to VistA Fee
     Basis.  This transaction will list any rejects that occurred after 
     Central Fee was instructed to release the batch for payment.  The new 
     interface is intended to replace the current manual identification,
     using the Finalize a Batch option, of payment lines that were
     initially accepted by Central Fee and then later rejected.  This
     transaction will only be sent if rejects occur.
  
  5. Modify Print Rejected Payment Items Option
  
     The Print Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REJECT PRINT] option is used to
     print a list of payment items that have been flagged as rejected.  The
     option has been modified as follows:
  
     5A.  The report can be generated for batches with a status of
          CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED or VOUCHERED or both.
  
     5B.  The report will print Central Fee Reject for lines that were
          flagged as rejected by the interface.  It will print Local Reject
          for lines that were locally flagged as rejected by a user.
  
     5C.  The report will display reject codes and descriptions (maximum 
          of 5) for lines that were flagged as rejected by the interface.
  
  6. Modify Re-Initiate Rejected Payment Items Option
  
     The Re-Initiate Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REINITIATE REJECTS]
     option is used to re-initiate rejected payment items into a new open
     batch.
  
     The option has been modified to prevent selection of a batch when the
     application acknowledgement from Central Fee reported an application
     error or has not yet been received.  Central Fee generates an
     application acknowledgement in response to the new transaction sent by
     VistA when the batch is completed using the Finalize a Batch option.
  
  7. Modify Existing Options for New Batch Status
  
     A number of existing options used to edit invoices and payments 
     restrict what can be done to invoices and payments that are in batches
     which have a status of TRANSMITTED or VOUCHERED.  These options must
     be modified to apply the same restriction to a batch that has the new
     status value of CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED since the new status
     chronologically falls between the TRANSMITTED status and the VOUCHERED
     status. Additionally, batches with the new status should be treated as
     an active batch.
  
     7A. The following options have been modified to prevent selection of a
         batch that has a status of CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED.
           Invoice Edit [FBCH EDIT PAYMENT]    
           Edit CNH Payment [FBCNH EDIT PAYMENT]
           Edit Pharmacy Invoice [FBAA EDIT PHARMACY INVOICE]
           Delete Inpatient Invoice [FBCH DELETE INVOICE]
  
     7B. The following options have been modified to prevent selection of a
         batch that has a status of TRANSMITTED or CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED.
           Edit Payment [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
           Edit Ancillary Payment [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
     7C. The Active Batch Listing by Status [FBAA ACTIVE BATCH LISTING]
         option has been modified to include the new CENTRAL FEE ACCEPTED
         (F) status.
  
  8. Create New Option to Reprocess Overdue Batch
  
     This patch adds a new Reprocess Overdue Batch [FBAA REPROCESS BATCH]
     option. This option is used to reprocess a transmitted payment batch
     that was not received by Central Fee.  
   
     If VistA Fee Basis does not receive a Payment Batch Result message by 
     the third weekday after transmission of the Payment Batch message, the
     software will consider the result message as overdue.  A list of
     overdue batches can be obtained by entering a ? at the select batch
     prompt of this option.  
   
     The site should contact the National Service Desk Austin to determine
     if Central Fee contains the overdue batch. If so, the site should
     request that the Payment Batch Results message be resent to VistA.  If
     Central Fee does not have the batch, the site can use this option to
     either change the batch status so the batch will be resent or to
     reject the entire batch so the line items can be re-initiated into a
     new batch, edited, and then resent with the new batch.
  
  9. Create New Option to Resend Completed Batch
  
     This patch adds a new Resend Completed Batch [FBAA RESEND VOUCHER MSG]
     option. This option can be used to resend a Voucher Batch message to
     Central Fee.  
  
     If VistA Fee Basis does not receive a Voucher Batch Acknowledgement 
     message by the third weekday after finalization of the batch, the
     software will consider the acknowledgement message as overdue. A list
     of batches with an overdue acknowledgement can be obtained by entering
     a ? at the select batch prompt of this option.
  
     The site should contact the National Service Desk Austin to determine
     if Central Fee received the Voucher Batch message.  If Central Fee
     received the Voucher Batch message, the site should request that the
     Voucher Batch Acknowledgement message be resent to VistA.  If Central
     Fee did not receive the Voucher Batch message, the site can use the
     Resend Completed Batch option in VistA to generate a new Voucher Batch
     message and send that to Central Fee.
  
 10. New Payment Aging Report 
  
     This patch adds a new Payment Aging Report [FB PAYMENT AGING RPT] 
     option.  This option generates a report of payments that have been
     transmitted to Central Fee and are still awaiting payment confirmation
     or cancellation in VistA.  The purpose of the new report is to
     identify payments in VistA Fee Basis that appear to have a problem
     because payment confirmation has not been received within an expected
     period.  
   
     Payment line items finalized within a user-specified period will be 
     listed on this report if payment confirmation has not been received
     from Austin and the payment is not cancelled, flagged as rejected, or
     voided.
  
     Note: If the report is run for user-specified facilities instead of
     all facilities then any finalized payments with a blank value for the
     primary service facility are included in the results.
  
 11. Restrict Edit of Batch Status Field
  
     Several sites have edited the STATUS field of the FEE BASIS BATCH file
     using a VA FileMan option to assign an earlier status to a transmitted
     batch so the batch could be resent to Central Fee.  This action
     resulted in duplicate payments.
  
     This patch sets the WRITE ACCESS of the STATUS field to prevent users
     from changing the batch status using the FileMan Enter/Edit option.
  
 12. Modify ICN on Payment Batch
  
     This patch will make a minor modification to the content of the 
     payment batch message for batch type B3 (outpatient or ancillary) and
     batch type BT (travel).  If a payment line item has been moved by the
     patient merge process, the original internal entry numbers will be
     used to construct the ICN value that is sent to Central Fee.
  
     The purpose for this change is to ensure that the ICN value sent
     by the new Voucher Batch transaction for a given payment line item is
     consistent with the value previously sent for that line item by the
     Payment Batch transaction.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
  1. HD585796
   
     Problem:
     --------
     The Delete reject flag [FBAA VOUCHER DELETE REJECT] option double
     posts the amount paid to the 1358 when the reject flag is deleted
     from a selected travel payment line item.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The option has been corrected to just post the amount paid once.
  
  
  2. HD585831
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Re-initiate Rejected Payment Items [FBAA REINITIATE REJECTS] 
     option inappropriately updates the DATE FINALIZED (#13) and PERSON
     WHO COMPLETED (#14) fields of the old batch in the FEE BASIS BATCH
     (#161.7) file when a rejected line item is re-initiated into a new
     batch.
  
     Resolution:
     ----------- 
     The option has been corrected to stop updating inappropriate data
     fields for the old batch.
  
  
  3. HD585843
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Release a Batch [FBAA SUPERVISOR RELEASE] option creates a
     separate IFCAP authorization with an identical description for
     each inpatient invoice in the batch that is associated with an
     unauthorized claim.
  
     This may cause a problem if any inpatient invoices associated
     with an unauthorized claim are later flagged as rejected using
     the Finalize a Batch [FBAA FINALIZE BATCH] option.  The system
     attempts to post a credit amount to the 1358 obligation but the
     wrong IFCAP authorization may be credited resulting in the error 
     "Credit bill amount will exceed total bill amount".
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     The Release a Batch option will be modified to create a single IFCAP 
     authorization for all the inpatient invoices in the batch that are
     associated with unauthorized claims.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  An environmental check routine will verify that no entries in the FEE 
  BASIS BATCH (#161.7) file have a STATUS of TRANSMITTED.  In addition,
  the installer will be asked if the Chief Fiscal Officer has given 
  approval for installation of the patch.  These actions will only be
  performed in a production account.
  
  A pre-install routine will delete the existing traditional-style "AJ" 
  mumps cross-reference definition from the INVOICE NUMBER field in the FEE
  BASIS PAYMENT (#162) file. This cross-reference is being replaced by a
  new-style regular "AJ" cross-reference definition during the install. 
  
  A post-install routine will execute the set logic of the new "AN" 
  cross-reference for existing entries in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT MOVES 
  (#161.45) file.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the 
 following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their 
 descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running the 
 KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
   Fee Basis Main Menu [FBAA MAIN MENU]
    
 This patch should take less than 5 minutes to install.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 Ensure that all patches listed at the beginning of the patch description
 that are applicable to the site can be installed at the same time.
  
 The VistA Fee and IFCAP Automation Enhancement Implementation Procedure
 Guide referenced at the beginning of the patch description contains 
 information on preparing for and implementing this enhancement.
  
 If the patch is being installed in a production account, there must 
 not be any batches that have been transmitted to Central Fee and 
 are currently awaiting release by a 994 code sheet. The Chief 
 Financial Officer or a representative will verify this step and then 
 provide approval for the patch to be installed.
  
 a. There must not be any payment batches with a status of TRANSMITTED.  
    The environmental check routine will enforce this step.
  
 b. There must not be any pending payments in Central Fee that are awaiting
    release by an IFCAP 994 code sheet.  Central Fee report 12007 provides
    this information.  Normally finance staff have access to this report.
  
    Note: Central Fee will automatically drop all pending payments when
    a site implements the new process by installing this patch.  Central
    Fee will send a transaction to VistA for any dropped payments to flag
    the payment line items as rejected in VistA.  The site would then need
    to re-initiate and re-process these payments.
  
 c. The output from the Print Rejected Payment Line Items option should be
    reviewed for inappropriate reject flags.  Line items that have check
    confirmation data (check number, date paid) were released for payment
    by a 994 code sheet and therefore should not be flagged as rejected in
    VistA.
    
    Inappropriate reject flags must be deleted using the Delete Reject
    Flag option in Vista before the patch is installed because it will no 
    longer be possible to delete reject flags from a batch that has a
    status of VOUCHERED after the patch is installed.
    Note: The Delete Reject Flag option automatically posts the payment
    amount to the 1358 obligation.  Therefore, the software will not allow
    deletion of old inappropriate reject flags where the obligation is
    unavailable for posting or has been purged.
  
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #
     (FB*3.5*132):
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Has the Chief Fiscal Officer approved installation of 
     this patch' Answer either YES or NO as applicable.  A NO response
     will prevent installation of the patch.  Refer to the pre-installation
     instructions for more information.
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//' Answer NO unless your system does not do this in a
     nightly TaskMan process.
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' answer NO.
  
 8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' answer YES.
  
     When prompted 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of
     Order':'  Enter the following options:
        Fee Basis Main Menu [FBAA MAIN MENU]
  
     When prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
     Order':' press <return>.
  
 9.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
  
 10.  DELETE INSTALL ROUTINE FROM SYSTEM
     -----------------------------------
     (Optional) Delete the FBXIP132 install routine.
  
     Routine FBXIP132 contains the environmental check, pre-init, and
     post-init for the patch.  The environmental check verifies that
     no batches have a status of TRANSMITTED.  The pre-init deletes
     a traditional-style cross-reference definition that is being replaced
     by a new-style definition.  The post-init sets the new "AN" 
     cross-reference for existing entries in the FEE BASIS PAYMENT MOVES 
     (#161.45) file. Routine FBXIP132 can be deleted after a successful
     installation.
  
 11. ASSIGN NEW SECURITY KEYS TO APPROPRIATE USERS
     ---------------------------------------------
     Assign security key FBAAREJECT to users that should have the ability
     to flag payment line items as locally rejected within the Finalize a
     Batch option.
  
     Assign security key FBAAFINANCE to users that should have the ability
     to complete a batch and transmit the voucher batch message to Central
     Fee within the Finalize a Batch option.  Normally finance staff will
     perform this task.
  
 12. ADD APPROPRIATE MEMBERS TO THE NEW MAIL GROUP
     ---------------------------------------------
     (OPTIONAL) Add appropriate members to the new FEE FINANCE mail group.
  
     This mail group receives messages from the Fee Basis software when
     exceptions occur during processing of messages sent by Central Fee 
     that are related to payment batches previously transmitted to Central
     Fee.  
   
     This mail group was created for finance staff.  The messages sent to 
     this mail group are also sent to another mail group (FEE).  Since the
     FEE mail group also receives messages that may not be of interest to
     finance staff, the separate FEE FINANCE mail group was created.
   
     The FBAA BATCH SERVER, FBAA VOUCHER SERVER, and FBAA REJECT SERVER 
     options may send a message to this mail group.
  
 13. DELETE THE LOCK ON THE FINALIZE A BATCH OPTION
     ----------------------------------------------
     Delete the FBAASUPERVISOR security key from the LOCK field of
     the Finalize a Batch [FBAA FINALIZE BATCH] option.
  
     An example follows:
  
     Select Menu Management Option: EDIT options
     
     Select OPTION to edit: FBAA FINALIZE BATCH
     NAME: FBAA FINALIZE BATCH// 
     MENU TEXT: Finalize a Batch// 
     PACKAGE: 
     OUT OF ORDER MESSAGE: 
     LOCK: FBAASUPERVISOR// @
        SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? Y  (Yes)
     REVERSE/NEGATIVE LOCK: ^
  
     Select OPTION to edit:
