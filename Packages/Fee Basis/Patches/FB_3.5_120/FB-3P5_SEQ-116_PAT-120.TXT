  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  
  1) HD0000000554698 - Update RBRVS for CY2012
  
  Problem:
  ========
  The RBRVS Fee schedule needs to be updated for the calendar year 2012.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  This patch includes the data needed to calculate fee schedule amounts
  based on the RBRVS (also referred to as Medicare Physician Fee Schedule)
  for calendar year 2012.  The RBRVS fee schedule for future calendar years
  will be issued by a patch as they become available.
  
  The RBRVS fee schedule data is contained in four existing files. These
  files are all stored in global "^FB".  The four files are:
  
         FEE BASIS GEOGRAPHIC INDEX (#162.96) file
         FEE BASIS CPT RVU (#162.97) file
         FEE BASIS MODIFIER TABLE INDEX (#162.98) file
         FEE BASIS HCFA CONVERSION (#162.99) file
  
  The additional data added by this patch will increase the size of the
  FB global by approximately 5 MB.
  
  Installation of this patch will affect the menu options used to enter or
  edit payments for the Medical Fee program (outpatient) and ancillary
  payments for the Civil Hospital program.  The calendar year 2012 RBRVS
  fee schedule will be used for payments that have a date of service on or
  after January 1, 2012.  The RBRVS fee schedules for calendar years 
  beginning 1999 through 2011 will be retained in the VISTA database and
  will continue to be used for payments that have a date of service on or
  after September 1, 1999 and before January 1, 2012.
  
  The 2002 RBRVS fee schedule will be used for any payments entered prior
  to the installation of this patch that had a date of service on or before
  March 1, 2003.  Existing payments are NOT modified by this patch.  The
  fee schedule amount is only calculated when payments are entered or
  edited.
  
  The PLACE OF SERVICE (POS) code is used to determine if the facility or
  non-facility practice expense Relative Value Unit (RVU) should be used
  during RBRVS fee schedule calculations.  The list of codes considered
  facility and non-facility has not changed since 2011.  Here are the
  valid POS codes that are in effect.
  
        Codes considered as facility setting -
        05,06,07,08,21,22,23,24,26,31,34,41,42,51,52,53,56,61
  
        Codes considered as non-facility setting -
        01,03,04,09,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,25,32,33,49,50,54,
        55,57,60,62,65,71,72,81,99
  
  This patch also updates the modifier tables for CY2011 that contain
  modifier 62, the rate is updated to 63%.  
  
  The following five options are used to enter or edit payments for the
  Medical Fee (outpatient) program:
  
       Enter Payment                       [FBAA ENTER PAYMENT]
       Multiple Payment Entry              [FBAA MULTIPLE PAYMENT ENTRY]
       C&P/Multiple Patient Payment Entry  [FBAA C&P ENTER PAYMENT]
       Reimbursement Payment Entry         [FBAA MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT]
       Edit Payment                        [FBAA EDIT PAYMENT]
  
  The following four options are used to enter or edit ancillary payments
  for the Civil Hospital program:
  
       Ancillary Contract Hosp/CNH Payment  [FBCH ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
       Multiple Ancillary Payments          [FBCH MULTIPLE PAYMENTS]
       Patient Reimbursement for Ancillary  [FBCH ANCILLARY REIMBURSEMENT]
       Services
       Edit Ancillary Payment               [FBCH EDIT ANCILLARY PAYMENT]
  
  The following option is used to calculate a fee schedule amount
  without having to enter a payment:
  
       Calculate Payment Amount             [FBAA FEE SCHEDULE RATE]
  
  2) HD0000000602700 - RVU'S NOT CALCULATING
  
  Problem:
  ========
  CPT 37205, 37225 and 37227 are not calculating for CY2011.  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Correct RVU values for those CPT codes for CY2011.
