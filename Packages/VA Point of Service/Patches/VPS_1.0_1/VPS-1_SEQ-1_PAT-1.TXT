Subject: VA POINT OF SERVICE KIOSKS 1.0 RELEASE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 VHA has recently identified interactive kiosks as an innovation that will 
 enable VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) to enhance services to veterans and 
 improve the efficiency of operations. Many Veterans Integrated Service 
 Networks (VISNs) and VAMCs have already implemented kiosks in the past, 
 and are currently using them to provide streamlined approaches for 
 veterans to perform various tasks.  
  
 The VA's vision for the VETLINK VA Point of Service (VPS) kiosk is to 
 streamline and improve patient clinical and administrative processes 
 across the VA healthcare network and to provide standard, easy-to-use 
 capabilities for patients and employees to access and update information 
 and perform business transactions through incremental releases. The VA's 
 vision includes a modular and configurable solution that may be tailored 
 to fit each facility's individual needs. 
  
 The VETLINK VPS Kiosk Application Server uses the RPC BROKER to make calls 
 to the Remote Procedures (RPCs) residing on the VistA host. 
  
  
 Overview of items in the VPS package:
 =====================================
 New Option - VPS KIOSK INTERFACE    [VPS KIOSK INTERFACE]
 This broker type option contains the RPCs that support the VPS Kiosk
 system. The VETLINK VPS Kiosk system will call upon these RPCs for 
 specific events triggered by the kiosk machine accessed by a patient 
 (e.g., at check-in) or by VAMC staff. The following remote procedures
 are attached to this menu.
  
 New RPCs
 -------- 
 VPS GET PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC - This RPC will accept patient SSN as input
 then retrieve patient demographic data from VistA.
  
 VPS GET CLINIC - This RPC will accept a partial or full Clinic Name as
 input then retrieves Clinic IEN, Clinic Name, Clinic Physical Location
 from VistA based on the matching Clinic Name characters from the INPUT
 String.
  
 Pre-existing RPCs (already at sites)
 ------------------------------------
 XWB GET VARIABLE VALUE - This pre-existing RPC BROKER RPC accepts the name
 of a variable which will be evaluated and its value returned to the
 server. For example, this RPC may be called with a parameter like DUZ
 which will be returned as 123456. 
  
 ORWPT FULLSSN - This pre-existing OE/RR RPC accepts an SSN in the format
 999999999(P), and returns a list of matching patients.
  
 ORWPT LAST5 - This pre-existing OE/RR RPC returns a list of patients
 matching the string of Last Name Initial_Last 4 SSN (Initial/Last 4
 look-up to PATIENT file).
  
 ORWPT LIST ALL - This pre-existing OE/RR RPC returns a set of patient
 names for use with a long list box.

 2.  Create a CONNECT,VPS connector proxy account in the NEW PERSON file
 (#200) using the Foundations Management [XOBU SITE SETUP MENU].  
 Site IRM will need to take note of the ACCESS and VERIFY codes and keep 
 these codes in a place that can be later retrieved since these codes
 will need to be provided to the VPS point of contact in  order to 
 configure the VETLINK VPS Kiosk. 
  
 Here is a screen shot example:

      If this screen shows no running listener(s), it is likely that       
      the VistALink listener(s) for this system are managed by the       
      TCP/IP utility at the VMS system level and are already running.      
  
      The following TCP/IP command will show the status of all      
      listener services with names starting with vlink:             
                  $ tcpip show service vlink*                                    
      Please contact IRM site staff for additional information    
      regarding the VistALink listener(s) such as port number(s).
