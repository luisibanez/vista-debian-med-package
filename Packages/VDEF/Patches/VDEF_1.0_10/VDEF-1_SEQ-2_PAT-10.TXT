Subject: Delete Three VDEF Options

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix two issues.
 
 Issue 1
 =======
 Several times sites have inadvertently terminated, not just suspended,
 HL7 messages from going to the HDR.  That could result in the permanent
 loss of data to the HDR. To prevent that possibility, the following options
 are being deleted.  Although we do NOT foresee any scenario which requires
 these deleted options, their same purpose can be accomplished by using
 FileMan. Listed below are the options to be deleted, along with the FileMan 
 file & field that the option edited. 
 
 ***************************************************************************
 Sites should NOT edit these files without explicit  direction from Product
 Support. It is very unlikely that such a need will ever occur.
 
 There are instances where a site may need to temporarily suspend VDEF
 from generating HL7 messages.  That can be safely accomplished by using
 the option 'Suspend/Resume Request Queue' [VDEF Suspend/Run Request Queue].
 However, then VDEF processing should be resumed as soon as possible using
 the same option.
 ***************************************************************************
 
 
 
  Deleted Option:      'Activate/Inactivate Requestor' [VDEF Activate/Inac
                                                        Requestor]
  FileMan Alternative:  Edit the REQUESTOR ACTIVATION FLAG field (#.05) of
                        the VDEF REQUESTOR file (#579.1).
 
  Deleted Option:      'VDEF Event API Activate/Inactivate'   [VDEF Event API]
  FileMan Alternative:  Edit the API EVENT ACTIVE FLAG field (#.2) of the 
                        VDEF EVENT DESCRIPTION EVENT ID file (#577)
 
  Deleted Option:      'VDEF Custodial Package Activate/Inactivate'
                       [VDEF Custodial Package] 
  FileMan Alternative:  Edit the ACTIVATION STATUS field (#.02) of the 
                        VDEF CUSTODIAL PACKAGE file (#579.6)
 
  
 Issue 2
 =========
 The routine ^VDEFUTIL hard-coded VDEF MailMan alert messages to go to a
 specific addressee on Forum that is no longer valid.  That addressee is
 being deleted from the routine. The alert messages will continue to be
 routed to G.VDEF NATIONAL ALERTS@FORUM.VA.GOV.
 
 
 Test Sites:
 ===========
  North Texas HCS
  Tennessee Valley HCS
  Philadelphia VAMC
  Bay Pines VAMC
  Central Alabama HCS

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to remain on the system during the installation. 
       The installation will complete in less than four minutes.
 
   2.  The pre-installation routine, PRE^VDEFP10, will automatically stop
       all VDEF background processes. 
 
   3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   4.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <VDEF*1.0*10>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
   
 
    5.  On production systems only, the post-installation routine, POST^VDEFP10,
        will automatically restart the VDEF background processes. 
 
        OPTIONAL: The site may, at their discretion, start the VDEF background
        processes on their test system by entering the following
        command at the MUMPS prompt:      DO POST^VDEFP10
 
    6.  The routine VDEFP10 should NOT be deleted after installation.
