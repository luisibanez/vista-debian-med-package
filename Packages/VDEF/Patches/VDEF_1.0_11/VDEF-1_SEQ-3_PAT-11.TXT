Subject: FIX FOR ENDLESS MESSAGE RETRANSMISSIONS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  
 This patch will fix two issues.
  
 Issue 1
 =======
 There have been several instances of VDEF events remaining in a queued
 status on the out-going VDEF event queue even after transmission occurs,
 resulting in the same event being endlessly transmitted over and over 
 again to the HDR. 
 
 To prevent this from happening, the KILL logic of the "C" cross-reference
 of the REQUEST ENTRY STATUS field (#.02) of the QUEUE ENTRIES multiple
 (#579.31) of the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) is being modified to insure
 that HL7 events that are queued for transmission are removed from the queue
 once the event status is changed to PROCESSED. 
 
 Issue 2
 =========
 Product Support has recommended that all sites set the ARCHIVAL PARAMETER
 field (#.04) of the VDEF REQUEST QUEUE file (#579.3) to a minimum of 30 days
 for all the VDEF queues.  The recommendation was prompted by several
 instances where VDEF HL7 events needed to be recovered for re-transmission
 to the HDR.  Retaining the VDEF HL7 events for a minimum of 30 days before
 purging will allow that to be done with much less effort in the event of
 future cases.
 
 In order to insure compliance with this recommendation, the post-install
 routine will automatically reset the ARCHIVAL PARAMETER field (#.04)
 for all the VDEF REQUEST QEUEUE entries to 30 days. In addition, the input
 transform for the field has been modified to require a minimum of 30 days.   
 
 *IMPORTANT* 
 As a result, the VDEFHL7 global will grow as much as 260%, and should
 be monitored to insure that it has sufficient disk space allocated. 
 However, it will remain a relatively small global.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1.  Users are allowed to remain on the system during the installation. 
       The installation will complete in less than four minutes.
  
   2.  It is not necessary to stop VDEF background processes in order
       to install the patch. 
  
   3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   4.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you will be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <VDEF*1.0*11>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
   
  
    5.  The post-installation routine, POST^VDEFP11, will automatically increase
        the retention time for VDEF events to 30 days to prevent premature
        purging.  The post-install routine should not be deleted.
