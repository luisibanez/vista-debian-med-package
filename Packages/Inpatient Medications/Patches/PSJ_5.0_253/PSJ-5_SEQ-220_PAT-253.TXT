 This patch contains the following two defect fixes:
  
 1. This patch corrects an issue in Bar Code Medication Administration
    V. 3.0 in which orders do not display on the Virtual Due List (VDL) 
    if the order's Schedule Type is Continuous or Fill on Request, and 
    the order contains a Schedule defined in the Administration Schedule 
    File (#51.1) with a Schedule Type of On Call.
  
 2. This patch corrects an issue in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 in which
    changing a Non-Verified order's Schedule Type to On Call automatically
    changes the name of the order's Schedule to On Call without alerting 
    the user.

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 -----------------------------
 PSPO1765 - ON CALL, FILL on REQUEST doesn't show in BCMA. The VAMC 
 reported all Inpatient Medication orders with schedule type of Fill on 
 Request and a schedule of ON CALL appeared on the BCMA VDL, but not 
 orders with schedule type of Fill on Request and schedule of ON CALL 
 PREMED.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 HD415492 -  ON CALL, FILL on REQUEST doesn't show in BCMA
  
 Problem:
 -------
 An order with a SCHEDULE of "ON CALL" and a Schedule Type of Fill on 
 Request will appear in BCMA.  The problem is if a site as a SCHEDULE of 
 ON CALL(Pre-OP) or something similar where they have added onto the On 
 Call name in the .01 field in 51.1. If Pharmacy has made the order Fill 
 On Request, that is when it doesn't display in BCMA.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Inpatient Medications will send orders to BCMA as schedule type ON CALL 
 if the order contains a schedule that is defined in the Administration 
 Schedule File (#51.1) as type ON CALL, and the order itself has a 
 schedule type of Continuous or Fill on Request. If the order has a 
 schedule type of ONE TIME, PRN, or ON CALL, the order's schedule type 
 will always determine the type displayed in BCMA.
  
  
  
 HD414275 - Schedule is Automatically Converted if Schedule Type is On Call
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When a Non-Verified order's Schedule Type is changed to On Call during 
 Inpatient Order Entry, the name of the order's Schedule is automatically
 changed to "ON CALL", without alerting the user that the change has 
 occurred.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code performing the automatic change of an order's Schedule will be 
 removed. The fix for HD415492 in this patch removes the requirement for
 a Continuous or Fill on Request order's schedule to be equal to "ON CALL"
 for the order to display as an On Call order in BCMA.
