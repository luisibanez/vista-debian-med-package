 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000424107
  
   Problem:
   -------
   On the Orders tab of CPRS, if a lab test is ordered with a Collection
   Date/Time that has no explicit time indicated (e.g. "T" or "T+1"),
   and the "How Often?" field is set to a schedule with a frequency greater
   than 24 hours, the calculated Start Time of the order after signing it
   will be set to 16:80.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSJEEU so that the Start Time of the order is calculated
   to be NOW (current time) if the date is today (e.g. "T"), or midnight 
   (00:00) if the date is in the future (e.g. "T+1").
  
  
 2. HD0000000733738
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When running the Total Cost to Date (Current Patients) report [PSJU 
   TCTD], if a user chooses to sort by Clinic or Clinic Group, a <NOLINE> 
   error occurs.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routines PSGTCTD and PSGSEL to remove sort by Clinic or Clinic 
   Group.  Users may still sort by Ward Group, Ward, or Patient.
