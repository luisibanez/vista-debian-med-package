 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000245854 - Category "^Other" can't be retrieved
  
 Problem:
 -------
 This patch addresses the following inaccuracies in the Non-Verified/Pending 
 Orders report option [PSJU VBW].  When displaying results, the "^OTHER"
 ward group should contain all inpatient orders which are in a ward that
 do not belong to a ward group.  However, there are discrepancies between
 the number of orders that prints on the Order Summary screen and the
 number of patients displayed after a user chooses the parameters for the
 report.
  
 In the first scenario of this issue, patients with non-verified or pending 
 orders in a clinic were being included in "^OTHER" ward group in the patient 
 list.  This is incorrect since they had no ward.  This could cause 
 significantly more patients to appear on the patient list than there were 
 orders on the Order Summary screen.
  
 In the second scenario of this issue, orders which had a status of "Active" 
 but were not verified by a pharmacist were displaying on the Order Summary 
 screen for the ward group "^OTHER", but these patients were not being 
 displayed in the patient list when the user selected the ward group "^OTHER". 
 No other ward groups were affected by this problem.  This could cause 
 significantly fewer patients to display on the patient list than there 
 should have been.
  
 In the third scenario of this issue, IV orders with a schedule type of 
 "One-Time" were not being counted correctly on the Order Summary screen and 
 the Patient List.  This could cause patients with non-verified orders to not 
 show up on the report.
  
 Also, the help text concerning the "^OTHER" ward group is out of date and 
 does not coincide with current functionality or the most recent user 
 manual documentation.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routines PSGVBW, PSGVBW1, and PSGVBWU were modified so that orders in clinics 
 do not qualify a patient for the "^OTHER" ward group on the patient list and 
 that Active orders which have not been verified by a pharmacist still display 
 in the "^OTHER" ward group.  These modifications also include changes such
 that IV orders whose schedule type is "One-Time" are counted on the Order 
 Summary screen even though they are expired.
  
 Also, to reflect the current functionality of the Non-Verified/Pending 
 Orders report, the help text concerning the "^OTHER" ward group has been 
 changed so that it only mentions the inclusion of orders in wards which are 
 not associated with a ward group, and orders which are not in wards which 
 do not have clinics associated with them.
  
  
 2. HD0000000392288 - Warning for complex orders
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When entering a single-line complex order with a duration in CPRS, if the 
 order is then finished in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], the user
 receives a warning stating: "The following order contains a Requested
 Duration and may be part of a complex dose!  Review the entire profile to
 determine appropriate action(s)." However, the user will receive this
 warning twice in succession.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Removed the second error message by deleting the redundant code in routine 
 PSJOE0.
  
  
 3. HD0000000392879 - Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match warning
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When accepting an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] with 
 auto-verify turned on, if the user receives the "Dosage Ordered and
 Dispense Units do not match" warning, then the first line of the warning
 (""Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match") will be immediately
 scrolled off the screen and the user must scroll up to read it.  Only the
 second line of the warning ("Please verify Dosage") is visible.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changed code in PSGOEV to allow the screen to scroll down so that the
 entire warning can be read.
  
  
 4. HD0000000402743 - Error running Non-Verified/Pending Orders report
                      CNTORDRS+23^PSGVBWU
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When running the Order Summary section of the Non-Verified/Pending Orders 
 report [PSJU VBW], an error can occur which exits the user from the system. 
 Several calls to the tag CGNM^PSGVBWU were incorrectly written, causing an 
 error if accessed.  The error occurs when there is a non-verified Inpatient 
 order with "active" status which originally took place in a clinic, but the 
 patient is currently checked into a ward.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Changed the calls to CGNM^PSGVBWU so that they are no longer called as 
 functions, and will no longer cause an error.
