 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000212172 - Can delete dispense drug from active order even when 
                      dispensed
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], it is possible for a user to delete the
 Dispense Drug of an active order, despite a warning that "Dispense Drugs 
 for active orders cannot be deleted, but can be given an INACTIVE DATE."
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the attributes of the Data Dictionary for the INPATIENT USER 
 PARAMETERS file (#53.45), DISPENSE DRUG field (#.01), so that the 
 Dispense Drug of an active order can no longer be deleted.
  
  
 2. HD0000000394986 - Undefined error when Copy an IV order
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When copying an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], if the user opts 
 to discontinue the newly copied order before verifying it, he will receive
 an Undefined error.  This is because the system is attempting to reference
 an order which has not been created yet.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the routine PSJLIACT so that the correct order is discontinued if
 discontinuation occurs before the order is verified.
