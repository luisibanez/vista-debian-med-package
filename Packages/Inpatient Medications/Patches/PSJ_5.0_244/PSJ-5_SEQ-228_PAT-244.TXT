Subject: NON-VERIFIED ORDER CLEAN-UP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues:
  
 1. When executing the Non-Verified/Pending Orders report, there 
 appears to be a slow response time when searching for orders. 
  
 2. An incorrect error message is displaying when user initiates a new IV 
 order after entering a complex order.
  
 3. An Undefined error is occurring when initiating an unverified order 
 while the Unit Dose Clean-Up [PSJU BRJ] job is running.
 Additionally, this patch will correct the XINDEX errors occurring in
 routines, PSGBRJ and PSIVORE2.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW: 
 ================
 1. HD0000000398874 - 6 SBY - Slow response when searching for orders
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the Non-Verified/Pending Orders report [PSJU VBW] and 
 displaying an Order Summary, the report would often take several minutes
 to run.  This is because the cross-references which contains 
 non-verified orders is growing too large, since there is no existing
 mechanism for removing discontinued orders from the cross-reference.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Introduced a new tag in the Unit Dose Clean-Up option [PSJU BRJ] which 
 will remove discontinued orders from the cross-references which contains
 "orders not verified by a nurse" and "orders verified by a nurse but not a
 pharmacist" ("ANV, "APV", "ANIV", and "APIV").
  
  
 2. HD0000000412242 - 5 Incorrect Error Message Displaying.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem occurs after a user has created a complex order in CPRS and 
 verified it using Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE].  The order has a 
 schedule type of FILL on Request during the verification process.
 Afterwards, if the user enters a new IV order, the user will 
 inadvertently receive error message during IV order entry at several
 points stating:
 "This is a Complex Order. [This field] may not be edited at this point"
 despite the fact that the new order is not complex.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed routine PSIVORE2 so that Inpatient Order Entry no longer looks 
 at the old complex order to deliver the warning message.
  
  
 3. HD0000000403045 - UNDEF ERROR
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users can receive an Undefined Error when working on an unverified order
 during the Unit Dose Clean-Up nightly background job [PSJU BRJ].  It is
 possible for the Unit Dose Clean-Up to delete the Non-Verified Order that 
 a user is working on before the process is completed.  This will cause an
 error when trying to exit the order.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the routine PSGBRJ so that the Unit Dose Clean-Up will not delete 
 a Non-Verified Order if there is a lock on the corresponding CPRS order.
