============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Inpatient Medications

    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] to prevent an IV order from CPRS from 
    being finished as a Piggyback if it includes a Bottle value.
  
 2. During Allergy checks in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], it is 
    possible to get an Undefined error.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000518275 - IV ADDITIVE FREQUENCY FIELD
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2097
  
    Problem:
    -------
    The Inpatient Medications Workgroup has requested a new check in 
    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] to prevent an IV order from CPRS from 
    being finished as a Piggyback if it includes a Bottle value.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed PSIVORC1 so that the user will be presented with a new prompt 
    asking them if they would like to delete the bottle value(s).  If the 
    user replies "No", they will be prompted to choose a different IV Type.
  
    NOTE: If a user replies "Yes", the bottle value(s) will be immediately 
    deleted and will not be automatically restored if a user exits out of 
    the order before verifying it.  However, the bottle value can always be
    manually re-entered if the IV Type is changed to a type which supports 
    bottle values.
  
  
 2. HD0000000540868 - cannot finish order
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #2141
  
    Problem:
    -------
    During the Allergy checks process in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], 
    a message is received from the Health Data Repository (HDR) to
    determine Drug-Allergy Reactions.  If a Drug Class is received from
    HDR which is not listed in the VA DRUG CLASS file (#50.605), this will
    cause an <UNDEFINED> error.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed PSJGMRA so that the <UNDEFINED> error does not occur, and a 
    warning message informs the user of the invalid Drug Class.
  
 WARNING: The following drug classes do not exist in the VA DRUG CLASS file
          (#50.605).  Please do a manual Drug-Allergy order check and 
          notify the pharmacy ADPAC for follow-up.
  
 VA Drug Class: [Drug Class]
