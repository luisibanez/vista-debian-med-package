 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000507571 - Patch PSJ*5*216 question about item #1
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When an active Unit Dose order is edited to change the Dispense Drug
   and the Units/Dose, and the value for Units/Dose is a fraction, even
   though the new Dosage Ordered equals the original Dosage Ordered, the
   user is incorrectly presented with a warning message:
  
     "WARNING: Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match."
          Please verify Dosage.
  
   This warning message should only display when an active Unit Dose order
   is edited to change the Dispense Drug and the Units/Dose and the new
   Dosage Ordered does NOT equal the original Dosage Ordered.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified routine PSJDOSE so that Dosage Ordered is correctly compared to
   Dispense Drug dose times Units per Dose to determine whether an error 
   message should be displayed.
  
   NOTE:
   -----
   It should be noted that when dealing with certain fractions or decimals 
   which are relatively close to each other (e.g. one-eighth and 
   one-ninth), these will be rounded to values which the system deems 
   sufficiently close to each other, and the warning message will not
   display.
  
  
 2. HD0000000491412 - System prompts erroneous warning regarding  
                      overlapping admin times
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When a user enters a Complex Unit Dose order with different day-of-the-
   week schedules but the same Administration times, the system will
   erroneously display the warning message, "The highlighted admin times
   for these portions of this complex order overlap".
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modified routine PSGOEF2 so that the warning message will only display
   for day-of-the-week schedules with portions which have the same 
   admin times on the same days.
