    the Dispense Drugs of existing orders.
  
 2. Reinstated orders which are active display a status of "DA" indicating
    discontinued.

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. HD0000000594816:
  
    Problem:
    -------
    If a nurse in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] does not have the PSJ 
    RNFINISH security key and the Inpatient User Parameter "MAY SELECT 
    DISPENSE DRUGS" is set to "NO", then a nurse should not be authorized
    to select Dispense Drugs.  However, a nurse without either of these
    authorizations may still edit Dispense Drugs on existing orders, which
    is not intended.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routines PSGOE82 and PSGOE92 so that a nurse without the PSJ
    RNFINISH key and whose Inpatient User Parameter "MAY SELECT DISPENSE
    DRUGS" is set to "NO", will now receive an error message upon trying to
    edit a Dispense Drug reading, "You are not authorized to edit Dispense
    Drugs".
  
  
 2. HD0000000535987:
  
    Problem:
    -------
    In some instances, if a patient is admitted to an observation ward 
    with an observation treating specialty and subsequently discharged, the
    user will be prompted with the question, "Will the patient be
    re-admitted immediately?"  If the user answers YES and then re-admits
    the patient, all Inpatient orders which were auto-discontinued upon
    discharge will be re-instated.  However, their Display Status in
    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] will still show them with a status of
    "DA", indicating discontinued due to patient movement.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Modified routine PSJOERI so that Display Status is properly updated
    upon re-instatement, and all re-instated orders appear active again.
