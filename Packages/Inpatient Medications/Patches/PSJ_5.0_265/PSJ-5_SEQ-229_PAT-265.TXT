    PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES:
    =====================
    PSPO #471
  
  
   Problem:
   -------
   This patch fixes an issue with the Non-Verified/Pending Orders report 
   [PSJU VBW] option, in which a pending order at a clinic would sometimes
   not be visible if the patient had two pending orders at two different
   clinics. 
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSGVBW so that pending clinic orders display properly on
   the Non-Verified/Pending Orders report.
  
  
 2. HD0000000155005 - NON-VERIFIED ORDER NOT ACCESSIBLE FROM OUTPATIENT
                      CLINIC
  
   Problem:
   -------
   Related to issue #1, this patch fixes an issue with the
   Non-Verified/Pending Orders report [PSJU VBW] option in which a
   non-verified order at a clinic would not be visible.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSGAXR so that future non-verified orders display
   properly on the Non-Verified/Pending Orders report, and included
   post-install routine PSJ50265 to make pre-existing non-verified orders 
   display properly on the report.
  
  
 3. HD0000000517919 - BACKDOOR EDIT LOOP
  
   Problem:
   -------
   This patch corrects an error with the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] 
   option, in which attempting to edit the STOP DATE/TIME for an active
   order, and then using "^" fails to cancel out of the edit.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSGOE91 so that using "^" will allow the user to cancel 
   out of the edit.
