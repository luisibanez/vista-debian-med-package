Subject: MEDICATION ORDER CHECK HEALTHCARE APPLICATION v1.0

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the new Medication 
 Order Check Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  These patches will 
 replace most of the current VistA medication order checking system with 
 version 1.0 of the new Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA) system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) Drug Information 
 Framework (DIF) interfaces and database. The VistA Drug Interaction module
 will be replaced by the FDB Drug-Drug Interaction Module (DDIM). The VistA
 Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the FDB Enhanced Therapeutic
 Classification (ETC) System. In addition, the following three order checks
 that use VistA data have been added to Inpatient Medications and
 Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks currently occur in Computerized Patient
 Record System (CPRS), but will be new to Pharmacy with the installation of
 these patches:
  
         Aminoglycoside Ordered
         Dangerous Meds for Patients > 64
         Glucophage - Lab Results
   
 A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced 
 called Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only 
 by members of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM).  It will allow the NDF 
 Support Group to customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
  
 The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
 this release:
  
         Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
         Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
         Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check 
         display and processing (PSI-07-080)
  
 Please refer to the MOCHA v1.0 Release Notes for additional information.
   
 MOCHA v1.0 consists of two host files: PSS_1_136.zip, 
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID, and two patches PSS*1*117 and PSO*7*375.  
 These  files and patches contain software that support MOCHA v1.0 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for MOCHA v1.0.  To see current 
 status and target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the 
 following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx 
  
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and 
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team.  Installation 
 information for MOCHA v1.0 is included in the VistA to MOCHA v1.0 
 Interface Installation Guide and the MOCHA v1.0 Combined Build 
 Installation Guide.  
  
  
 Patch Information:
 ------------------
  
 PSS_1_136.zip includes the components necessary for the interface that
 will be used in MOCHA v1.0:  
  
 PRE_I_3_INTERFACE_BUILD.KID (contains PSS*1*136)
  
 PSSPRE_1_0.XML     
  
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID includes the following required patches 
 to enable the MOCHA v1.0 functionality:
  
         PSO*7*251
         PSJ*5*181
         OR*3*272
  
 These patches will be distributed as standalone patches via FORUM and 
 will support MOCHA v1.0:
  
         PSS*1*117
         PSO*7*375
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the phased
 implementation.  During each implementation phase, the Implementation Team
 will provide each site the instructions and location to obtain the
 software.
  
  
 Please refer to the documentation referenced below for more information.
  
  
 ******************************* WARNING **********************************
  
 If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface from ILC this 
 patch will overwrite any "local" modifications in routines PSGOEE and
 PSJCOMR. This could affect certain orders being sent across
 this interface.  The modifications will have to be reintroduced following
 installation of this patch.
  
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 If a patient has a non-VA med order without a dosage specified, the order
 check process will loop through each of the dispense drugs tied to the
 Pharmacy Orderable Item.  This causes multiple warning messages to display
 for the same order.  This patch calls ^PSODDPR4 routine, a new application
 programming interface (API), that will use the first active dispense drug
 found for the Pharmacy Orderable Item in the order checks.  The following
 tickets are addressed with this fix:
 HD0000000130974
 HD0000000143776  
 HD0000000144157  
 HD0000000170500 
 HD0000000213650  
 HD0000000295220 
 HD0000000188980 
  
 When a pending unit dose order was selected for finishing, only part
 of the CPRS order checks narrative was displayed. HD0000000313339
  
 This patch will include entries marked for premixes in the IV SOLUTIONS 
 File (#52.7) in the order checks. PSI-06-012, HD0000000067588, 
 HD0000000128116
  
 The display of the order checks and allergy information is causing 
 confusion to the user when prompting to log an intervention.  It was not 
 clear which warnings the intervention is being logged for.  This patch
 is changing the display for the order checks and allergy warnings.
 PSI-07-080(HD0000000188098).  
  
 When the additive field is edited on a pending order during the finishing 
 process, a new order is not created.  This patch will create a new order 
 for this situation.  HD0000000307136
