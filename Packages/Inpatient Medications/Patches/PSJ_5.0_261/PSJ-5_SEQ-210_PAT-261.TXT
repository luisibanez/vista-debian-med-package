Subject: DEFAULT STOP DATE FOR IV PENDING ORDERS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Incorrect Stop Dates can be created when finishing orders in the Inpatient
 Medications package for the following scenarios:
  
 1. For an order that has an orderable item defined with multiple IV 
 Additives, the finish process may not calculate the stop date correctly.  
 The system defaults to the IV ROOM number of days defined for the IV type.
 However, the system should default to the smallest value of all
 occurrences of the following within the order: the IV ROOM number of days 
 defined for the IV type from the IV ROOM file (#59.5), the DAY (nD) or
 DOSE (nL) LIMIT field (#.05) from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
 (#50.7), or the "NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER" field (#3) from the IV
 ADDITIVES (#52.6) file.
  
 2. For an order that has an orderable item defined with a single IV 
 Additive and that IV Additive has quick codes defined, the stop date does 
 not calculate correctly. The system should default to the smallest value
 of all occurrences of the following within the order: the IV ROOM number 
 of days defined for the IV type from the IV ROOM file (#59.5), the DAY
 (nD) or DOSE (nL) LIMIT field (#.05) from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
 (#50.7), or the "NUMBER OF DAYS FOR IV ORDER" field (#3) from the IV
 ADDITIVES (#52.6) file.
  
 3. For an order that has an orderable item defined with multiple IV 
 Solutions (PreMix), the finish process may not calculate the stop date 
 correctly.  The system defaults to the IV ROOM number of days defined for 
 the IV type. However, the system should default to the smallest value of 
 all occurrences of the following within the order: the IV ROOM number of
 days defined for the IV type from the IV ROOM file (#59.5) or the DAY (nD)
 or DOSE (nL) LIMIT field (#.05) from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file
 (#50.7).
  
 Another issue introduced by MOCHA 1.0 is when the user finishes the order
 without initially entering the IV Additive and then goes back and edits
 the order during finish to add the IV Additive. In this case, the stop
 date may not be calculated correctly. This will be corrected in a future
 patch.
  
 Note that there is an existing issue when editing an active/non-verified
 order where the stop date may not calculate correctly. Because of this 
 issue and other edit issues that currently exist, it is recommended that
 the stop date calculation should be monitored closely when using the edit
 function.

 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs):
 =============================
 PSPO00002040 - Stop dates for medications are longer than is needed so 
 patients may receive more of the medication than is appropriate. We know 
 of at least 4 patients whose stop dates are incorrect from yesterday.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================
 1. HD0000000490875 - MOCHA ISSUE - IV STOP DATES
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The default stop date was not calculated correctly when finishing IV 
 orders.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified the routines to calculate the stop date correctly after IV
 Additives and IV Solutions (PreMix) have been entered.
  
                                        
 Implementation/Installation:
 ============================
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and 
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team.
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the 
 phased implementation.  During each implementation phase, the 
 Implementation Team will provide each site the instructions and location 
 to obtain the software.

 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should not be installed while Inpatient Medication options are 
 in use. It is also recommended that it be installed when Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS) usage is at a minimum, particularly for
 Inpatient Medication ordering. This patch should take less than 5 minutes
 to install.
  
    1. Download MOCHA_1_0_PSJ_5_261.KID into your local directory.
  
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
       select the Installation menu.
  
    3. Select the Load a Distribution and enter the directory that you
       FTP'ed the host file to and MOCHA_1_0_PSJ_5_261.KID.  Example:
       USER$:[ABC]MOCHA_1_0_PSJ_5_261.KID
  
    4. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
       you may select to use the following options (when prompted for
       INSTALL NAME, enter PSJ*5.0*261):
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as Data Dictionaries or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
      d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
   5. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSJ*5.0*261.
  
   6. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//"
      respond NO.
  
   7. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
