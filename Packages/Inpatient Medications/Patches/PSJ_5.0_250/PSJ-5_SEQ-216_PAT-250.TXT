Subject: INVALID BARCODE WHEN IVPB ORDER CHANGED

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects an issue in which it is possible to reprint an old 
 label for an IVPB order after the Solution or Volume has been changed.  
 If a user prints a label for an IVPB order, then changes the Solution 
 (or Volume) in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], then goes to Individual
 Labels (IV) [PSJI LBLI], it is possible to reprint the original label 
 even though it now has the incorrect Solution (or Volume) on it.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000124912 - Invalid barcode when IVPB order changed
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   ---------------------
   PSPO #256
  
   Problem:
   -------
   If a user prints a label for an IVPB order, then changes the Solution in
   Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], then goes to Individual Labels (IV)
   [PSJI LBLI], it is possible to reprint the original label even though it
   now has the incorrect solution on it.  The same problem exists if the 
   Volume is changed.
  
   Resolution:
   ------------
   Modified routine PSIVLBRP to prevent the re-printing of a label with
   inaccurate Solution (or Volume) data and added the message, "Solution on
   label [label #] does not match current order."
