Subject: CORRECT LABEL PRINTING ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 4 issues in the Inpatient Medications 
 package:
  
 1. Comments in the "Other Print Info" field of an IV label are getting 
    cut off after 42 characters.
  
 2. Option PSJU SFEA points to a tag that no longer exists, causing a hard 
    crash if it is selected.
  
 3. When editing an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], when prompted
    "Select Item(s)", entering a response of "12,2" (to edit the Dispense
    Drug field and then the Dosage field) would lead to an infinite loop.
  
 4. When renewing an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], the "Expected
    First Dose" is calculated counting forward from the expected start date
    instead of the original start date of the order being renewed.

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============
 1. HD0000000385700:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When printing pharmacy IV labels in CPRS, with a "Other Print Info" field 
 containing more than 42 characters, the Other Print Info is getting cut
 off. This problem was not seen when printing labels from the VistA option
 PSJU LABEL [Label Print/Reprint].
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed routine PSJORMA2 so that the system prevents the last word from 
 being cut off when "Other Print Info" exceeds 42 characters.
  
  
 2. HD0000000361730:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Option PSJU SFEA points to a tag that no longer exists, causing a hard 
 crash if it is selected.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Removed option PSJU SFEA from available options.
  
  
 3. HD0000000375104:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When editing an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] and prompted
 "Select Item(s)", entering a response of "12,2" (to edit the Dispense Drug
 field and then the Dosage field) would lead to an infinite loop.
 No other combination would result in this issue (not even "2,12").
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed routine PSGOE92 so that entering "12,2" does not cause an infinite
 loop.
  
  
 4. HD0000000168649:
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When renewing an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], the "Expected 
 First Dose" is calculated counting forward from the expected start date
 instead of the original start date of the order being renewed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed routine PSJORP2 so that the date calculation for the "Expected
 First Dose" begins at the original start date of the order being renewed,
 and preserves the same frequency between doses.
