Description:
============

 ****************************** Note **************************************
  
 This patch is a follow-up defect patch for Medication Order Check 
 Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  The MOCHA v1.0 patches are being 
 released as a phased implementation release.  To see current status and 
 target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites should have received instructions and guidance on the installation 
 of MOCHA v1.0 as it is a phased implementation. Patches PSO*7*387,
 PSJ*5*263, PSS*1*163 and OR*3*346 need to be installed within 2 business
 days at all sites that have MOCHA v1.0 installed in production.  The
 remaining sites need to install the patches included with this release
 immediately after the installation of the MOCHA v1.0 patches.  These
 patches may be installed in any order after the MOCHA v1.0 patches are
 installed.  (The MOCHA v1.0 installation included patches PSS*1*136,
 PSO*7*251, PSJ*5*181, OR*3*272, PSS*1*117, PSO*7*375)  
  
 **************************************************************************
  
  
 1. When the provider placed an IV order on hold, the code "HP" was 
 displayed for the order on the Inpatient Meds profile.  "HP" was still 
 displayed on the patient profile on the pharmacy side when the provider 
 released the order from hold.  The order status was correctly changed 
 back to active.   Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) was working 
 with an active order even though the display code was indicating hold by 
 provider.  This patch is removing the "HP" so the appropriate status is 
 displaying on the profile. HD0000000503309 (Code Change Request (CCR) 
 #4466)
  
 2. When no active dispense drug was found for an active unit dose order, 
 the order was not included in the Drug Interaction and Duplicate 
 Therapeutic checks for Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).  This 
 patch will ensure a dispense drug is included for the order checks.  (CCR 
 #4465)
  
 3. An undefined error occurred when using an order set with more than one 
 order.  This happened when one of the orders was edited and the variable 
 PSJNOO was killed.  This lead to an undefined when continued entering a 
 subsequence order from the order set. HD0000000505659 (CCR #4503)
  
 4. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Workgroup and Patient 
 Safety requested Inpatient Medications shows the bottle/bag number in 
 parenthesis on the finishing screen for an IV order.  This change will 
 display the bottle number within the parenthesis for IV orders on the 
 profiles and the order view. (Change Request (CR) #2535, CCR #3815)
  
 5. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Workgroup and Patient 
 Safety requested Inpatient Medications show the 'See Comments' next to 
 the IV additive name if applicable on the finishing screen for an IV 
 order.  This change will display 'See Comment' within the parenthesis for 
 IV orders on the profiles and the order view.  The user must enter the 
 appropriate bottle/bag number before completing the order. (CR #2534, CCR 
 #2990)
  
 6. This patch also fixes an issue in the IV Profile where additive data 
 is not wrapped appropriately.
  
 7. When a provider edits the IVPB type order in CPRS, the IV TYPE is set 
 as Admixture and that caused the Stop date to calculate incorrectly.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ============================
 1. HD0000000503309 - Incorrect med order status displaying on Inpatient 
 med profile
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The "HP" display code was not removed on the Inpatient Medication side 
 after the provider released the order from hold.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified ^PSJHL6 to remove "HP" from displaying on the patient profile.
                                                                                 
                         
 2. HD0000000505659 - <UNDEFINED>PSGOETO+25^PSGOETO *PSJNOO
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Variable PSJNOO was killed after one of the orders in the order set 
 was edited.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified ^PSGOES to reset PSJNOO if this variable is not defined.
  
 3. HD0000000281238 (CCR4143) - Incorrect IV Type when provider edited a 
 pending IV piggy back order
         
 Problem:
 --------
 If a signed IV order is edited to change the duration. Upon finishing the 
 order, before it is accepted, the IV Limit is dropped and the stop date 
 is not calculated correctly. The system is storing Piggyback type orders 
 as Admixture type orders when they are edited through CPRS. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine PSJHL4A has been modified to prevent the type from changing to 
 admixture if this is an edit of a new order.
