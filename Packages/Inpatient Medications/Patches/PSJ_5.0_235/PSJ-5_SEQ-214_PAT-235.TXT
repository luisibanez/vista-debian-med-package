Associated patches: (v)PSJ*5*113   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSJ*5*235'

Subject: EXPECTED FIRST DOSE IS INCORRECT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 2 issues:
  
 1. The Expected First Dose line in CPRS, as well as the REQUESTED START
    DATE line in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] are not displaying the
    correct date.
  
 2. When a complex Unit Dose order is entered in CPRS, and the complex 
    order uses a THEN conjunction, and the Administration time of the first
    section of the order is before the current time, the Administration 
    time for the subsequent section(s) is incorrect.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:

 1. HD0000000349678 - QOD (every other day) schedule not working
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1521
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When calculating the Expected First Dose, CPRS is ignoring the 
    Inpatient Ward parameter DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION and is
    defaulting the calculation for the first dose of the order to be based
    on USE NEXT ADMIN TIME AS DEFAULT.  Depending on the Administration
    Schedule used and for Wards with this Parameter set to either USE NOW
    AS DEFAULT or USE CLOSEST AS DEFAULT, the Expected First Dose in CPRS 
    and the Requested Start date in Inpatient Order Entry (PSJ OE) can be
    incorrect and not match the actual Due date shown in the BCMA Virtual
    Due List.
  
  
    Example:
  
    If it is currently 10 am and you are creating an order with an 
    Administration time of 9 am on a schedule of EVERY OTHER MORNING, and
    since Today's dose has passed, the Expected Next Dose should show as
    the day-after-tomorrow at 9 am, where it is currently showing as
    Tomorrow at 9 am.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------- 
    Routine PSJORPOE has been modified so that CPRS will calculate the 
    Expected First Dose based on the actual selected Inpatient Ward 
    parameter DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION and not always base the 
    calculation on USE NEXT ADMIN TIME AS DEFAULT.
  
    NOTE:
    -----
    This is not a defect but is in fact the way the system was designed.
    Making this change therefore necessitates an update to the Inpatient
    Medications Nurse's User Manual and Pharmacist's Manual to reflect 
    this change.
  
  
 2. HD0000000282528 - Complex Order using conjunction of THEN skips the
                      first dose of the second part when the first part has
                      a duration of 1 day.
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1136
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The system currently calculates the start time of each section of a 
    complex order independently and the calculations are erroneously based
    on NOW. This is causing the subsequent sections in a complex order to
    have an incorrect start time.
  
  
    Example:
    
    If it is 1000 and the second part of a complex order using the THEN
    conjunction has Administration times of 0900 and 1700, this order would
    start on that day at 1700 because 0900 today has already passed. This
    is incorrect.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine PSJORPOE has been modified so that tag STARTSTP now accepts 
    another parameter and allows the start date calculation to be based on
    an initial date. Previously all calculations were based on NOW. After
    this correction, calculations will be based on the date/time passed
    in.
  
    **NOTE** 
    This change modifies Integration Agreement #3167
