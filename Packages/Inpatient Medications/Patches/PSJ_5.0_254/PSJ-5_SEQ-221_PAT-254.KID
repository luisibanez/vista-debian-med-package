 "STRENGTH" is the amount of an additive to be used in the manufacturing
"^DD",53.1,53.157,1,21,2,0)
of the IV order. NOTE! You will be expected to use the strength units that
"^DD",53.1,53.157,1,21,3,0)
were previously defined within the IV ADDITIVE file (52.6) for each 
"^DD",53.1,53.157,1,21,4,0)
additive. For example, if the DRUG UNITS field of the IV ADDITIVES file 
"^DD",53.1,53.157,1,21,5,0)

"^DD",53.1,53.157,1,21,6,0)
to enter 500 for a half-gram dose. Enter 0.5 instead.
