 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000464717 - Renewing IV order bombs
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user creates a new IV order in Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER]
    without first viewing the patient profile, then immediately renews
    the order without exiting Order Entry (IV), an undefined error will
    occur during renewal.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the routine PSIVOPT2 so that the variable PSGDT is always set, 
    ensuring that the error will not occur.
  
  
 2. HD0000000343009 - Pre-exchange report not printing when orders are
                      renewed
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Speed Renew (RN) function of PSJU NE (Order Entry,) if 
    there are pre-exchange doses, the system will prompt the user for the 
    output device to print the pre-exchange report.  However, because the 
    variable which holds the pre-exchange dose data gets reset by the exit 
    logic of PSJU LM SPEED RENEW protocol, the report does not get printed.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the routine PSJHVARS to not reset the variable until after the
    pre-exchange report is printed.
  
  
 3. HD0000000427446 - Can't copy an IV order
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], when a user selects an existing or
    newly-copied order, chooses the Edit option, and then presses Enter
    without typing a selection, they will be unable to Accept and will be
    stuck in an endless loop of prompts.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Removed all references to the variable PSJEDFLG from the routines 
    PSIVOPT1 and PSIVORFE.  This will prevent the loop from occurring.
  
  
 4. HD0000000284893 - SYNTAX ERROR LD1+6 DDIOL
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When renewing multiple unit dose orders through the Inpatient Order
    Entry [PSJ OE] menu option, if the patient has an allergy related to
    one of the orders being renewed, a <SYNTAX> error will result. This is 
    the result of some variables being 'killed' instead of 'newed'.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    All variables in tag UPDREN^PSIVOPT2 are being newed instead of killed.
