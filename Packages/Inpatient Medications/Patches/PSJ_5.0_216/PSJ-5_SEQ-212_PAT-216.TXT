Subject:  WARNING MESSAGE DISPLAYED WHEN DOSAGE ORDERED DID NOT CHANGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following 2 issues in the Inpatient 
 Medications package:
  
 1.  When an active Unit Dose order is edited to change the Dispense Drug
     and the Units/Dose, and even though the new Dosage Ordered equals the
     original Dosage Ordered, the user is incorrectly presented with a
     warning message:
  
     "WARNING: Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match."
          Please verify Dosage.
  
     
     This warning message should only display when an active Unit Dose
     order is edited to change the Dispense Drug and the Units/Dose and the
     new Dosage Ordered does NOT equal the original Dosage Ordered. Also,
     field 2 (Dosage Ordered) and field 12 (Dispense Drug) should display
     in reverse video.
  
  
 2.  When a user is prompted for dosage in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
     OE], a response of null will no longer be allowed.

    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #526
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an active Unit Dose order is edited to change the Dispense Drug
    and the Units/Dose, and even though the new Dosage Ordered equals the
    original Dosage Ordered, the user is incorrectly presented with a
    warning message:
  
     "WARNING: Dosage Ordered and Dispense Units do not match."
          Please verify Dosage.
  
  
    This warning message should only display when an active Unit Dose
    order is edited to change the Dispense Drug and the Units/Dose and the
    new Dosage Ordered does NOT equal the original Dosage Ordered. Also,
    field 2 (Dosage Ordered) and field 12 (Dispense Drug) should display in
    reverse video.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine PSJDOSE to display the warning message only when the
    Dispense Drug(s) times (X) the Unit/Dose is NOT equal to the Dosage
    Ordered.  Only active Dispense Drugs will be included in the 
    calculations.  Also, when the warning message displays, the Dosage 
    Ordered and Dispense Drug items will display in reverse video.
  
    Note:
    -----
    The second item in the Remedy ticket, to update the activity log when 
    this type of change is made, was addressed by the development team
    in patch PSJ*5.0*215, released 10/26/2009.
  
   
 2. HD0000000426054 - NULL DOSAGE ORDERED.
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1839
  
    Problem:
    -------
    Users can edit an order in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] and enter a
    null value for Dosage Ordered, causing a problem with the BCMA display
    for that order.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed routine PSJDOSE so that a null value for Dosage Ordered is no 
    longer allowed in Inpatient Order Entry.
