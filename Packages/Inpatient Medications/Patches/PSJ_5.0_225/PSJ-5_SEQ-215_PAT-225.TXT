Subject: PRN ORDERS WITH 1440 FREQ, IVP NOT ON WORKSHEET, ORDERS NOT ON CPRS MEDS TAB

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1. Inpatient Pharmacy documentation states that Units Per Dose, if entered
    as 0, should be interpreted as 1. This is not what is actually
    happening.
 2. PRN (as needed) orders coming from CPRS are having their frequency 
    incorrectly default to 1440 (once per day) in certain circumstances.
 3. Intravenous Push (IVP) orders are not showing up on the medications 
    due worksheet.
 4. The CPRS Meds tab is filtering out active orders that have been held 
    when the sort type is by Drug (Alphabetical)
 5. The ORCH CONTEXT MEDS parameter is not being correctly utilized on 
    the CPRS Meds tab, causing orders to incorrectly display.

 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================= 
 1. HD0000000359919 - IP finishing allows units per dose of "zero".
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   ---------------------
   PSPO #1569
  
   Problem:
   --------
   If the Units per Dose of an order are entered as "0" or a non-numeric 
   value, the units per dose is recorded as 0. This is contrary to the 
   documentation, which states that under these circumstances, the units 
   per dose should be 1.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modified routines PSJBCMA, PSJORRE, PSJORRE1, PSJORRN, PSJORRN1, 
   PSJORRO, and PSJPXRM1 so that Units per Dose is interpreted as 1 when 
   sent to BCMA if its value in Inpatient Medications is 0.
  
   Note: Displaying the order details in BCMA or CPRS will still show 
   the Units as 0 under Dispense Drugs, however, it is treated as 1 for
   purposes of administering medications. The modification to change
   the display in BCMA and CPRS is a GUI change for both and will be
   considered for a future patch.
  
  
 2. HD0000000296843 - PRN IV Piggyback issues
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Intermittent as needed (PRN) IV Orders created by CPRS which should have
   no value in the SCHEDULE INTERVAL field (#.17) of the IV SUB-FILE 
   (#55.01) are being incorrectly set to 1440 (1 day).
  
   Resolution:
   ----------- 
   Modify routine PSIVORFA to not set SCHEDULE INTERVAL field (#.17) to a
   default of 1440 when no schedule is set.
  
  
 3. HD0000000308987 - Medications Due Worksheet
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Intravenous push (IVP) orders are not showing up on the medications due 
   worksheet.
   
   Resolution:
   ----------- 
   Routines PSJMDIR and PSJMIV have been modified to include Intravenous 
   push (IVP) orders under the IVPB selection of the worksheet.
  
  
 4. HD0000000315378 - Active meds on the meds tab orders held by pharmacy
                      are not showing to the providers.
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The Meds tab in CPRS is not showing active orders that have been placed 
   on HOLD when the sort type is by Drug (Alphabetical).
  
   Resolution:
   ----------- 
   Modified routine PSJORRN1 so the API that is called to retrieve the 
   Active orders sorted by Drug (Alphabetical) includes active orders on
   HOLD.
  
  
 5. HD0000000370411 - Meds Tab incorrectly displaying inpatient meds.
  
   Problem:
   --------
   In CPRS, when the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS parameter is not set, some
   non-active orders remain visible even though none should be.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------- 
   Modified routines PSJORRN, PSJORRN1, and PSJORRO so that non-active
   orders are not visible at all when the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS parameter
   is not set.
