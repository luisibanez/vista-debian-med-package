 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000538447 - Schedule type change causes problems
  
   Problem:
   -------
   This patch fixes an issue with Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] in which 
   it is possible to change the Schedule Type of an order from One-Time to 
   Continuous, even if the Schedule itself is a One-Time Schedule.  This 
   results in confusion when an order which appears to be One-Time does 
   not expire after being given.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routines PSGOE8 and PSGOE9 so that changing the Schedule Type 
   to Continuous is not allowed if the Schedule's Type in the 
   ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE File is One-Time.
  
 2. HD0000000474864 - Start date/time issue.  Ordered entered for bid, 
                      edit before
  
   Patient Safety Issue:
   ---------------------
   PSPO #2010
  
   Problem:
   -------
   In Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], when editing the Schedule field on a 
   new Unit Dose order before it has been accepted, the Start Time of the
   order is not re-calculated to coincide with the new admin times.  This
   is because the Schedule field is not a starred field before the order is
   accepted.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   This patch adds a warning message in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] at 
   the request of the Inpatient Medications Workgroup.  The message
   displays when editing the Schedule field on a new order before it has
   been accepted.  The message reads, "This may cause the Admin Times and
   the Start Time to be out of sync."  This message will only display if
   the Inpatient Ward Parameter DEFAULT START DATE CALCULATION is not set
   to USE NOW AS DEFAULT.
  
 3. HD0000000475079 - Dispensing Drug Problem
  
   Problem:
   -------
   This patch corrects an error in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] in which 
   it is possible to trigger the creation of a new order by editing the 
   Orderable Item of an order, and simply keeping it the same.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed the routine PSGOE9 so that changing the Orderable Item to 
   itself will not trigger the creation of a new order.
