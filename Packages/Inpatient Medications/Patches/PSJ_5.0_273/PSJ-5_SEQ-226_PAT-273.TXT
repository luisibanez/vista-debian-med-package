 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000590288 - IV ORDER PROVIDER CAN NOT CHOOSE IV TYPE
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When creating or renewing a Chemotherapy IV order of admixture type, if
   the number of labels printed today exceeds the Bottle number for this
   order, the additive will not show up on the label.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSIVLABL so that the additive will print on Chemotherapy
   admixture IV order labels.
  
  
 2. HD0000000585063 - Pharmacy Data Management
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When a patient has been discharged with a Discharge Type = 'Regular'
   and then the patient has been marked deceased from the Death Entry [DG
   DEATH ENTRY] option, the warning message when attempting to select that
   patient will read, "PATIENT IS FOUND TO BE DISCHARGED AS OF [date]",
   instead of "DECEASED".
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed routine PSJP to look at a patient's date of death in addition  
   to discharges due to death to determine if a patient is deceased.
  
  
  
 3. HD0000000293344 - LIMSTOP+7^PSIVORFB Errors
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When an IV order is finished by a pharmacist in Inpatient Order Entry 
   [PSJ OE], and then verified by a nurse in CPRS, an UNDEFINED error will 
   occur.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed PSIVORFB so that the UNDEFINED error no longer occurs.
