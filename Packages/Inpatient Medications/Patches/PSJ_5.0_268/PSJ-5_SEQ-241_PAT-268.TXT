Description:
============

 ***************************Attention*************************
 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application
 (MOCHA) v1.0 Enhancements 1 group of patches. There are a total of eight
 patches and one .KID (host) file that must be installed as a group. The
 patches must be installed in the following order:
  
 OR*3*352
 PSS*1*164
 PSS*1*169
 PSO*7*390
 PSO*7*417
 PSJ*5*268
 <xxx>_1_0_P23.KID
 PSJ*5*260
 PSJ*5*288
  
 For the ".KID" file, value of <xxx> will be determined by the ward 
 automated dispensing equipment in use at your facility. If no ward
 automated dispensing equipment is in use at your site, this file will not
 be needed. For those sites using Pyxis, xxx=PPU, for Omnicell, xxx=OPU and
 for McKesson sites, xxx=MPU. To obtain this file or if additional
 information is required regarding this ".KID" file, please contact your
 site's Informatix contact.
  
 This patch is designed and intended to "decouple" the automated 
 dispensing machine interface calls from the current Inpatient Medication
 (IP) package routines. The interfaces calls are currently imbedded in 
 regular "patched routines" at the sites using a Pyxis, Omnicell, or 
 McKesson automated dispensing machine. This patch creates a new "shell" 
 routine (PSJADM) to which interface calls can be added. The routines 
 being affected by "decoupling" are PSGOEE, PSGOETO, PSGOEV, PSJHLV, 
 PSJCOMR, and PSJOEA2. In the past, anytime these routines were patched at
 the sites using one of the machines listed above, the local modified 
 routine(s) would have to be backed up and saved before patching could 
 occur. The local mods would be lost otherwise. After patching, the 
 patched routines would have to be incorporated into the locally modified
 routines in order for the automated dispensing machines to operate 
 properly and appropriately.
  
  
 ************************ WARNING ******************************
  
 If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface from 
 Informatix Laboratories Corp. (ILC), this patch will overwrite routines 
 that contain the local modifications. These routines are PSGOEE, PSGOET0,
 PSGOEV, PSJCOMR, PSJHLV, and PSJOEA2.  This could affect certain orders 
 being sent across this interface. The modifications will have to be 
 reintroduced following installation of this patch. You should contact 
 your ILC representative who will supply you with a NEW PSJADM routine 
 which contains the interface code. This will be a one-time only install.
  
 ****************************************************************
  
 **The 2nd line of routine PSJOEA2 does not list patch 267.  This 
 will be corrected in a future release.**
