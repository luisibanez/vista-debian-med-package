Subject: IMR4 NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT, UNLIMITED LENGTH SI/OPI

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 ******************************* WARNING **********************************
  
 If your facility has the Pyxis/Omnicell/McKesson interface from ILC this
 patch will overwrite any local modifications in routines PSJOEA2, PSGOEE, 
 PSGOETO, and PSGOEV. This could affect certain orders being sent across
 this interface. The modifications will have to be reintroduced following
 installation of this patch.
  
 **************************************************************************
 ******************************* ATTENTION ********************************
  
 The IMR4 UNLIMITED SI/OPI TEXT, LAST INJECTION SITE enhancement includes 4
 patches which must be installed in the following order:
  
  1. PSS*1*171
  2. PSJ*5*267
  3. PSB*3*68
  4. PSB*3*69
  
 ************************************************************************* 
  
  
 Enhancements
 =====================
  
 1. Special Instructions/Other Print Info
  ________________________________________
  With this enhancement, Special Instructions and Other Print Info have
  been modified to support an unlimited amount of text. The existing
  functionality that copies the provider comments from the Computerized
  Patient Record System (CPRS) to be copied into each field has been
  retained, and an additional action has been added to optionally open a
  word processing edit dialog after copying the provider comments into the
  appropriate field (Special Instructions for Unit Dose, Other Print Info 
  for IV).
  
  Special Instructions and Other Print Info may also be entered
  and/or edited from within Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 order entry 
  options.
  
  Prior to this enhancement, Inpatient Medications maximum character
  length for Special Instructions was 180 characters and for Other Print
  Info the maximum length was 60 characters. This enhancement resolves
  Patient Safety Issues PSPO 42, 1466 / Remedy Ticket HD336419
  - Comment lengths between CPRS and Pharmacy.
  
 2. No Allergy Assessment
  ________________________ 
  The No Allergy Assessment enhancement provides an interactive alert to
  the pharmacist in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 when no allergy assessment
  is on file for the patient, and a method for the pharmacist to enter an
  allergy assessment after receiving the alert.  A pharmacy intervention 
  is automatically created if the pharmacist chooses to not enter an
  assessment. 
  
   ** NOTE: The new NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT interventions will 
            not be logged until patch PSS*1*171 is installed.        
  
  The No Allergy Assessment functionality will be available at the 
  following options:
  
    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
    Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
    Order Entry [PSJU NE]
    Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER]
    Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
  
 When a patient with no allergy assessment is selected from one of the
 affected options, the following message will be displayed to the
 pharmacist: 
  
 "NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter
 one now?" 
  
  - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
    for allergy information. 
  - If the pharmacist enters 'NO' at this prompt, a pharmacist intervention
    is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is
    then prompted for Provider and Recommendation. A new Recommendation,
    'UNABLE TO ASSESS', has been created specifically  for this type of 
    intervention.
  
  This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSPO 445.
  
  
 Defects Addressed
 =========================
  
 1. HD 187184 - IV Med Stop Date
  
    Problem
    -------
    When an IV order is renewed the status automatically changes to
    expired, but the stop date does not change to the time the order
    actually stops.
  
    Resolution
    ----------
    Routine PSJHL3 has been modified to correctly set the stop date of the
    order that has been renewed to the time of renewal. 
  
  
  2. HD 176676/PSPO 480 - Inpatient doesn't change order status to Expired.
     
     Problem
     -------
     The Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 package does not change order status
     to Expired when sending orders to CPRS with Stop Date/Time in the 
     past.
  
     Solution:
     ---------
     Routine PSJHL3 has been modified to change the order status to 
     Expired, if the order's Stop Date/Time is in the past, when sending 
     orders to CPRS. 
     **This is a partial solution addressing Inpatient Medications V.5.0
       functionality only. Patch OR*3*350 addresses CPRS GUI functionality.
  
  3. HD 377288 (original) - Default response should be "No"
     
     Problem
     -------
     When an Inpatient Unit Dose order's Dosage Ordered field does not 
     match the dosage indicated by the Dispense Drug and Units per 
     Dose fields, the warning prompt "Would you like to continue
     verifying the order?" is displayed after accepting the order via the 
     AC-Accept action. The prompt's default response is "Yes", even though 
     the order is flawed.
                          
     The Inpatient Medications Workgroup has requested 
     this be changed to "No".
  
     Solution
     -------- 
     When an Inpatient Unit Dose order's Dosage Ordered fi eld does not 
     match the dosage indicated by the Dispense Drug and Units per 
     Dose fields, the default response for the prompt "Would you like to
     continue verifying the order?" will be changed to "No", as requested 
     by the Inpatient Medications Workgroup.
  
  
  4. HD 273000 (original) - Field Validation Not Correct
  
     Problem
     -------
     When a second Dispense drug is added to a Unit Dose medication order,
     and no Dosage Ordered is selected, the following message display:
  
         THE FOLLOWING IS EITHER INVALID OR MISSING FROM THIS ORDER:
  
         THIS FIELD IS NECESSARY FOR VERIFICATION.
         Enter RETURN to continue or '^' to exit: 
  
     Note that there is no actual field name displayed as an invalid field.
     This is incorrect. 
  
     Solution
     --------
     In CHK^PSGOEV the variable CHK gets set to 8 and there is no handling
     for a value of 8. The message is correct when CHK is set to 7.
  
  
  5. HD 517634/PSPO 2137 - Provider Comments not displayed.
  
     Problem
     -------
     Provider Comments for continuous IV orders are not displaying in CPRS
     after the order is verified in Inpatient Medications.
  
     Resolution
     ----------
     When IV orders are verified in Inpatient Medications, if the order
     contains Provider Comments, include the Provider Comments in the
     update sent to CPRS in order to keep the order synchronized.
  
  6. HD 586428/PSPO 2137 - Provider Comments not displayed after Verify.
  
     Problem
     -------
     When an IV order is created with Provider Comments, and then edited
     prior to verification so as to trigger the creation of a new order,
     Provider Comments do not carry over to the new order if auto-verify 
     is not used. As a result, the verifying pharmacist may not see the
     original Provider Comments.
  
     Solution
     --------
     Prior to the initial verification of an order, the original Provider 
     Comments should carry over to new a order created due to edit, so that
     the pharmacist verifying the order has an opportunity to see the 
     Provider Comments.
