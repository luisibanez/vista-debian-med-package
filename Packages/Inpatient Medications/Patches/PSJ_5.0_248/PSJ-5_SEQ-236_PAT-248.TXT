Subject: EDIT IVPB START DATE WARNING MESSAGE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch will provide solutions to existing issues in Patient 
 Medications and the IV Site Parameters option. This patch 
 corrects the following issues:
   
  1. The warning message displayed when an IVPB order's start date was 
     before the last BCMA dose due was too confusing for users.
  2. An Undefined Error occurs when a report is queued using the 7-Day
     Medical Administration Report (MAR) 
  3. An Undefined Error occurs when prompts are skipped in IV Site
     Parameters

 Remedy Overview:
 ===============         
 1. HD0000000489715 - UNABLE TO CHANGE STOP DATE
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Patch PSJ*5*179 corrected a potential double-dosing issue by introducing 
 a check on edits of starred fields in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE].  
  
 Editing a starred field causes a new order to be created. When editing 
 an IVPB order, if the Start Date of the new order is before the last Bar
 Code Medical Administration (BCMA) given, the user will receive a warning
 message and edits will not be allowed until the Start Date is updated.
  
 The resulting warning message was too confusing for users and the 
 Inpatient Medications Workgroup decided to clarify the message. 
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Warning message was changed in accordance with the decision of the 
 Inpatient Medications Workgroup.  The message now reads: "*** Start 
 date/time must be set AFTER last BCMA admin time (date/time) of this 
 medication ***" instead of "*** Start date/time CANNOT be before given
 last dose due (date/time) ***"
   
   
 2. HD0000000486776 - 7 Day MAR for Clinic or Clinic Group
   
 Problem:
 -------
  
 If a report is queued in 7-Day MAR [PSJU 7D MAR] for Clinics or Clinic 
 Groups, an undefined error will result and the report will not run.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 PSGMMAR was modified so the undefined error does not occur.
   
   
 3. HD0000000415472 - I received a hard error when editing the site
                      parameter for the IV printer
   
 Problem:
 -------
 While editing fields using the SIte Parameters (IV) option [PSJI SITE   
 PARAMETERS] (#59.5), if the user skips to the Delivery Time prompt and
 does not start with Start of Coverage, the user will receive an undefined
 error. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Input template PSJI SITE PARAMETERS (file #59.5) was modified so that the
 template uses the proper variable for the IV room.
