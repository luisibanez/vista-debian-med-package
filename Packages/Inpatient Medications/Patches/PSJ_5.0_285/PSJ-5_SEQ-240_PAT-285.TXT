Subject: FIX INVALID INFUSION RATE ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues in the Inpatient Medications 
 package:
  
 1. A trailing zero in the Infusion Rate can cause an Invalid Infusion
    Rate error.
  
 2. When editing the Admin Times on an active order with a day-of-week   
    schedule, an <UNDEFINED> error will occur.
  
 3. Changing the Schedule of an IVPB order from a schedule with a frequency
    to a schedule without a frequency will result in an inaccurate Dose Due
    line for the new order.

 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 =========================
 1. HD0000000497619 - invalid infusion rates
  
 2. HD0000000617617 - ERROR - <UNDEFINED>A41+8^PSGOE91
  
 3. HD0000000612618 - IV label shows dose due in 2011
  
  
 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000497619
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When entering an IV order in CPRS, if the Infusion Rate is entered 
    with a trailing zero after the decimal point (e.g. 10.0), then when the
    order is signed, an error of "Invalid Infusion Rate" will result.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed routine PSJHLU so that a decimal with trailing zeroes is 
    properly interpreted as a valid number.
  
  
 2. HD0000000617617
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When editing the Admin Times on an active order with a day-of-week 
    schedule, an <UNDEFINED> error will occur because the variable ZZND
    is not defined for day-of-week schedules.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed PSGOE91 so that the <UNDEFINED> error does not occur.
  
  
 3. HD0000000612618
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When editing an active IVPB order and Auto-Verify is set to "Yes" for 
    the user, changing the Schedule from a schedule with a frequency to a 
    schedule without a frequency causes the old frequency to remain, 
    resulting in an inaccurate "dose due" line for the new order.
   
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed PSIVORFB so that the frequency is properly reset when changing 
    the schedule.
