Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 FY11 Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements (PSPO 738/PSI-07-122)
  
 The enhancement contained in this patch revises the existing display in
 the Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] option from a patient list 
 sorted alphabetically by TEAM and PATIENT NAME to a categorized listing 
 sorted by a patient's highest priority order. 
  
 Patients that have one or more STAT Pending or Non-Verified orders will
 be listed first, followed by patients with one or more ASAP Pending or
 Non-Verified orders, and then all other patients that have only ROUTINE 
 Pending or Non-Verified orders. Within a given priority, patients will 
 continue to be sub-sorted alphabetically by TEAM name and PATIENT name.
  
 Examples shown here.  Note the addition of PRIORITY column.
