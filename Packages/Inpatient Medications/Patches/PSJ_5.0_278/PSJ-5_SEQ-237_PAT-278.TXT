 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. HD0000000317650 - Old active orderable items display
  
    Patient Safety Issue:
    ---------------------
    PSPO #1378
    PSPO #2125
  
    Problem:
    -------
    When the Dispense Drug of an active order is matched to a new 
    Orderable Item, and then that order is renewed and verified, the new
    order shows the old Orderable Item with "INVALID DISPENSE DRUG" in the
    black highlighted message section, when the order is viewed after it is
    verified. The Dispense Drug is correct, but it is no longer matched to
    the old Orderable Item that is displayed.
  
    Resolution:
    ----------
    Changed routine PSGOER so that the orderable item will be properly 
    updated during the renewal process.
  
  
 2. HD0000000622135 - STACK ERROR ON ENTERING THE IPM ACTION PROFILE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When viewing the Action Profile #1 option in Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ
    OE], if the user has edited the ROUTE field for this order, it will 
    cause a <SUBSCRIPT> error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the routine PSGAP0 so that unrelated global data is killed 
    before the Action Profile #1 is run, preventing the <SUBSCRIPT> error.
