 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
 1. HD0000000343923 - When entering new UNIT DOSE order in VistA, using 
                      <space bar> <enter> at the SCHEDULE prompt causes an
                      error
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When entering a new Unit Dose order or editing an existing order in
    Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE], at the Schedule prompt, using <space 
    bar> <enter> causes an Undefined error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PSGS0 to allow a response of <space bar> <enter>
    as a valid entry.
  
  
 2. HD0000000460212 - IV QUICK CODE USUAL IV SCHEDULE field will no longer 
                      accept standard schedule space PRN
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When editing the "Usual IV Schedule" for an IV quick code from the 
    Additives File [PSSJI DRUG] option, entering a schedule followed by a
    space and "PRN", when a PRN version of that schedule does not exist in 
    the Administration Schedule File [#51.1], will cause an undefined 
    error.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the routine PSGS0 so that the undefined error no longer 
    occurs.
  
  
 3. HD0000000523772 - DIN drug information link is displaying wrong 
                      information
  
    Problem: 
    --------
    When viewing Pending or Non-Verified orders in Inpatient Order Entry 
    [PSJ OE], if a user views a Pending/Non-Verified IV order followed by a
    Pending/Non-Verified Unit Dose order and then views the Drug
    Restriction/Guideline Info (DIN) for the Unit Dose order, it will
    display the DIN for the IV order instead.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed routine PSJDIN so that the DIN option correctly identifies 
    Unit Dose orders and displays the proper drug information.
