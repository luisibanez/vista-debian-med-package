Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI 
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx

 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to OR*3*280 is included in

 needed to implement CPRS GUI v28.
  
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This patch sends and receives Intravenous (IV) bags information between
 Inpatient Medications and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) for an
 IV order.  The data is being stored in the Additive Frequency field of 
 the RXC segment.
  
 The Reminder Order Checks messages coming from CPRS can be quite long and 
 this patch has modified a routine (PSJHL4) to store all the data correctly
 in the NON-VERIFIED ORDERS file (#53.1).
