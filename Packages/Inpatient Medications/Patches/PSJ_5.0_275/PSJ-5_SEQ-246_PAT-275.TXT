Description:
============

 Edit Clinic Med Orders Start Date/Time
 ======================================
 This patch implements a new Vista option that allows users to
 quickly find clinic orders that are associated with a specific
 clinic location (or specific patient), and date range, and quickly 
 change the Start Date/Time of one or more selected clinic orders.
  
 The new option EDIT CLINIC MED ORDERS START DATE/TIME [PSJ ECO] allows
 the user to search for clinic orders by clinic group, clinic, or by
 patient. After entering a clinic group, clinic, or patient, a beginning
 and ending date range must be entered to find orders with a start
 date/time within the specified range.
  
 When searching by clinic, all patients with at least one clinic order
 for the specified clinic and date range are displayed in a list, and
 one or more patients may be selected from the list. After a patient is
 selected, only clinic orders matching the specified clinic and date range 
 are displayed.
  
 When searching by clinic group, all patients with at least one clinic 
 order in the specified clinic group are displayed in a list, and one or
 more patients may be selected from the list. After a patient is selected,
 only the clinic orders matching the specified clinic group and date range 
 are displayed.
  
 When searching by patient, clinic location is not specified, therefore, 
 all clinic orders within the selected date range are displayed, for 
 all clinic locations.
  
 For searches by clinic and by patient, from the clinic profile view, 
 one or more clinic orders may be selected for start date/time editing.
 The new start date/time is entered once, and applied to all selected
 clinic orders. 
  
 Two new actions are available from the clinic profile view: VP (View
 Profile), and VD (View Order Detail). The VP (View Profile) action
 displays the full Inpatient medication profile, and the VD (View 
 Order Detail) action prompts for a specific clinic order from the numbered
 list, and displays the detailed view of the order.
  
  
 Patient Profile Clinic Orders
 =============================
 Clinic Orders will display in the patient profile grouped by Clinic, 
 separate from non-Clinic Orders. Clinic Orders will display after all 
 active, pending, and non-verified non-Clinic Orders. Non-Active 
 non-Clinic orders will display after Clinic Orders.
  
 The following menu options, and any actions that execute these options,
 will be enhanced to separate clinic orders from non-clinic orders:
  
       Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] 
       Order Entry [PSJU NE] 
       Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW] 
       Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER] 
       Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
       Action Profile #1 [PSJU AP-1] 
       Action Profile #2  [PSJU AP-2]
       Patient Profile (Unit Dose) [PSJU PR]

  Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
  -----------------------------
   2359 - Provider comments intended for a specific order are copied on
          another order upon renewal.
   
   
  Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
  ---------------------------
   HD 764596/INC 781899 - Other Print Info display incorrectly.
    Problem
    --------
    When two or more Pending IV renews or Non-Verified edited IV orders
    containing Other Print Info are selected in Inpatient Order Entry using
    a dash, 1-3 to view orders 1, 2, and 3, the orders following the first
    order mistakenly display the first order's Other Print Info. 
   
    Solution
    --------
    When selecting multiple Pending Renewed IV orders or multiple
    Non-Verified edited IV orders by using a dash in Inpatient Order Entry,
    initialize contents of Other Print Info between orders so the Other
    Print Info is displayed with the proper order.
  
  
  
   HD 760186 - Other Print Info from IV Quick Code not used. 
    Problem
    --------
    Other Print Info copied in from Provider Comments not being overwritten
    by Other Print info in a selected IV Quick Code.
  
    Solution
    --------
    Restore previous functionality. When an order that can be finished as 
    Unit Dose or IV is finished as an IV, and the user is prompted for  
    Additive, if the finishing pharmacist enters an IV Quick Code that 
    contains Other Print Info text, that text should overwrite the contents
    of the order's Other Print Info.
  
  
   
   HD 763244 - Undefined error in 7 Day Mar.
    Problem
    --------
    Undefined error occurs when printing a PRN IV order in the 7Day MAR
    [PSJU 7D MAR] option.
  
    Solution
    ---------
    Prevent undefined error from occurring.
  
   
   
   HD 756354 - Undefined error in CPRS IV label print.
    Problem
    --------
    Undefined error occurs when printing an IV Label from the Chart Copy
    dialog after signing an order in CPRS.
           
    Solution: Prevent undefined error from occurring.
   
  
   
   HD 763555 - Wrong intervention recommendation is filed.
    Problem
    --------
    NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT type of intervention does not file correct
    recommendation when a custom entry exists with an Internal Entry 
    Number (IEN) equal to the number 10 in the APSP INTERVENTION
    RECOMMENDATION (#9009032.5) file.
   
    Solution
    ---------
    Enable the NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT type of interventions to handle custom
    entries in the APSP INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATION (#9009032.5) file. When
    the UNABLE TO ASSESS recommendation is selected as the Recommendation 
    of a NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT intervention, the Recommendation should be 
    stored properly with the intervention even when the UNABLE TO ASSESS 
    entry in the APSP INTERVENTION RECOMMENDATION (#900903.5) file has an
    Internal Entry Number other than the number 10.
  
           
   
   HD 770025 - Long Special Instructions not retained after CPRS Renew
    Problem
    --------
    Long Special Instructions (greater than 180 characters) and Other Print
    Info (greater than 60 characters) are not carried over to the Pending 
    renewal order after the order is renewed in CPRS.
   
    Solution
    --------
    Retain long Special Instructions (greater than 180 characters) and
    Other Print Info (greater than 60 characters) in the Pending renewal
    order when the order is renewed from CPRS.
  
  
   INC 815711 - Move enhanced order check so it quits correctly.
    Problem
    --------
    The dosing order check occurs before the enhanced order check. The
    dosing order check is not yet active, therefore no functional issues 
    result. However, problems could occur when the dosing order check 
    is released and activated.
  
    Solution
    ---------
    Move enhanced order check so that it occurs before the dosing order 
    check. 
  
  
   INC 806890 - Order status not set correctly 
    Problem
    --------
    If a user goes into the Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE] after an IMO
    order has expired and before the ORMTIME RUN option has run to
    "correctly" change the status, the status is filed incorrectly: so
    that the necessary cross references are not triggered. This is causing
    patient care issues.
  
    Solution
    ---------
    File the status correctly when a user goes into the Inpatient Order 
    Entry [PSJ OE] after an IMO order has expired and before the ORMTIME 
    RUN option has run. This will cause the necessary cross references to 
    trigger.
