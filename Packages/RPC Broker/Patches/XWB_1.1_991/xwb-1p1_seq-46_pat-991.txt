Subject: M2M Security Fixes Part 1

  This is NOT a VA patch. It was developed by an OSEHRA working group,
  the Special Software Enhancement Project. Check with your VISTA support
  experts before installing this patch.
 
 
Description:
============
 Recently, a software vulnerability was identified in VISTA. The
 vulnerability would allow hackers to gain access to VISTA code and data
 through Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
 
 Patch XWB*1.1*991 fixes the vulnerability. The patch makes five kinds of
 changes to the broker:
   1. Security improvements
   2. New VISTA parameter: XWBM2M
   3. M2M Broker now responds properly to VISTA parameter XWBDEBUG
   4. Improved support for the broker on GT.M on Linux
   5. General cleanup, annotation, and debugging
             
 To limit the ability of hackers to discover and exploit the
 vulnerability, we are keeping its exact nature confidential until we are
 sure that most sites are protected. More information about the
 vulnerability, and what was done to patch it, will be released in a
 future patch.
 
 The patch introduces a new parameter: XWBM2M. This parameter can be set
 to "No, Disabled" ONLY at sites that are NOT using software that depends
 on the M-to-M Broker (such as VISTA Imaging). If your site IS using
 software that depends on the M-to-M Broker (such as VISTA Imaging), you
 should leave this parameter set to the default of "Yes, Enabled."
 
 Package Elements Included:
 ==========================
 Routine XWBDLOG is used for Broker debug logging.
 Routine XWBM2MC is the M-to-M Broker client routine.
 Routine XWBP991 is the post-install for this patch.
 Routine XWBRL is the M-to-M Broker socket manager (link methods).
 Routine XWBRM is the M-to-M Broker request manager.
 Routine XWBRMX is the M-to-M Broker XML message parser.
 Routine XWBRPC is the M-to-M Broker parsed-message request handler.
 Routine XWBTCPM is the RPC Broker main routine.
 Routine XWBUTL is the M-to-M Broker utilities library.
 Routine XWBVLL is the M-to-M Broker listener.
 Parameter Definition XWBM2M is the M-to-M Broker Enabled? parameter.
 
 Documentation Changes:
 ======================
 The most up-to-date Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Broker end-user documentation
 is available on the VHA Software Document Library (VDL) at the following
 Internet Website: http://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=23 
 
 NOTE: VISTA documentation is made available online in Microsoft Word format
 (.DOC) and Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (.PDF).
 
 Although this patch introduces a new parameter and changes to several
 routines, for security reasons the RPC Broker documentation will not be
 updated until part two of this series of patches is released.
  
 Test Sites:

 Blood Bank Team Coordination: 
 =============================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XWB*1.1*991 contains
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of VISTA
 Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does not alter or
 modify any VISTA Blood Bank software-design safeguards or safety-critical
 elements or functions.
 
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XWB*1.1*991 have no effect on Blood Bank
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
 
 Installation Instructions: 
 ==========================
 1. ***IMPORTANT*** If your site is running the DICOM Gateway, then before
    you disable broker services in step 2, close the connection on the DICOM
    Gateway side, to avoid generating errors there while broker services are
    down. If your DICOM Gateway serves a group of hospitals rather than just
    yours, then you will need to coordinate the simultaneous installation of
    this patch at all the sites in your group.
 
 2. The patch should be installed when users are off the system and broker
    services are disabled.
 
 3. You DO NOT need to stop Taskman or the background filers.
 
 4. On the KIDS menu, under the Installation menu, use the following options:
 
    Load a Distribution
    Verify Checksums in Transport Global
    Print Transport Global
    Compare Transport Global to Current System
    Backup a Transport Global

 6. If your site is NOT running software that depends on the M-to-M Broker
    (such as VISTA Imaging), set the XWBM2M parameter to 'No, Disabled' as
    described in the Description section above.
 
 7. Let users back on the system and enable broker services.
 
 8. If your site is running the DICOM Gateway, then re-open the connection on
    the DICOM Gateway side.
