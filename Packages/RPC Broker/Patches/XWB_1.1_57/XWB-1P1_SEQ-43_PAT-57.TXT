Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains changes to a single routine (XWBPRS) which provides
 the ability to monitor Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) 
 foreground coversheet load times by Capacity Management.
  
 Caution:  The modified routine is directly involved in the handling of 
 Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) from GUI applications using RPC Broker 
 connections.  There is the possibility that installation of this patch 
 will impact GUI applications that are currently running RPCs, resulting in
 EDITED errors.  It is recommended that the patch be installed without
 users on the system, or at least with minimal users (and with users being
 asked to sign-off or be inactive during the period in which the patch will
 be installed).
