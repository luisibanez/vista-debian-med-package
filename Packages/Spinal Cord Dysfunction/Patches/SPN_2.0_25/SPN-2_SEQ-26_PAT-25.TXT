Subject: Remove References to Obsolete ICD Fields

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 In October 2003, certain fields in the VistA ICD Diagnosis, ICD 
 Procedures, CPT, and CPT Modifier standard tables were identified as 
 obsolete and to be replaced with newer data elements implementing data 
 versioning in these tables.  Under the Code Set Versioning Project, the
 code names, descriptions, inactive flags and dates were replaced by
 versioned data elements, each with an effective date of use.
  
 A thorough review of the Spinal Cord Dysfunction (v2) package
 has been completed.  This patch removes all references to the obsolete
 fields in the ICD Diagnosis file (#80).  It has been determined that there
 are no references to the obsolete fields in the 3 other affected code files
 mentioned above.
 
 The modifications made by this patch affect only two reports, replacing 
 references to the obsolete, un-versioned DIAGNOSIS field (#3) of the
 ICD Diagnosis file (#80) with the versioned form of that field provided by
 the supported $$ICDDX^ICDCODE API. The two modified report options are
 SCI/SCD Discharges [SPN PRINT DISCHARGE] and SCI/SCD Admissions
 [SPN PRINT ADMISSIONS].
