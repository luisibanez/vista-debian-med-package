RELEASE INFORMATION
===================
A new version of VistALink, v1.6, is being provided, adding support for 
newer WebLogic application server versions (v9.2 and higher). VistALink 
consists of Java-side adapter libraries and an M-side listener, enabling 
Java and J2EE applications to call and execute existing Remote Procedure 
Calls (RPCs) on VistA M servers. VistALink is being leveraged by an 
expanding number of existing and future J2EE applications.
 
This new version was tested at the following Medical Center test sites:
 
 - Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (North Chicago, IL)
 - Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center (Augusta, GA)
 - El Paso VA Health Care System (El Paso, TX)
 - Gulf Coast Veterans Health Care System (Biloxi, MS)

   reduce resource consumption of resource adapter libraries
 
 - Support for J2CA v1.5-compatible resource adapters, including the 
   ability for to deploy and manage multiple adapters as a single 
   deployment unit 
 
 - Elimination of DNS lookup caching of M system IP addresses (allowing

   resource adapters)
