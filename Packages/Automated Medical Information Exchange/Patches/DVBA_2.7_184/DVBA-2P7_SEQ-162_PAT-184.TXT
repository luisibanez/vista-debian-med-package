 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v184 and this VistA patch 
    (DVBA*2.7*184).
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. HD0000000622883 (INC000000622883) - AMIE is sending unencrypted 
          email upon adding or cancelling C&P exams.
  
      
       Problem
       -------
       When adding or cancelling a C&P exam, AMIE sends out email 
       notifications that contain PII if user has an Outlook email address.
  
       1. This only happens when a user has an email address defined in the
          New Person file, and the user adds a new exam using AMIE option
          DVBA C ADD ADDITIONAL EXAM or cancels an exam using AMIE option
          DVBA C CANCEL REQUESTS/EXAMS.
       2. If the user adds an exam via CAPRI this notification DOES NOT GET
          SENT to the Outlook email address.
  
       Solution
       --------
       Routines that generate emails for C&P exams were modified to remove 
       any identifiable patient data and to replace it with the internal
       patient number (DFN) which can be used as a patient lookup.
  
  
   2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed: NONE.
  
  
   3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
      Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are being
      addressed:
  
      a.   Automate C&P Exam transmission to VVA upon 2507 release to RO.
           Insert logic to utilize the new Virtual VA web service to 
           automatically file the completed exam results to Virtual VA upon
           the releasing of the exam request to the RO.
  
      b.   Create a new tab for the retrieval and displaying of available 
           documents in the Veteran/Service Member's electronic claim
           folder Integrate a new Virtual VA web service that will enable
           VHA users to connect to VVA to retrieve a listing of all
           available documents in the associated eFolder(s).
  
      c.   New Document Type for Record Transmissions to Virtual VA via 
           Web Service Interface for records transmitted to Virtual VA via
           web service. There are currently two document types: "CAPRI
           Medical Records" and "C&P Exam." For records retrieved by the
           user from the DoD tab, neither document type is appropriate. The
           appropriate indexing value for records contained within this tab
           would be service treatment records (STRs). The customer is
           requesting that a third indexing value be implemented for these
           record types.
  
      d.   Rename the priority of exam code "DCS - DES Claimed Condition
           By Svcmbr" to "IDES" and remove the "DFD - DES Fit for Duty"
           priority of exam code. Convert all existing "DCS" and "DFD"
           priority of exam codes to "IDES".
           
        1. CAPRI/AMIE - AMIS 290 Reports
           - CAPRI RPC: DVBAB AMIS REPORT 
             AMIS 290 and AMIS 290 by Division Reports
           - AMIE Options: DVBA C AMIS REPORT
                           DVBA C RO AMIS 290
        
           Modifications to CAPRI and the AMIE software were required to
           support combining the two "DES" Priority of Exam codes into one 
           "IDES" code in the 2507 Request File (#396.3).
        
        2. CAPRI/AMIE - Insufficient Exam Report (Detailed and Summary)
           - AMIE Option: DVBA Insufficient Exam Rpt
  
           Modifications to CAPRI and the AMIE software were required to
           support combining the two "DES" Priority of Exam codes into one 
           "IDES" code in the 2507 Request File (#396.3).
  
        3. AMIE - Health Summary Report
           - AMIE Option: GMTS HS BY PATIENT
  
           Modification to AMIE software was required to support combining
           the two "DES" Priority of Exam codes into one "IDES" code on the
           Health Summary Report.
  
      e.   Add two additional FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) names
           that allow initial connection to the CLAIMS server:
           FORUM.MED.VA.GOV replaces FORUM.VA.GOV and
           CLAIMS.MED.VA.GOV replaces CLAIMS.FORUM.VA.GOV.  The old
           FQDN entries will remain in place to allow backward
           compatibility until everyone is updated.
  
  
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   The following section describes the technical components being exported
   with this patch.

      Partial DD subDD 396.3    field: 9 
  
  
   1. The set of codes data type for the PRIORITY OF EXAM (Field #9) in 
      the 2507 REQUEST File (#396.3) will be updated to replace the 
      following entries:
  
      a. DCS : DES CLAIMED COND BY SVCMBR
      b. DFD : DES FIT-FOR-DUTY
  
      with the new entry:
  
      c. IDES : IDES
  
   2. The following Routines are being added/modified:
  
      a. Modify: DVBCADEX
                 DVBCCNCL
          Description of changes:
          This routine is being modified to include the SITE and REQUEST
          DATE variable to make it available to subsequent routines.
  
      b. Modify: DVBCBULL
                 DVBCBUL1
                 DVBCXFRE
          Description of change:
          This routine is being modified to remove PII from the existing
          email logic. It will remove the SSN, the Patient Name and the
          Claim Number.      
  
      c. Add: DVBA184P
          Routine DVBA184P automatically queues a TaskMan task that
          converts entries in the PRIORITY OF EXAM (#9) field of the 2507
          REQUEST (#396.3) with a Priority Of  Exam Code "DCS" or "DFD" to
          a new code, "IDES". The "ADP" cross-reference will be updated
          to reflect changes in these entries. The installer will receive
          an email notification on completion of the conversion. The
          message will indicate the start and stop time of the process
          and the count of converted records. If the conversion task is
          stopped using a Taskman User option stop request, the installer
          will receive a Mail Man message asking that the post install
          process be re-run. The conversion routine must run to completion
          in order to fully install DVBA*2.7*184. The task can be
          restarted by running POST^DVBA184P.
      
      d. Modify: DVBAB2
                 DVBAB3
          Description of change:
          Changed DES Priority of Exam codes "DCS"and "DFD" to "IDES" to 
          reflect a single IDES code.
       
      e. Modify: DVBAB82
                 DVBCAMIS
          Description of Change:
          Changed DES Priority of Exam codes "DCS"and "DFD" to "IDES" to 
          reflect a single IDES code. Removed the text for "DCS and "DFD"
          and added the text for "IDES" to print on the AMIS 290 Report.
  
      f. Modify: DVBCAMI1
                 DVBCAMI2
                 DVBCAMI3
          Description of Change:
          Changed DES Priority of Exam codes "DCS"and "DFD" to "IDES" to

      i. Modify: DVBCIRPT
                 DVBCIRP1
          Description of Change:
          Changed DES Priority of Exam codes "DCS" and "DFD" to "IDES" to 
          reflect a single IDES code on the Insufficient Exam Report.
          Also, added logic to process "IDES" as a single code instead of
          "DES" as two codes, which used to produce two report sections.
  
      j. Modify: DVBAVRX1
          Description of Change:
          Added logic that will quit the email process and not cause an
          error if the user's email address is set to NULL. While this
          incident should never happen in practice, this patch is removing
          the possibility of a hard crash from ever happening should the

 VI. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES:
  
 ***IMPORTANT NOTE***
  
 With the introduction of "Get Docs from Virtual VA" in patch 
 DVBA*2.7*184, there was an issue discovered with opening large TIFF files 
 with the current Windows Photo Viewer, which is the default viewer on 
 Windows 7 workstations for TIFF files. For this reason it is imperative 
 that prior to the installation of CAPRI Patch DVBA*2.7*184 from a network 
 share drive, the system administrators (IRM Staff) *MUST* validate that 
 workstations running on Windows 7 have Microsoft Office Document Imaging 
 2007 (MODI) installed prior to installing P184 from a network share 
 drive. This notice does not impact workstations running on Windows XP.
  
 If you are upgrading CAPRI in workstation's local hard drive, this 
 pre-requisite should already have been met by an Action Item initiated by 
 ESE. Reference national change order CO161098FY13.
 However if one or more of your workstations have windows 7 and these 
 don't have a CAPRI.EXE on local hard disk, i.e. in case of new installs 
 or running CAPRI from a Network Share then on those workstations this 
 pre-requisite has *not* been automatically met. You can meet this 
 pre-requisite by following the instructions on this link
 Microsoft Office (2007) Document Imaging Build Document (Please refer to 
 DVBA_27_P184_RN.DOC, DVBA_27_P184.PDF, or CAPRI_GUI_ISG.DOC
 for link to document).
 In this document you may use either the SCCM method or the manual method.
  
 All workstations that will run CAPRI.EXE, MUST have this MODI package 
 installed in order to view large .TIFF files.  Even if running CAPRI from 
 the network, this package MUST still be installed on the workstation.
  
  
  1. Users On the System
  
     a. This patch (DVBA*2.7*184) may be installed while CAPRI users are
        still using the previously released version of the CAPRI GUI
        (i.e. DVBA_27_181.exe).
  
     b. Once the installation of this patch has been completed, CAPRI users
        should be upgraded to the new released version of the CAPRI GUI
        (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P184_08.ZIP]). Please refer to the 
        CAPRI_GUI_ISG.doc document within the DVBA_27_P184_08.zip file
        for supplemental installation instructions regarding the
        installation of the following files:
            VACAPRIVVA.dll        Virtual VA dynamically linked library
            CAPRI_Help.chm        CAPRI On-line Help
            CAPRI.map             CAPRI error map
            CAPRISession.r2w      Reflections session configuration
            ssh_config            Secure Shell configuration
  
     c. This patch modifies routines used by the CAPRI GUI application 
        and the Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package. It
        should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to
        users and to reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are
        updated.
  
  2. VistA Options
         
     a. The following VistA options should be disabled while installing
        this patch: NONE.

          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
