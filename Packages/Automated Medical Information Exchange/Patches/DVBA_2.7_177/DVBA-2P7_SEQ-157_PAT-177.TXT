 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v177.
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. HD0000000301104 - Patient info not hidden when switching sites
   
       Problem
       -------
       CAPRI displays the patient's name, SSN, DOB, and ICN at the top of
       the main CAPRI form after selecting a patient.  When the user switches
       sites, the patient name and SSN clear, but the DOB and ICN from
       the previous patient continues to display until after a patient
       is selected at the new site.
   
       Solution
       --------
       The DOB and ICN fields will clear at the same time the patient name
       and SSN clear when switching sites.
  
       b. HD0000000486950 - Admission Report for SC Veterans returns error
                            at Pittsburgh 
   
       Problem
       -------
       The Print One Item Per Page menu option in the CAPRI Reports dialog
       box generates an Access Violation error when attempting to print
       a report with more than 6,000 records.  The Access Violation occurs
       because the existing method used to generate reports depletes the
       user workstation resources.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The method used to generate reports has been converted to a system
       that allows an unlimited number of pages to be generated without
       depleting the user workstation resources.
  
  
  
   2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed:
  
      a. Defect - Request Status field is cleared after trying to re-open
                  a cancelled exam.
  
      Problem
      -------
      The Tools/Manage C&P Exam Requests option displays Canceled exam
      requests in C&P Exam Requests list in the C&P Exam Request Report
      Management dialog box.  Since the business rules were not developed
      for re-opening a Canceled exam in CAPRI, re-opening a Canceled exam
      request record results in the record being in an inconsistent state.
      
  
      Solution
      --------
      Canceled exam requests will no longer display in the C&P Exam Requests
      list for selection to prevent the user from attempting to re-open them.
  
  
      b. Defect - CAPRI patient does not match patient in exam template
                  after selecting a new patient.
       
      Problem
      -------
      CAPRI allows a user to select a new patient when an exam template is
      open for the current patient.
  
      Solution
      --------
      CAPRI now verifies that there are no open exam templates before
      allowing the user to select a new patient.  When an open exam
      template exists, CAPRI displays a dialog box warning the user to
      "Please close the open template" and brings the open template forward
      after clicking "OK".
  
  
      c. Defect - Edit Exam List Parameters option generates List Index Out
                  of Bounds error. 
       
      Problem
      -------
      When a user clicks "Go Back" after clicking either "Edit Selected" or
      "Delete Selected", the "Edit Selected" and "Delete Selected" buttons
      remain enabled even though no items are selected in the "Custom Lists
      Defined..." list in the "Edit Exam List Parameters" dialog box.  If
      the user clicks either "Edit selected" or "Delete selected" again,
      CAPRI generates a "List Index Out of Bounds" error.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The "Edit Selected" and "Delete Selected" buttons will only be enabled
      when an item is selected in the "Custom Lists Defined..." list.
  
      d. Defect - C&P Final reports containing more than 1,000 pages causes
                  error.
       
      Problem
      -------
      The Print menu option in the CAPRI Reports dialog box generates an
      Access Violation error when attempting to print a C&P Final report
      with more than 1,000 pages.  The Access Violation occurs because
      the existing method used to generate reports depletes the user
      workstation resources.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The method used to generate reports has been converted to a system that
      allows an unlimited number of pages to be generated without depleting
      the user workstation resources.
