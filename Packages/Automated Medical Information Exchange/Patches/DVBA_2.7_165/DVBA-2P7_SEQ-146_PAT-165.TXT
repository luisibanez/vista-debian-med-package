 I. OVERVIEW
  
    This patch introduces (M)UMPS server side changes to the VistA Automated
    Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) module in support of the Compensation
    & Pension Record Interchange (CAPRI) package. CAPRI is a graphical user
    interface (GUI) for the VistA Automated Medical Information Exchange
    (AMIE) menu options.
  
    The purpose of this patch is to prevent CAPRI users from using older,
    unsupported versions of the CAPRI GUI.   
  
 II. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
    This patch updates CAPRI parameters in VistA through the post-install
    routine DVBA165P that enforces a new required minimum version when 
    executing the CAPRI GUI. Users signing in with CAPRI will now be
    required to be running the latest released version of the CAPRI GUI,
    DVBA*2.7*149.
  
    After this patch is installed, users who are not running the latest 
    CAPRI GUI (DVBA*2.7*149) will not be allowed to continue using their
    outdated version of CAPRI. Installing/Upgrading to the latest version
    of CAPRI will be necessary in order to continue using this application.
