 ;;disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, and anxiety may be 
"RTN","DVBCWPA4",12,0)
 ;;significant parts of the veteran's history; eliciting these details requires  
"RTN","DVBCWPA4",13,0)
 ;;that one establish a trusting relationship with the veteran. Examine

"RTN","DVBCWPA4",15,0)

 ;;        any other subject.  Mental incompetency, for VA benefits purposes,
"RTN","DVBCWPA5",131,0)
 ;;        means that the veteran, because of injury or disease, is not capable
"RTN","DVBCWPA5",132,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPA5",138,0)
 ;;        things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit payment, knowing
"RTN","DVBCWPA5",139,0)
 ;;        the amounts and types of bills owed monthly, and handling the payment
"RTN","DVBCWPA5",140,0)
 ;;        prudently?  Does the veteran handle the money and pay the bills

 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPA5",143,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPF6",49,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPF6",70,0)
 ;;    NOTE: The complete multi-axial format as specified by DSM-IV may be required

"RTN","DVBCWPF6",90,0)
 ;;    interest, and not to any other subject.  Mental incompetency,
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",91,0)

"RTN","DVBCWPF6",93,0)
 ;;    best interest.  In order to assist raters in making a legal determination

"RTN","DVBCWPF6",95,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",96,0)
 ;;       What is the impact of injury or disease on the veteran's ability

 ;;       of such things as knowing the amount of his or her VA benefit
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",99,0)
 ;;       payment, knowing the amounts and types of bills owed monthly,
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",100,0)
 ;;       and handling the payment prudently?  Does the veteran handle

 ;;       his or her money and pay the bills?
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",102,0)
 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWPF6",103,0)

 ;;
"RTN","DVBCWTB5",8,0)
 ;;A traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of
"RTN","DVBCWTB5",9,0)

"RTN","DVBCWTB5",10,0)
 ;;or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately

 ;;following the event:
"RTN","DVBCWTB5",12,0)

"RTN","DVBCWTB5",19,0)

 ;;      praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not
"RTN","DVBCWTB5",22,0)
 ;;      be transient;

 ;;event.  However, other signs and symptoms may be delayed from days to months

 ;;(e.g., subdural hematoma, seizures, hydrocephalus, spasticity, etc.).  Signs
