 VI. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES
   
   The following section provides pre-installation notes and requirements
   for installing the software.
   
   1. Users On the System
   
     a. CAPRI GUI Users - This patch may be installed while users are
        running the CAPRI GUI.
   
     b. VistA Users - This patch may be installed with users on the
        system, but should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
        disruption to users and to reduce the possibility of errors when
        the routines and file entries are updated.
   
     c. VistA Options - There are no VistA options to disable while
        installing this patch.
   
   2. Software Installation Time
   
     The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off
     peak hours.
   
   3. Required Builds
   
     The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS software
     distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
     without their prior installation.
  
          Required Build(s):
          ------------------
           DVBA*2.7*166
  
 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   
   The following section provides the steps for installing the software.
   
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
   
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
   
    3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*173).
   
      a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
   
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.
   
         CAUTION: Do not use the KIDS "Full Comparison" option. Due to
         the length of some CAPRI Template names, the "Full Comparison"
         option can go into a loop.  This problem has been reported to
         the Kernel developers and will be fixed with XU*8*559. The
         "Second line of Routines Only", "Routines only", and "Old style
         Routine compare" options may be used.
   
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
         to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
         global.
   
      d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*173.
   
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', answer NO.
  
    6. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
   
    7. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA173P is a temporary routine used as
       part of the pre/post-install process and will be automatically
       deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some cases
       Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
       if you discover this at your site.
