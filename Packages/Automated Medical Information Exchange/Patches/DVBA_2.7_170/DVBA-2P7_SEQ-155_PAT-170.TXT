 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000444631 - Updates for 3 AMIE C&P Exam worksheets
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office has 
 approved content changes for the following AMIE C&P examination 
 worksheets:  Ear Disease (#1310), Eating Disorders (Mental Disorders) 
 (#0915), and Epilepsy and Narcolepsy (#1220).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a) Created post-init routine DVBA170P, which will inactivate the existing 
 versions of the Ear Disease, Eating Disorders (Mental Disorders) and 
 Epilepsy and Narcolepsy C&P examination worksheets in the AMIE EXAM
 file (#396.6) and activate the updated versions of each worksheet in the 
 same file.  The current Internal Entry Number (IEN) for each C&P 
 examination worksheet is:  Ear Disease (203), Eating Disorders (Mental 
 Disorders) (204) and Epilepsy and Narcolepsy (115).  The new IEN
 for each C&P examination worksheet will be:  Ear Disease (256), Eating 
 Disorders (Mental Disorders) (257) and Epilepsy and Narcolepsy (258).
  
 b) Created routine DVBCWER5, which will contain the new text for the AMIE 
 C&P Ear Disease examination worksheet.  Created routine DVBCWER4, 
 which will access the text routine and print the blank examination 
 worksheet.
  
 c) Created routine DVBCWEA7, which will contain the new text for the AMIE
 C&P Eating Disorders (Mental Disorders) examination worksheet.  Created 
 routine DVBCWEA6, which will access the text routines and print the blank 
 examination worksheet.
  
 d) Created routine DVBCWEN3, which will contain the new text for the AMIE 
 C&P Epilepsy and Narcolepsy examination worksheet.  Created routine
 DVBCWEN2, which will access the text routine and print the blank 
 examination worksheet.
  
 NEW RECORD ENTRIES:
 ===================
 This patch, through post-init routine DVBA170P, will create 3 new records 
 (IEN=256, IEN=257 and IEN=258) in the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6) for the 
 updated versions of the AMIE C&P Ear Disease examination worksheet, the
 AMIE C&P Eating Disorders (Mental Disorders) examination worksheet, and
 the AMIE C&P Epilepsy and Narcolepsy examination worksheet and inactivate
 the existing records for these 3 examination worksheets (IEN=203, IEN=204
 and IEN=115) in the AMIE EXAM file (#396.6).  This is done, per request by
 the Veterans Benefits Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office, for
 historical purposes.  The 5th piece of each of the existing records will
 be updated with an "I", indicating Inactive and the 5th piece of each of
 the new records will be updated with an "A", indicating Active.
