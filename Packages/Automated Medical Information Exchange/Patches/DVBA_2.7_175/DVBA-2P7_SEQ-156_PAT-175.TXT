    4. CAPRI - Template Defects
  
      a. The DBQ GYNECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS template has been updated to
         repair the following problem:
  
         When the DBQ GYNECOLOGICAL CONDITIONS template is merged with
         another template, the Veteran's name does not appear on the
         report.  This has been repaired, so that the Veteran's name
         appears on the report.
  
      b. The DBQ INITIAL PTSD template has been updated to repair the
         following problem:
           
         In Section I, question 3d, the sentence is cut off by the text
         box. The text box has been enlarged so that the entire sentence is
         visible.
         
      c. The DBQ MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM CONDITIONS template has been
         updated to repair the following problem:
  
         In Section 1, Diagnosis, there is incorrect embedded logic in the
         blanks for "ICD code" and "Date of diagnosis:" following the
         "Other male reproductive system conditions" selection.  The blanks
         for "ICD code" and "Date of diagnosis" have been removed to
         eliminate the embedded logic.
  
      d. The DBQ PERIPHERAL NERVES CONDITIONS (NOT INCLUDING DIABETIC 
         SENSORY-MOTOR PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY) has been updated to repair
         the following problems:
  
         i. In section 6. Sensory Exam, Upper anterior thigh (L2) question,
            if "Decreased" is checked for "Left", the data for the
            Thigh/knee (L3/4) selection in the same section is incorrect on
            the report. The problem has been repaired so that the correct
            data for Thigh/ knee (L3/4) appears on the report.
  
         ii. When this template was merged with DBQ NECK (CERVICAL SPINE),
             fields were being shared between the templates. VBA has
             advised that the sharing of fields be removed. In order to
             resolve this issue, the template has been modified to not
             share fields between templates.
  
      e. The DBQ WRIST CONDITIONS template has been updated to repair
         the following problem:
        
         In Section 4, Initial Range of Motion (ROM) Measurement, Left
         wrist palmar fexion question, if the "70" is selected, the
         selection will appear while viewing the template, but will not
         appear on the report preview or on the report.  This problem has
         been corrected so that a selection of "70" will appear on the
         template, the report preview, and the report.

    The following section provides pre-installation notes and requirements
    for installing the software.
  
    1. Users On the System
  
     a. CAPRI GUI Users - This patch may be installed while users are
        running the CAPRI GUI.
  
     b. VistA Users - This patch may be installed with users on the
        system, but should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
        disruption to users and to reduce the possibility of errors when
        the routines and file entries are updated.
  
     c. VistA Options - There are no VistA options to disable while
        installing this patch.
  
    2. Software Installation Time
  
       The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off
       peak hours.
  
    3. Required Builds
  
       The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS software
       distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
       without their prior installation.
  
         Required Build(s):
         ------------------
         DVBA*2.7*171
         DVBA*2.7*173
         DVBA*2.7*174
  
    4. This patch has no dependencies with the released patch DVBA*2.7*168
       and can be installed prior to the installation of DVBA*2.7*168.
  
  
 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
     The following section provides the steps for installing the software.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
        the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*175).
  
        a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
           backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
        b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.
  
           CAUTION: Do not use the KIDS "Full Comparison" option. Due to
           the length of some CAPRI Template names, the "Full Comparison"
           option can go into a loop.  This problem has been reported to
           the Kernel developers and will be fixed with patch XU*8*559. The
           "Second line of Routines Only", "Routines only", and "Old style
           Routine compare" options may be used.
  
        c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow 
           you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
           transport global.
  
        d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*175.
  
    5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', answer NO.
  
    6. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
       and Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
  
    7. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA175P is a temporary routine used as
       part of the pre/post-install process and will be automatically
       deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some cases
       Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
       if you discover this at your site.
