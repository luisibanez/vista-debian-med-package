 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v181 and this VistA patch 
    (DVBA*2.7*181).
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. HD0000000605999 - Space Limit in Exam Report Text Window
   
       Problem
       -------
       C&P providers noted that when amending a released C&P exam report
       using the C&P Exam Request Report Management dialog box, the Report
       text field appears to freeze and will not allow additional text to
       be inserted or appended. This occurs most often when editing
       the contents of a merged exam report.
  
       Research determined that the text box has a default limit of approx.
       64,000 characters when text is manually entered.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The MaxLength property of the text box has been set to the approx. 
       2 gigabyte maximum size to override the default 64,000 character
       limit to accommodate the increased size of merged Disability 
       Benefit Questionnaire (DBQ ) templates.
  
  
       b. HD0000000612052 - Clinical Documents search box
   
       Problem
       -------
       The 'Find' field on the Clinical Documents tab returns progress 
       notes that contain the search word and highlights the word.  When
       the user selects a different patient and performs the searches for
       the same word, no results are returned when there are actually
       matching records.  Entering a different search word and then
       reverting to the original search word provides a workaround.
  
       Research determined that the original search word is never cleared
       when the user switches patients.
  
       Solution
       --------
       CAPRI has been modified to clear the search criteria every time the
       user selects a different patient.
  
  
       c. HD0000000623336 - Patient worksheet causing CAPRI to stop
                            responding
  
       Problem
       -------
       A patient with several hundred existing appointments for the same
       clinic may cause CAPRI to hang when a user attempts to sign a
       completed C&P exam. This occurs due to a potential infinite loop
       that may occur when CAPRI retrieves appointment records in batches
       of 50 records at a time.
  
       Solution
       --------
       CAPRI has been modified to retrieve appointment records in a single
       batch.
  
  
   2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed:
  
      a. Defect - Error when entering a lot of data in Review Events window
  
      Problem
      -------
      When several lines of text are added to the Comments field of the
      Review Events dialog box, CAPRI generates an error: "In generation
      of message to server, call to LPack where Length of string of 4
      chars exceeds number of chars for output length (3)".  The error
      appears to occur, because the Comments field provides a horizontal
      scroll bar and does not wrap the text contents.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The Comments field has been modified to display only the vertical
      scrollbar, which forces text to wrap correctly and avoids errors
      when large amounts of text are entered on a single line.      
  
      b. Defect - Potential Access Violation when closing CAPRI with
                  open template window
  
      Problem
      -------
      CAPRI displays a user message warning the user to close any open
      C&P exam templates when exiting CAPRI with an open template.  The
      open template is then displayed.  If the Template form has already
      closed, then CAPRI will generate an Access Violation error.
  
      Solution
      --------
      CAPRI will verify that the Template form is still open before
      attempting to show the Template form.
    
  
   3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
      Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are being
      addressed:
  
      a. Create interface to Virtual VA web service.
  
      This patch addresses a requirement to create an interface between
      CAPRI and the Virtual VA web service. 
  
      This enhancement allows CAPRI users to transmit CAPRI-generated
      documents electronically to the VBA Paperless Delivery Virtual VA
      system.  The elimination of the need to produce paper documents,
      scan, and manually enter them into Virtual VA provides a
      significant efficiency improvement in the veteran claim processing
      workflow.     
  
      b. Align names of CAPRI Templates and exam names
  
      This patch addresses a requirement to make the names of the C&P
      exams which can be selected in the CAPRI GUI more closely match
      the names of the corresponding CAPRI examination templates.
  
      CAPRI uses the VistA  AMIE EXAM file to populate the list of
      selectable exams.  Active DBQ entries in this file are being edited
      to more closely align with CAPRI examination template names.
  
      c. Create an electronic interface to Vocational Rehabilitation
         Chapter 31 VA-Form 28-8861 form.
  
      This CAPRI enhancement allows Vocational Rehabilitation users to
      replace their paper 28-8861 form with a new electronic interface.
      This interface enables users to create an electronic request for
      medical services, track those requests and print reports. The 
      request can be linked to a consult by a VHA Coordinator. Mailman
      notifications are sent to both VR&E Counselor and VHA Coordinator
      when the 28-8861 form status is updated. A nightly background job
      will monitor consults that are linked to the 28-8861 file.
                                                              
      The VR&E personnel security key holders will be able to create new
      28-8861 requests, and cancel them before consults are linked. This
      will result in a real time Mailman notification alerting of the
      28-8861 "new" status to the VHA Coordinator. Both the VHA Coordinator
      and the VR&E personnel will get the "cancelled" status notification.
      Note: When the VHA Coordinator "cancels" a 28-8861 request, it
      must be after the request has been linked to a consult and then
      that consult must be "discontinued." The VHA Coordinator is the
      one who "discontinues" the consult, and that status becomes the
      CPRS status of the consult. That is, a "discontinued" consult CPRS
      status will equate to a "cancelled" 28-8861 status. 
  
      The VHA Coordinator security key holders will be able to link
      consults associated to the 28-8861, resulting in the status of the
      28-8861 changing to pending. This will result in a real time Mailman
      Message and Outlook email notification alerting of the 28-8861 status
      update to both the VHA Coordinator and the VR&E personnel.
  
      A nightly background job will monitor all the 28-8861 pending status
      requests for the status of the consult linked to it in the CPRS
      status field of the consult file. When the CPRS status changes to
      "discontinued" or "complete", the 28-8861 status is updated to
      "cancelled" or "complete". Also, when the 28-8861 status changes, a
      Mailman notification alerting of the 28-8861 status update is sent to
      both the VHA Coordinator and the VR&E personnel.
  
      The background job will also age "new" 28-8861 requests up to 7 days.
      Once the age of "new" 28-8861 statuses reach 5 and 6 days old, a
      Mailman notification is sent to the VHA coordinator alerting them to
      link a consult to the form. But, if the 28-8861 form ages 7 days, an
      Outlook email notification is sent to the VR&E personnel alerting to
      the fact no consult has been linked to the form yet.
  
      The VR&E personnel notified with the Outlook email message is the
      28-8861's point of contact. The VHA coordinator that the Mailman
      message is sent to is listed in the mail group: DVBA VR VOCREHAB
      PERSONNEL.
  
      d. Enterprise Patient/Veteran Search Capability
  
      This enhancement provides the capability to remote CAPRI users to
      search the Master Veteran Index (MVI) for a patient by passing in the
      first name, middle name, last name, social security number, and date
      of birth.  A successful search will return the validated patient
      demographic traits and the patient's list of treating facilities.  
      The search utilizes a HealtheVet Web Services client called by
      remote procedures to connect to the MVI Search Person and the MVI Get
      Corresponding IDs web services.
  
      e. Validate the Patient Restricted List
  
      This enhancement allows the Health Information Access (HIA) staff to
      validate patient demographic traits provided from external sources
      prior to adding patients to the CAPRI Patient Restricted List.  CAPRI
      imports a list of patients in the form of a spreadsheet, calls the
      MVI Search Person web service for each patient, and edits each entry
      in the spreadsheet list to indicate whether the patient is found, not
      found, or has multiple matches found.  CAPRI displays a separate
      dialog to display the total patients screened, the number of valid
      records, the number of invalid records with the associated patient
      traits, and the number of multiple match records with the potential
      matches. The search utilizes a HealtheVet Web Services client called
      by a remote procedure to connect to the MVI Search Person web
      service.
  
      f. CAPRI On-line Help Features
  
      This enhancement offers users access to context-sensitive on-line
      help while using the CAPRI GUI application.  Pressing the F1 key
      will display a Help window containing information related to the
      CAPRI window visible on the user's screen.  The Help window
      provides an index and table of contents.
  
      g. Add Remote Procedure to Support SMART
  
      The Structured Module for Analytic and Report Templates (SMART)    
      application requires the VAFCTFU CONVERT ICN TO DFN remote procedure
      to be added to the DVBA CAPRI GUI menu option in the VistA account.
      SMART is a full extract of the worksheet tab functionality from
      within the CAPRI application. Adding this supported remote procedure
      to the DVBA CAPRI GUI menu option is required to support the Patient
      Context functionality within the SMART application to ensure that the
      correct patient is always displayed to the user.

   1. The following Routines are being added/modified:
  
       a. Modify: DVBABURL
          Description of changes:
          The URL entry point of this routine has been modified to return
          the URL address for the Virtual VA web services server.
          A new VVATOKEN entry point has been added to support the new
          DVBAB GET VVA TOKEN remote procedure.
  
      b. Modify: DVBAB82
          Description of change:

          8861 Request for Medical Services, Chapter 31 Status
          Report.
  
      c. Add: DVBANTFY
          Description of change:
          This routine has been added to trigger a MailMan message to be 
          sent when a "NEW" 8861 request has been submitted and when a 
          consult has been linked to a request, changing the status to
          "PENDING". In addition, when a linked consult or a request is
          cancelled, a MailMan message is sent out.
  
      d. Add: DVBA8861
          Description of change:
          This routine has been added to produce a Form 28-8861 Request
          for Medical Services, Chapter 31 Status Report. Various date 
          ranges can be chosen from a drop down box, as well as the 
          Regional Office, the status to report on and delimited or plain
          text output.
          
      e. Add: DVBAVRX1
          Description of change:
          This routine is the entry point called for the nightly background
          job that determines status changes to the 8861 form. When the
          8861 is determined to be completed or cancelled, a MailMan email
          will be sent to the appropriate staff.
  
          This routine also acts as the entry point for the RPC entry to
          generate MailMan messages that an 8861 form has had a status
          change to New, Pending or Cancelled.
  
      f. Add: DVBAVRX2
          Description of change:
          This routine is an extension of DVBAVRX1 that is processed during
          the nightly background job. The logic contained in this routine
          calculates the number of days old the 8861 request is before 
          having a consult linked to the 8861.
  
          It will send a notification to the appropriate staff based on
          5, 6, or 7 days of aging to alert the users to link the required
          consult.
  
      g. Add: DVBA181P
         Post Init routine DVBA181P will rename all active DBQ entries   
         in the AMIE EXAM file to match the names of the corresponding
         CAPRI examination templates. The renamed AMIE EXAM file entries
         include the body system associated with the exam.
  
      h. Add: DVBAMVI1

          called by the DVBA MVI SEARCH PERSON remote procedure.
  
      i. Add: DVBAMVI2
         Description:
          This new routine creates a 1309 HL7v3 XML message, transmits it
          to the MVI Get Corresponding Ids web service, parses the returned
          1310 HL7v3 XML response, and returns the results.  The routine is
          called by the DVBA MVI GET CORRESPONDING IDS remote procedure.
  
      j. Add: DVBAHWSC
         Description:
          This new routine generates the proxy object on the CLAIMS
          server.  The proxy object is utilized by CAPRI to access
          MVI web services.

   7. The following INTEGRATION CONTROL REGISTRATION's (ICR's) have been
      added or modified.
          
       a. ICR #875 - AMIE was added as a subscriber to this ICR which 
          allows the ORDER STATUS file (#100.01) to be pointed to.
  
       b. ICR #4110 - AMIE was added as a subscriber to this ICR which
          allows access to various fields in the REQUEST/CONSULTATION 
          file (#123).
  
       c. ICR #3552 - AMIE was added as a subscriber to this ICR which
          allows CAPRI to access the $$PARAM^HLCS2 function to retrieve
          the HL7 Default Processing ID.
  
   8. The following MAIL GROUP entry is being added:
     
      a. DVBA VR VOCREHAB PERSONNEL
         VocRehab personnel who should receive Form 28-8861 Notifications
         should be assigned to this group. Users must have access to VistA
         MailMan in order to receive messages.
  
   9. The following SECURITY KEYS have been added:
  
      a. DVBA CAPRI VRE_COUNSELOR
          Anyone needing to see the VocRehab tab within CAPRI will need to
          be assigned the CAPRI VRE Counselor security key.  This key gives
          the user access to all portions of VocRehab except the ability to
          assign a medical consult to a request for medical services.
  
      b. DVBA CAPRI VHA_COORDINATOR
          The CAPRI VHA Coordinator key makes visible within CAPRI a button
          allowing users with this key to assign a medical consult (created
          in CPRS) to a request for medical services.  The only function of
          this security key is allowing the ability to assign consults.  
          Users with this security key will also need the CAPRI VRE
          Counselor security key as well.

       successful completion of the installation, DVBA181P may be manually
       deleted.
  
   11. DVBA VR VOCREHAB PERSONNEL
       The MAIL GROUP, DVBA VR VOCREHAB PERSONNEL will need to have
       users designated as Vocational Rehab personnel assigned to it.
       Note: The Point of Contact is also an Exchange mail recipient and
       will need to be assigned a va.gov email address in the new person
       user file if they do not already have one. These users are the
       VR&E Counselors. The new person file is file #200 and the email
       address field is field number .151.

       be scheduled to start  at least an hour before midnight.    Use the
       Kernel "Schedule/ Unschedule Options" [XUTM SCHEDULE]
       to schedule the background job.
  
   14. Additional information on Post-Install Routine POST^DVBA181P
       The Post-Install Routine for patch DVB*2.7*181, POST^DVBA181P, calls
       two entry points: POST1 and POST2. DVBA181P adds the following
       entries to the PARAMETER DEFINITION File (8989.51):
         DVBAB CAPRI VIRTUALVA PROD URL
         DVBAB CAPRI VIRTUALVA TEST URL
         DVBAB CAPRI VVA PROD PASSWD
         DVBAB CAPRI VVA PROD TOKEN
         DVBAB CAPRI VVA TEST PASSWD
         DVBAB CAPRI VVA TEST TOKEN
         DVBAB CAPRI VVA USER
    
       The POST2 entry point of routine DVBA181P renames all active AMIE
       EXAM file DBQs so that corresponding CAPRI templates and exam names
       match more closely.  The renamed AMIE EXAM file entries indicate the
       body system associated with the exam.
