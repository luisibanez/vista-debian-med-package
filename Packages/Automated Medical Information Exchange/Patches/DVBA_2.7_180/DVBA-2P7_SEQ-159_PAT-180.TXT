 I.  OVERVIEW
  
   This patch is an informational patch that provides instructions that
   must be followed to prevent interruption of CAPRI services for certain
   types of users (Health Revenue Center (HRC)) after user workstations 
   are migrated from Windows XP to Windows 7.
  
  
  
   ************************************************************************
   *  IMPORTANT NOTE - PLEASE READ:                                       *
   *                                                                      *
   *  The procedure described in this patch should NOT be performed for   *
   *  CAPRI users running on Windows XP workstations.                     *
   *                                                                      *
   *  This patch is required only for Windows 7 workstation users that    *
   *  login to the CLAIMS system for initial CAPRI remote access and use  *
   *  the VistA button on the main CAPRI screen to access remote VistA    *
   *  systems with Attachmate Reflection secure shell (SSH) terminal      *
   *  sessions.                                                           *
   *                                                                      *
   *  This patch is NOT required for CAPRI users that login locally to a  *
   *  VAMC VistA system, since CAPRI disables the VistA button for these  *
   *  users.                                                              *

 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
  
   BACKGROUND:
   ----------
     CAPRI implements Attachmate Reflection to provide roll-and-scroll
     secure shell terminal sessions for select users who perform initial
     login through the CLAIMS system.
  
     Prior to launching Reflection, CAPRI searches the directory path that
     contains the CAPRI executable (CAPRI.exe) for an optional plain text 
     configuration file named "CapriTerminalEmulators.ini".  The purpose of
     the configuration file is to specify an alternate path that contains
     the Reflection executable (R2win.exe). If CAPRI does not detect the
     configuration file, then CAPRI assumes that the Reflection executable
     exists in the default Windows XP Reflection installation path:
     "C:\Program Files\Attachmate\Reflection".
  
  
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
   -------------------
     The default installation path for the Reflection executable on
     Windows 7 workstations is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Attachmate\Reflection".
     When a user clicks the VistA button while running CAPRI on a Windows 7
     workstation, CAPRI generates an error dialog message: 
      "Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\Attachmate\Reflection\R2win.exe'.
       Make sure you typed the name correctly, and try again."
  
  
   SOLUTION:
   --------
     Create a "CapriTerminalEmulators.ini" configuration file and enter
     the path used by the Attachmate Reflection installation into the file.
     Place the newly created configuration file in the directory that contains
     the CAPRI executable (CAPRI.exe).  
  
  
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   There are no technical components being exported with this patch. 
  
  
 V. SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL
     
   1. CAPRI Software & User Documentation
  
      a.  The example configuration file and documentation for this
          patch may be retrieved directly using FTP. The preferred method
          is to FTP the files from:
  
             download.vista.med.va.gov
  
         This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.
         Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
         server as follows:
  
         OI&T FIELD OFFICE       FTP ADDRESS                DIRECTORY
         -----------------       -----------                ---------
         Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov   [anonymous.software]

   *                                                                      *
   *  WARNING:                                                            *
   *  DO NOT PERFORM THE PATCH INSTALLATION STEPS FOR CAPRI USERS THAT    *
   *  ARE RUNNING ON THE WINDOWS XP OPERATING SYSTEM.                     *
   *  .                                                                   *
   ************************************************************************
  
   ************************************************************************
   *  NOTE:                                                               *
   *  Sites that run a mixture of Windows XP and Windows 7 workstations   *
   *  and access the CAPRI executable from a central location, such as    *
   *  a share drive or terminal server, must create a new directory on    *
   *  the share to contain the CAPRI executable and the configuration     *
   *  file.  Windows 7 users should access the CAPRI executable from the  *
   *  new directory, while Windows XP users should continue to access     *
   *  the CAPRI executable from the original directory.                   *
   ************************************************************************
  
   1. The example "CapriTerminalEmulators.ini" configuration file provided
      with this patch is configured to provide support for the default
      installation path of Attachmate Reflection on a Windows 7 workstation.
      Place the configuration file in the same folder that contains the
      CAPRI executable.
  
      Alternatively, use the following procedure to create the configuration
      file:
  
      a. Create the configuration file named "CapriTerminalEmulators.ini"
         using a plain text editor, such as Notepad.
  
      b. Populate the configuration file with the following two lines:
         [Config]
         Application=C:\Program Files (x86)\Attachmate\Reflection\R2win.exe
  
      c. Save the file to the Desktop and copy it to the same folder
         that contains the CAPRI executable.
  
   2. Verify that the C:\ProgramData\Attachmate\Reflection folder contains
      a file named ssh_config.  If the file is missing, then copy the 
      ssh_config file provided with this patch to the workstation's
      C:\ProgramData\Attachmate\Reflection folder.  
  
      NOTE: The ProgramData folder is hidden by default in Windows 7.
  
      Use the following procedure to view hidden folders:
      a. Open Folder Options by clicking the Start button, clicking
         Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and
         then clicking Folder Options. 
  
      b. Click the View tab.
  
      c. Under Advanced settings, click Show hidden files and folders,
         and then click OK.
  
   3. Verify that the folder that contains the CAPRI executable (CAPRI.exe)
      contains a file named CAPRISession.r2w file.  If the file is missing,
      then copy the CAPRISession.r2w file provided with this patch to the
      same folder that contains the CAPRI executable.
  
  
 VIII.  TROUBLESHOOTING
  
    Problem:  If this patch has been installed by mistake on a Windows XP
              system, then CAPRI will not be able to find the Reflections
              executable.
  
   Solution:  Delete the "CapriTerminalEmulators.ini" configuration file
              that was added in Step 1 of the installation instructions.
              The files from Step 2 and Step 3 may be left in place.
