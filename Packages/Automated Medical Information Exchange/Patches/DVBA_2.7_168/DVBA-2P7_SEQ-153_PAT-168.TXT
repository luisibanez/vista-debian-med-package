 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v168 and this VistA patch 
    (DVBA*2.7*168).
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. HD0000000398114 - CAPRI hypertension graph inconsistent
   
       Problem
       -------
       The Graph Report functionality on the Vitals tab produces inconsistent
       results when comparing inserted values to the graphed coordinates or
       a written report of Blood Pressure readings. The "value" reading
       does NOT match the lined graph coordinates, or the written report of
       Blood Pressure readings.  
   
       Solution
       --------
       The method used to sort data points on the graph has been modified
       to consistently sort and plot the data points in date order.
  
       b. HD0000000289084 - Template behaving strangely-hourglass/cursor 
                            flutter
   
       Problem
       -------
       The C&P Worksheets tab would cause CAPRI to hang if the name of the
       selected patient duplicated another patient in the patient file and
       both patients were associated with 10 or more CAPRI template exams.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The method used to retrieve exam template lists has been modified to
       limit the data retrieval to the DFN of the selected patient.
  
  
       c. HD0000000424423 - Unable to Perform Specific date range Queries in
                            VistAWeb 
   
       Problem
       -------
       The data entry fields in VistaWeb options that require user entry,
       such as the Date Range field on Med Admin HX (BCMA) screen, do not
       respond to user input.  Research indicated that the accelerator keys
       on the Clinical Documents tab were intercepting the keystrokes.
      
  
       Solution
       --------
       The accelerator key values for the Clinical Documents tab are activated
       only when the Clinical Documents tab is selected.
  
  
       d. HD0000000341272 - CAPRI - Lab Values appearing under the Patients
                            Med Tab  
   
       Problem
       -------
       Selecting "Active Outpatient" from the "Meds" tab of the "Clinical
       Documents" tab returned data for "Lab" at some sites.  Research
       determined the cause of the incorrect data retrieval was due to local
       modifications to the DISPLAY GROUP (#100.98) file. 
  
       Solution
       --------
       The data retrieval method has been modified to perform a lookup on
       the DISPLAY GROUP file and no longer assume a consistent record numbering
       scheme.  This solution is supported by the addition of AMIE to
       Integration Control Reference #873.
  
  
       e. HD0000000420795 - DoD Tab returns "List index out of bounds (316)"
                            error
  
       Problem
       -------
       Retrieving Progress Note data from the Federal Health Information
       Exchange (FHIE) using the DoD Records tab occasionally generated an
       error.  Research indicated that the data records were not always in
       the format expected, preventing CAPRI from determining the end of a
       record.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The data retrieval method has been modified to provide a more robust
       determination of the end of received Progress Note records.
  
  
       f. HD0000000438650 - VBA user can't re-print C&P Exam results for
                            his office
       Problem
       -------
       The "Reprint Final C&P Results" button on the C&P Exam tab incorrectly
       returns a message "Those results do not belong to your office" and fails
       to reprint the results.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The reprint method has been modified to ensure that the user's site 
       identifier is properly set prior to attempting generation of the report.
         
  
       g. HD0000000462290 - 5 Des Moines users cannot access VistA Web 
                            tab in CAPRI
  
       Problem
       -------
       The VistaWeb tab generates the message "ERROR: invalid parameters".
       Research determined that the user's login division from CLAIMS
       is not valid on the VistaWeb system connection.
       
       Solution
       --------
       The VistaWeb connection method has been modified to pass the division
       from the connected remote site.
  
  
       h. HD0000000474181 - CAPRI issue when ordering exams at Omaha
  
       Problem
       -------
       The Routing Location list on the Add New C&P Exam is displayed in
       a different order after a user connects to a different site and
       returns to the original site. 
  
       Solution
       --------
       The method that generates the Routing Location list has been
       modified to consistently retrieve and display the appropriate
       routing locations.     
    
  
       i. HD0000000484927 - Other Facilities visited [WASHINGTON DC] connects
                            to [PUGET SOUND]
  
       Problem
       -------
       Selecting "Washington" from the list generated by the Other Facilities
       Visited button connects the user to Puget Sound.  Research indicated
       that the addition of the City and State to CAPRI Remote site selection
       dialog box affected the existing name matching algorithm used when
       switching sites.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The method used to determine the site selected has been modified to
       provide name matching on the site name prior to adding the City
       and State.
  
       j. HD0000000489731 - Unable to access Capri C&P Training website
                            from GUI help
       Problem
       -------
       Unable to access CAPRI C&P Training website from the CAPRI GUI help.
       User receives the following error:
           Server Error in '/' Application.
  
           The resource cannot be found.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The CAPRI C&P Training website URL has been updated to go to the
       Disability Examination Management Office (DEMO) website where the
       user can use the CAPRI link to access the CAPRI C&P Training.
  
       k. HD0000000474175 - Buffalo user gets errors when entering new patients
  
       Problem
       -------
       Clicking Add Patient when the Last Service Entry Date, Last
       Service Separation Date, Branch of Service, and Type of
       Discharge fields are all unanswered on the Enter New Patient
       dialog box generates an error message stating that "Military
       Service Episode Did Not File Successfully."
  
       Solution
       --------
       The Enter New Patient dialog has been modified to no longer
       generate the "false" error when all 4 of the military service
       episode fields are left unanswered.
  
       l. HD0000000481041 - new DBQ for MH--possible flaws identified
   
       Problem
       -------
       Clicking "Done" on the Template dialog box to complete a merged exam
       that consists of a single History tab generates a false message:
       "You haven't yet clicked on the following sections:".
  
       Solution
       --------
       The method that provides the indication of exam tab activity has been
       modified to correctly update the exam tab status.
  
  
   2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed:
  
      a. Defect - Loading VistA Data pop up screen progress bar shows
                  no activity.
  
      Problem
      -------
      When creating a Special Reports for A&A Pension a pop up screen
      indicating "Loading VistA Data..." appears with a progress bar
      that shows no activity.  This pop up can also be inadvertently
      displayed after the filter criteria selection window appears. 
  
      Solution
      --------
      The wait dialog processing has been moved into the procedure
      that requires user notification and displays 'Updating discharge
      type list x of x' at the bottom of the wait dialog to provide
      progress notification.
  
  
      b. Defect - CAPRI errors when the user's account has no primary
                  menu assigned
       
      Problem
      -------
      CAPRI generates a "Value is not initialized" error on start up
      for CLAIMS users when the user's account does not have a primary
      menu assigned.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The method that determines if a primary menu is assignable has been
      modified to validate the primary menu prior to processing it.
  
  
      c. Defect - CAPRI News window periodically displays flashing
                  yellow and green bar
       
      Problem
      -------
      After accessing Tools and News, the CAPRI News window occasionally
      displays a flashing yellow and green bar instead of the news
      information. Research indicated that the behavior occurs when
      CAPRI is unable to connect to the news server.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The news retrieval and display process has been modified to
      prevent the behavior.
  
      d. Defect - VBA - Exam Request Template loses data after
                       logging out of CAPRI and back in again.
       
      Problem
      -------
      The complete contents of the Contact Info entered on the Exam Request
      Template dialog does not persist from one CAPRI session to another.
      Research determined that the persistence failure occurs when the
      first line of data is over 15 or 20 characters.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The processing of the file (CAPRI.cfg) that persists the Contact
      Info data has been modified to eliminate line length restrictions.
  
  
      e. Defect - CAPRI freezes when CAPRI window is dragged to 
                  bottom and then click on "expanded details"
       
      Problem
      -------
      An exam template "Expanded Details" dialog box becomes
      inaccessible when opened while the title bar of the main
      CAPRI form is at the bottom of the Windows desktop.  The
      inability to interact with the "Expanded Details" leaves
      the application in a "hung" state.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The "Expanded Details" dialog box has been modified to
      open at the center of the screen regardless of the position
      of the main CAPRI form.
  
    
      f. Defect - CAPRI allows VBA to select a division that
                  should be inactive or hidden
       
      Problem
      -------
      The Routing Location list on the View C&P Exam dialog box
      is not filtered by the DISABLE ALL EXAMS? field in the CAPRI
      DIVISION EXAM LIST (#396.15) file.  This allows a user to
      enter a new exam using the filtered routing location list
      on the Add New C&P Exam dialog box and immediately change
      the routing location to an inactive site using the View C&P
      Exam dialog box.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The Routing Location list on the View C&P Exam dialog box
      has been modified to be filtered by the DISABLE ALL EXAMS?
      field.
  
   
      g. Defect - Right hand template navigation button disappears
                  after saving exam with more than 10 templates
  
      Problem
      -------
      The Template dialog box provides right and left navigation buttons
      at both ends of the template name buttons when the total button size
      exceeds the available space.  The buttons work properly when a
      new template is generated, but fail to operate after a template
      has been closed and re-opened.
  
      Solution
      --------  
      The method that processes a re-opened exam has been modified to
      recalculate the template name button size and an event procedure
      has been added to the navigation buttons that supplements the
      scrolling behavior.  
  
  
      h. Defect - "Could not obtain OLE control window handle" application
                  exception error when clicking VistaWeb.
  
      Problem
      -------
      Clicking the "Logout" button on a VistaWeb session running in the 
      CAPRI VistaWeb tab notifies the user that VistaWeb is trying to close
      the browser window.  If the user clicks "OK", then an application error
      is generated when the user clicks on the VistaWeb tab to start a new
      session.
  
      Solution
      --------
      An event procedure was added that prevents VistaWeb from prompting
      the user to close the CAPRI web browser window.
  
  
      i. Defect - Miles no longer appear next to routing locations after
                  closing the Add New C&P Exam dialog box with the close
                  icon ("X").
  
      Problem
      -------
      When a user closes the Add New C&P Exam dialog box with the close
      icon ("X"), CAPRI bypasses critical cancel processing that occurs
      when clicking the "Cancel Request" button.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The close icon ("X") has been removed to prevent the user from
      closing the Add New C&P Exam dialog box without either clicking
      "Cancel Request" or "Send Exam Request".
  
  
   3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
      Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are
      being addressed:
  
      a. CAPRI/AMIE- 
  
      Changes have been made to CAPRI and AMIE to allow for use of
      alphanumeric Regional Office Station Numbers. Previously, all
      Regional Office Station Numbers were numeric.
      1. The 7132 ROUTING LOCATION (#3.5) field of the AMIE REPORT file 
         (#396.2) has been altered to allow storage of alphanumeric
         Regional Office Station Numbers.
      2. Input checks for AMIE options requiring a Regional Office have
         been altered to allow for the input of alphanumeric Station
         Numbers.
  
      b. CAPRI/AMIE -
      The CAPRI "Pending C&P Exam" Report and the AMIE "Pending C&P Exams
      Report" [DVBA C PENDING REPORT] Option Report have been updated to
      include all Exam Statuses following the exam name.
  
      c. CAPRI - 
      The HTMLHelpViewer infrastructure components for Windows HTML
      help has been added to the main CAPRI form to provide support
      for the future addition of application on-line help.
  
      d. CAPRI -  
      The Consolidated Remote Reports dialog box accessed from the Help/
      Consolidated Remote Reports menu option has been enhanced as follows:
  
        1. An "All RO's" checkbox has been added for the AMIS 290 report,
           which when checked, enables the AMIS 290 report to collect data
           for all regional offices at the selected site(s).
  
        2. A "Select Priority of Exam Filter" radio group has been added for
           the AMIS 290 report, which enables the AMIS 290 report results to
           to be filtered by:  "Agent Orange", "Benefits Delivery Discharge/
           Quick Start", "DES Claimed Condition/Fit for Duty", or "All except
           AO, BDD, DCS, DFD, and QS". 
  
  
      e. CAPRI -
      The functionality of the "VistA" button at the bottom right of the main
      CAPRI form has been modified to provide terminal session connections
      using either an Attachmate "Reflection for Unix and OpenVMS" session 
      window that utilizes a secure shell connection or the original telnet
      connection window.  A dialog box displays 'Do you wish to use Reflection
      to launch a secure shell session?' after clicking the "VistA" button.
      If the user selects 'YES', then CAPRI will launch an Attachmate secure 
      shell connection.  If the user selects 'NO', then CAPRI will launch the 
      original telnet connection window.  This enhancement will only impact 
      users who connect and authenticate through the CLAIMS server and 
      currently have access to the "VistA" button.
  
    *************************************************************************
    * NOTE: Some users with slow Reflection session startup may experience
    *       an auto-login failure when CAPRI starts the Reflection session, 
    *       because the token utilized to authenticate the user expires in
    *       20 seconds.  A new Kernel patch XU*8*573 LENGTHEN TIME FOR TOKEN
    *       SIGNON will address the token expiration problem by lengthening
    *       the life span of the token to 2 minutes.
    *************************************************************************

          Management Office (DEMO) URL of http://vaww.demo.va.gov/ rather 
          than http://vaww.demo.va.gov/capri/capri.aspx . The higher level 
          URL should be more stable and require less frequent changes.
