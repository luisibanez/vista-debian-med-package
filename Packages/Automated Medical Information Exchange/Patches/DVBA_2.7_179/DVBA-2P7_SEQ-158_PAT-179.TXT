 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v179 and this VistA patch 
    (DVBA*2.7*179).
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. HD0000000131110 - CAPRI E/M Forwarding Address Not Working
   
       Problem
       -------
       The email address entered using the Tools/Change Forwarding Address
       option in CAPRI is never used by VistA to provide notification of
       significant 2507 exam request changes.
  
       Solution
       --------
       This issue is resolved by the Notification and Tracking of Changes
       to Exam Request Status enhancement in section 3. b. of this patch
       description. 
  
       b.  HD0000000585077 - Tab control access error - Violation occured
  
       Problem
       -------
       CAPRI generates a "Tab control access error" when a user clicks on
       the Clinical Documents tab, clicks on a different tab and quickly
       clicks back to the Clinical Documents tab.  The error occurs
       because the processing of the previous tab click has not completed.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The tab control logic has been modified to disable the tab control
       temporarily while the tab click logic is being executed.  The tab
       control is re-enabled immediately upon completion of the tab click
       logic to prevent duplicate triggering.
  
       c.  HD0000000554852 - Cannot copy from 2507 screen except with edit
                             menu
  
       Problem
       -------
       When a user attempts to copy text from the Exam Results field of the
       Exam Detail form using the Ctrl-C hotkey, CAPRI generates an error.
       The user workaround is to use the Edit menu prior to using Ctrl-C.
       Also, the Exam Results field does not provide a popup edit menu when
       clicking the right mouse button on the field.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The Exam Results field has been modified to properly initialize the
       copy function immediately after the user clicks the field.  A popup
       edit menu containing Copy and Select All options has been added to
       the Exam Results field.
  
  
   2. The following defects that were reported directly to the CAPRI
      development team are being addressed:
  
      a. Defect - "AUDIO" template name displays when selecting "BLANK"
                   template.
  
      Problem
      -------
      When a user adds two templates from the "Available Templates"
      list on the "Browse Templates" form, deletes the first template by
      double-clicking in the "Selected Templates" list, and clicks
      "Generate Template", CAPRI displays the deleted template's
  
      name in the "Template Name" field on the C&P Worksheets tab list.
      This behavior occurs because CAPRI does not update the internal
      selected items list when a template is deleted from the "Selected
      Templates" list.
  
      Solution
      --------
      Modify CAPRI to update the internal selected items list every time
      a template is deleted from the "Selected Templates" list.
  
  
      b. Defect - Intermittent horizontal scrolling issues when a large
                  number of exam templates are merged.
  
      Problem
      -------
      When a large number of templates are merged, the total length of
      the template selection buttons that activate each template exceed
      the available space on the template form and some buttons become
      hidden.  The scroll control that enables the user to access the
      hidden button does not function reliably and prevents the user
      from accessing the hidden template selection buttons.
  
      Solution
      --------
      The scroll control has been replaced with a scroll bar that displays
      immediately below the row of template selection buttons when the total
      length of the buttons exceeds the available space. 
  
  
      c. Defect - Switching sites after using VistaWeb causes print problem
  
      Problem
      -------
      CAPRI retains the VistaWeb tab as the active tab instead of resetting
      the active tab to C&P Exams when a user accesses VistaWeb, immediately
      switches sites, and does not select a patient at the new site. This
      causes the File/Print option to attempt to print VistaWeb data from
      the patient at the previous site.
  
      Solution
      --------
      CAPRI has been modified to set the active tab to C&P Exams whenever
      a user switches sites whether a patient is selected or not at the new
      site.
  
    
   3. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
      Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) and/or
      Health Revenue Center (HRC) are being addressed:
  
      a. Add Medication Profile and Refill Option to CAPRI/HRC Menus.
  
      This patch addresses a request made by the HRC to add the Medication 
      Profile and Refill [PSO HRC PROFILE/REFILL] option to the existing
      CAPRI menus, HRC Pharmacy Menu [DVBA HRC MENU PHARMACY] and
      HRC Pharmacy Customer Care Menu [DVBA HRC MENU PHARMACY CC].
    
      This change will allow Pharmacy Customer Care agents at the HRC to
      view a medication profile and to request refills for prescriptions
      on behalf of the patient they are serving. Adding this option to the
      HRC menus will assist the HRC in providing 'first call resolution'
      to veterans.
  
  
      b. Notification and Tracking of Changes to Exam Request Status 
  
      Changes have been made to CAPRI to send notification email messages
      to the original requestor of a 2507 exam request when the exam
      request is canceled or when the exam request is released to the
      regional office, but not yet printed.
  
      A new Request Status by Date Range report has been added to the
      CAPRI Reports dialog box.  This report sorts by the last date
      that the request status changed.  The user selects a date
      range of status changes to include in the report. A status filter
      value may also be selected that will cause the report to only return
      records with the selected status. The report defaults to 'All Statuses'.
      The user may choose the output format as plain text format for printing
      or delimited format for import into external programs.
  
      The new Request Status by Date Range report depends on a new
      DATE STATUS LAST CHANGED (#7) field in the 2507 REQUEST (#396.3) file.
      This patch will automatically populate the field for 2507 REQUEST
      records that have been entered in the last 90 days.
      
       
      c. Modify CAPRI Reports to Improve Data Collection Performance
      
      Certain CAPRI reports were originally designed to collect data by
      making a separate call to the database for each date in a date range.
      This design results in increased wait times for the data collection
      to complete.  The reports have been re-designed to collect all data
      for the date range with a single call to the database.  The following
      reports have been re-designed:
         * Admission Report for SC Veterans
         * Re-admission Report
         * Discharge Report
         * Incompetent Veterans Report
  
  
      d. Priority of Exam Dropdown Box Size Increase and Sort
  
      The CAPRI IPT requested modifications to the dropdown box that displays
      the Priority of Exam list on the Add New C&P Exam form and the View
      C&P Exam form.  The length of the dropdown box has been increased to
      display all available exam priorities without the use of a scrollbar.
      The available exam priorities will now be sorted in ascending alphabetic
      order.
  
      e. Add CLAIMS.FORUM.VA.GOV to the remote mode server list
  
      CAPRI automatically runs in remote mode when a user connects to
      the CLAIMS server with the name FORUM.VA.GOV. The CLAIMS server
      name is being changed to CLAIMS.FORUM.VA.GOV. This patch adds
      CLAIMS.FORUM.VA.GOV as a valid remote mode server.
  
    
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   The following section describes the technical components being exported
   with this patch.

   1. The following Routines are being added/modified:
  
       a. Modify: DVBAB1
          Description of change:
          This routine has been modified to send email notifications to a
          requestor of a 2507 Request when the request has been either
          canceled or completed, but not printed.
  
       b. Modify: DVBAB82
          Description of change:
          This routine has been modified to add the new Request Status
          by Date Range report.
  
       c. Modify: DVBARSBD
          Description of changes:
          This new routine implements the new Request Status by Date
          Range report.  It collects 2507 REQUEST (#396.3) file records
          that have a DATE STATUS LAST CHANGED within a selected date range.
          The record data for each record is formatted into rows and
          returned to CAPRI for display and printing.  The routine is called
          by DVBAB82.
  
       d. Modify: DVBAB51
          Description of changes:
          This routine generates the Incompetent Patient Report and
          has been modified to replace the report output local array with a
          temporary global. The RPC Broker now makes one call to VistA to
          process the entire date range. This new method of data gathering
          speeds up the report processing considerably.
  
       e. Modify: DVBAB53
          Description of changes:
          This routine generates the Discharge Report and has been modified
          to replace the report output local array with a temporary global.
          The RPC Broker now makes one call to VistA to process the entire
          date range. This new method of data gathering speeds up the
          report processing considerably.
  
       f. Modify: DVBAB54
          Description of changes:
          This routine generates the Admission Report and has been modified
          to replace the report output local array with a temporary global.
          The RPC Broker now makes one call to VistA to process the entire
          date range. This new method of data gathering speeds up the
          report processing considerably.
  
       g. Modify: DVBAB56 and DVBAB98
          Description of changes:
          These routines generate the Re-admission Report and have been
          modified to replace the report output local array with a
          temporary global. The RPC Broker now makes one call to VistA to
          process the entire date range. This new method of data gathering
          speeds up the report processing considerably.
  
  
   2.  The following file is being modified:
    
       a. 2507 REQUEST (#396.3)
  
          Field 7, DATE STATUS LAST CHANGED, is a new field that contains
          the date of the last REQUEST STATUS (#17) value change.  The 
          field is automatically populated by a new trigger on the REQUEST
          STATUS field.
  
          Field 17, REQUEST STATUS, has been modified to add a trigger that
          populates the DATE STATUS LAST CHANGED field when the REQUEST
          STATUS changes.
  
  
   3.  The following REMOTE PROCEDUREs are being modified:
  
       a. DVBAB SEND MSG
          An additional input parameter (VAL5) of type 'literal' has been
          added to contain the 2507 REQUEST IEN.
  
       b. DVBAB REPORT INCOMPVET
          The RETURN VALUE TYPE has been changed to GLOBAL ARRAY and WORD 
          WRAP ON now equals TRUE.
  
       c. DVBAB REPORT DISCHARGE
          The RETURN VALUE TYPE has been changed to GLOBAL ARRAY and WORD 
          WRAP ON now equals TRUE.
  
       d. DVBAB REPORT READMIT
          The RETURN VALUE TYPE has been changed to GLOBAL ARRAY and WORD 
          WRAP ON now equals TRUE.
  
       e. DVBAB REPORT ADMISSIONS 
          The RETURN VALUE TYPE has been changed to GLOBAL ARRAY and WORD 
          WRAP ON now equals TRUE.
  
  
   4.  The following OPTIONS are being added:
  
       a. The Outpatient Pharmacy option Medication Profile and Refill 
          [PSO HRC PROFILE/REFILL] will be added to the HRC Pharmacy Menu

         The Health Revenue Center (HRC) will be using a special telnet feature
         in CAPRI-Remote.  This allows a user to be automatically logged into
         the local VistA system and provides access to the site's regular VistA 
         functionality.  The HRC requires access to the menu options listed
         in this Integration Agreement in order to access various records for
         a given patient.  
     
         HRC First Party Call Center contact representatives will use the HRC 
         Pharmacy Menu [DVBA HRC MENU PHARMACY] option to handle calls from 
         veterans related to the Consolidated Co-payment Processing Center
         (CCPC)  billing statements.  The menu option will be available through
         the CAPRI application, which provides local common service to VistA
         for HRC CAPRI remote users.  Users of the HRC Pharmacy Menu [DVBA HRC
         MENU PHARMACY] option will typically be licensed and registered
         personnel (i.e. pharmacists and pharmacy technicians).  
     
         NOTES

    8. If CAPRI GUI users have not already been upgraded to the new 
       version of the CAPRI GUI v179 (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P179_06.ZIP]), 
       they should be upgraded as soon as possible upon installation of 
       this patch.
  
    9. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA179P is a temporary routine used as
       part of the pre/post-install process.  This routine will not be
       automatically deleted by KIDS after patch installation. After successful
       completion of the TaskMan task that populates the new DATE STATUS LAST
       CHANGED (#7) field of the 2507 REQUEST (#396.3) file, the routine may
       be manually deleted.
  
    Additional information on Post-Install Routine POST^DVBA179P
    ==========================================================================
    The Post-Install Routine for patch DVB*2.7*179, POST^DVBA179P, makes a call
    to two entry points: POST1 and POST2.
  
    The POST1 entry point of routine DVBA179P adds menu items to two of the
    HRC menus distributed in a previous patch.
  
    The POST2 entry point of routine DVBA179P automatically queues a TaskMan
    task that will populate the new DATE STATUS LAST CHANGED (#7) field in the
    2507 REQUEST (#396.3) file with the most recent activity date for any
    record that was entered in the last 90 days.  Limiting the number of 
    records to those entered in the last 90 days provides the most business
    value with the least impact on the VistA system resources.
  
    Even though the expected number of records should be small (< 5000), the
    field population task contains checks for a user-requested stop. A MailMan
    message will be created and sent to the person installing the patch
    indicating the reason for premature task stoppage.
  
    To re-queue a "stopped" field population task, re-run the POST2 entry point
    of routine DVBA179P by entering at the programmer's prompt:
  
    > D POST2^DVBA179P
  
    Successful completion of the field population task results in a MailMan
    message being  created and sent to the person installing the patch.
