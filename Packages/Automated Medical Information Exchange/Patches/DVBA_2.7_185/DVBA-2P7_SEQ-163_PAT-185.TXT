============

 I. OVERVIEW
  
    This patch (DVBA*2.7*185) and CAPRI GUI v185 provides defect fixes and
    enhancements for the CAPRI GUI and the Automated Medical Information
    Exchange (AMIE) package.  Please refer to the 'FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW'
    section (III) for the specific changes and primary functionality being
    delivered.
  
    VHAVACO is requesting this additional functionality.
  
    This patch introduces enhancements to the AUTOMATED MED INFO EXCHANGE
    (AMIE) V 2.7 package in support of the new CAPRI Contract Referral
    (CCR) dialog. The changes introduced in this patch will allow VistA
    systems to communicate with the CCR GUI dialog.
  
    The VA Disability Examination Management Contract project will contract
    with non-VA care providers to perform disability examinations.
    Referring examinations to these external providers will require new
    processes by the organization to assign, track and report on these
    types of disability examinations. 
  
    CCR - Background
  
       The CCR dialog will be used within the Disability Clinics of 
       the VAMC's or Military Installations to facilitate referral of 
       disability exams to vendors who have been awarded contracts through
       the Disability Examination Management Contract (DEM). Initially 
       there will be five DEM Contractors who will receive examination
       referrals. Most facilities will have no more than three DEM 
       Contractors servicing the clinic.
  
  
 II. ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS & NEW SERVICE REQUESTS
   
    The following section lists the Remedy tickets and/or New Service 
    Requests associated with this patch.
   
    1. INC000000842748 - Messages sent using the "review
        edit option" in CAPRI lose their carriage returns
  
         Duplicates:     None
  
    2. INC000000397878 - Date of Note in TIU is wrong;
        seems to come from another patient's appointment
   
         Duplicates:     INC0000000594245
  
  
 III. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
   
    The following is an overview of the changes and primary functionality
    that will be delivered in CAPRI GUI v185 and this VistA patch 
    (DVBA*2.7*185).
    
    1. The following Remedy tickets are being addressed:
   
       a. INC0000000842748 - Messages sent using the "review events" option
       in CAPRI lose their carriage returns
  
       Problem   
       -------
       When messages are sent using the "review events" option, they lose 
       there carriage returns and the lines of the message run together.
  
       Solution
       --------
       The GUI Comments memo box, "FMMemoStyle", property was changed from
       msWrapped to msByLines.
  
       b. INC0000000397878 - Date of Note in TIU is wrong
    
       Problem
       -------
       The Date of Note in TIU is wrong and seems to come from another 
       patient's appointment. This is likely related to remedy ticket 
       INC000000397878. It was discovered while working on INC000000594245.
       
       Solution
       --------
       Clear out the Appointment Pointer IEN (anuApptPointer) and the 
       Visit ID IEN (VisitIDIEN) when creating a TIUNote to assure that
       nothing is left over from a previous patient visit.
        
    2. The following enhancements that were requested by Veterans Health
       Administration Veterans Affairs Central Office (VHAVACO) are being
       addressed:
  
       a.   Integrate the functionality created for the CCR dialog
            as a new module within CAPRI.  The new module will be referred
            to as the "CAPRI Contract Referral module" (CCR).  The CCR
            module will be accessible through an option on the CAPRI Tools
            menu. Selecting this option on the Tools menu will open a new
            window that allows the user to toggle between the CAPRI window
            and the CCR module window (in essence an application embedded
            within an application).
  
       b.   CAPRI currently displays a fixed-size window for displaying
            a template. CAPRI has been modified to incorporate a new
            version of PNCS, which supports the ability to increase the
            vertical size of the template display window, allowing for
            more vertical screen real estate. This change will dramatically
            change the user perception of the template and increase overall
            usability.
  
       c.   The exam priority value (e.g., Initial SC, Initial NSC, POW,
            etc.) has been added to the exam status e-mail. An email will
            now be created for each complete exam, in addition to the
            e-mail created for each completed 2507 request.
  
       d.   Added the ability for CAPRI to create a comma delimited file
            for the following reports: Pending C&P Exams, Pending C&P Exams
            on Consolidated Remote Reports menu, Insufficient Exam Report,
            Pending Form 7131 Requests, Request Status By Date Range,
            Exam Requests by Date Range, Admission Report for SC Veterans,
            Admission Inquiry By Date, Special Report for A&A/Pension,
            Discharge Report, CNH Report of Admissions/Discharges,
            Re-Admission Report, CNH Stays in Excess of 90 Days, CNH
            Roster Print, Incompetent Veterans Report, & Template
            Activity. 
  
        e.  Add a question to the CAPRI Signature Validation screen that
            controls whether to treat this exam request as a C&P exam or
            a non-C&P exam (for instance, if a veteran takes a DBQ to
            their Primary Care Provider w/o a C&P exam request on file).
            If answered "yes", CAPRI will maintain its current
            functionality.  If answered "no", CAPRI will not filter the
            Note Title list (i.e. will display all titles), hide the
            section allowing the user to tie the exam back to an AMIE
            2507 request, thus only creating the progress note for
            storage in the TIU Documents file.
  
       f.   CAPRI patch 184 includes "Get Docs From Virtual VA"
            functionality. This functionality is visible and available
            to all users of CAPRI.  The business requires the ability to
            turn this functionality on or off on a per-user basis.  The
            ability to add/remove options is something that CAPRI already
            does with other features (e.g., "Edit Site List Parameters 
            MAS," "Edit Remote User Site Lists," etc.) Adding a security
            key that will deny access to the "Get Docs from Virtual VA" 
            from the CAPRI tools menu option.
  
       g.   Virtual VA Change Request - Modify 'Restricted Access Message' 
            For document type 10, PGF docs, and document type 11, IVM 
            docs, when the user clicks on the "restricted document" or
            "view selected document", a message will display stating
            "Fiduciary Document- Access Not Permitted" and "Federal Tax
            Information- Access Not Permitted" respectively.  This message
            will display in any case in which these documents are
            selected.  The user's security key assignment will have no 
            bearing on the message received.
  
       h.   Pending report names are missing in the Items Pending 
            section of the Pending Form 7131 Requests report.  They need to
            be displayed/printed.
     
  
    3. New Security Keys for CCR
  
       a.   DVBA CONTRACTED EXM SPRVSR
  
            Designated administrators of the CCR contract should be
            assigned this security key which allows them to execute the
            following restricted processes within the CCR application:
            
               - Add/Edit Contractor entries within the 2507 EXAM
                 CONTRACTORS (#396.45) file.
               - Delete Check-Out of exam to contractor
               - Edit Exam Check-In
  
       b.   DVBA CONTRACTED EXM CCRUSR
            
            This security key will allow the CAPRI user access to the CCR
            dialog. The CCR dialog options menu selection is located under
            the CAPRI menu option Tools/CAPRI Contract Referral (CCR). 
            Without this key, CAPRI users will not see the option.
            Users with this key will have access to all options except
            the CCR menu option "Admin Tools".
  
         
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    4. New Security Key for Virtual VA      
  
       a.   DVBA CAPRI DENY_GETVBADOCS
  
            When the CAPRI user is assigned the DVBA CAPRI
            DENY_GETVBADOCS security key, the user will be denied access
            to the "Get Docs from Virtual VVA" from the CAPRI tools menu
            option. Note: If the user doesn't have the key assigned, the
            user can see "Get Docs from Virtual VA" from within CAPRI.
            This security key works in a manner opposite to the way most
            other security keys do. All users who should not see all
            documents from within CAPRI should be assigned this security
            key.
  
    5. 2507 EXAM (#396.4) file changes:
  
       To support the DEM contract, the following fields will be added
       to the 2507 EXAM (#396.4) file to support the tracking of these
       external exams within the CRR GUI:
  
          - 100 : CONTRACTOR - Pointer to the new 2507 EXAM CONTRACTORS
                  (#396.45) file.
          - 101 : DATE TRANSFERRED TO CONTRACTOR - Date/Time Field when 
                  the 2507 exam was sent to the contractor.
          - 102 : DATE RECEIVED FROM CONTRACTOR - Date/Time Field when 
                  the 2507 exam was received back from the contractor.
  
    6. 2507 EXAM CONTRACTORS (#396.45) - Addition of New File:
  
       To support the DEM contract, the following new file, 2507 EXAM
       CONTRACTORS (#396.45), will be added to store contractor 
       information and to track whom the patient's 2507 exams were 
       contracted out to.
  
       This file will be updated (editing existing entries and adding new
       ones) on the CLAIMS server using Fileman. The process for updating a
       contractor is as follows:
  
          (1) CAPRI IPT submits request for the addition of a new
              vendor or update to existing vendor
          (2) CAPRI team gets approval from the VA OI&T ESE; or in
              instances where CAPRI/IT staff is unavailable BEST will
              serve as backup 
          (3) DMA sends out a notification to the field 
          (4) Change is made via Fileman.
  
        Note:
  
          #396.45 has two sections. The first part is data that is 
          stored on the "Remote" server. The second part is the data
          that is stored on the "Local" server.
          The CLAIMS server is called "Remote" server. The Remote
          server holds each vendor's SFTP connection info in an
          encrypted format. All other servers are called "Local"
          servers, i.e. the server/station in which a user logs in.
          Each station will have its own data in this file. Each
          station for every local vendor ID, will cross-reference to
          the Remote, i.e. national listing of vendors, by the ID
          number of each vendor on the Remote server.
  
    7. The following Remote Procedures have been added:
  
        a. NAME: DVBAD CONTRACTED EXAM REPORTS
   
           This RPC allows users in the CCR dialog to request and retrieve
           results for the following contracted reports:
  
             - DETAILED
             - SUMMARY
             - TIMELINESS
  
        b. NAME: DVBAD CONTRACTED EXAM CRYPTO
  
           This RPC allows the CCR dialog to Encrypt/Decrypt sensitive and
           confidential information.
  
        c. NAME: DVBAB SEND MSG TWO
  
           This RPC is the second for the CAPRI MSG 2507 exam. It produces
           a message for each exam that is completed.
  
    8.  The following Routines have been added: 
  
        a. DVBACER1
  
           Provides the implementation for the Detailed, Summary and 
           Timeliness reports that CCR can execute.
  
        b. DVBACEM1
  
           Provides the implementation for encrypting/decrypting sensitive
           and confidential information that CCR can execute within the
           DVBAD CONTRACTED EXAM CRYPTO RPC.
  
        c. DVBAB1A
  
           This routine is an email driver for the CAPRI 2507 exam complete
           status email notification mailer.
  
  
 IV. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
  
   The following section describes the technical components being exported
   with this patch.

   NOTE: File #396.45 is a new file that will be created upon installation
           of this patch. No data will be included in this file.
  
  
    1. The following Routines are being added/modified:
  
       a. Modify: DVBASPD2
                  DVBAB53
                  DVBAB98
                  DVBAB85
                  DVBAB54
                  DVBAB82
                  DVBAB82D
                  DVBAB5

                  DVBCIRPT
                  DVBCIUTL
  
           Description of changes:
           These routines are being modified to enable existing reports to
           output to a comma delimited file format. Those reports which
           previously had the ability to export the report data using a
           "^" delimited file format have been updated to use the MS Excel
           standard comma delimited file format (.csv). Reports that did
           not have the ability to export data to Excel now utilize the
           comma delimited file format for export. For a complete list of
           the reports, see Section III.3.d above.
  
       b. New: DVBAB1A
           Description:
           This new routine will create an email notification alerting the
           user of the completion of an exam and the number of exams
           remaining on a request. If the request is complete, that status
           will be noted as well. The Priority of Exam has been added to 
           the information included in this alert. Previously, users
           received an alert only when the entire list of exams on a
           request was completed.
         
       c. New: DVBACER1  CCR: Driver routine for printing Contracted
                         reports.
               DVBACEM1  CCR: Driver routine for encrypting/decrypting
                         information.
            
       d. New: DVBA185P  CCR: Post-installation routine to add an entry to 
                         the Remote Application file (#8994.5) for CCR-
                         CAPRI that contains contractor/vendor information
                         which, when queried, will complete the request for
                         a 2507 exam referral to a contractor.
  
    2.  The following REMOTE PROCEDURES entries are being added/modified
        (#8994) file:
  
        a. Modified: 
  
            DVBAB TEMPLATE REPORT FULL
            DVBAB PENDING C&P REPORT
            DVBAB REPORT ADMISSIONS
            DVBAB REPORT DISCHARGE
            DVBAB REPORT INCOMPVET
            DVBAB REPORT READMIT
            DVBAB REPORT PENDING7131
            DVBAB REPORT SPECIAL
            DVBAB REPORTS
            DVBAB EXAMS BY DATE
  
            INPUT PARAMETER: DVBADLMTR   
             For each of these RPCs, the delimiter was either added
             or modified to allow comma delimited output.
  
        b.  Added:
  
            DVBAD CONTRACTED EXAM REPORTS
            DVBAD CONTRACTED EXAM CRYPTO
            DVBAB SEND MSG TWO    
  
    3.  The following option has been updated in the OPTION (#19) file:
  
        a. NAME: DVBA CAPRI GUI
           MENU TEXT: Capri GUI (Broker)
           DESCRIPTION:
           This is the 'B' type option used by CAPRI GUI client
           application. It contains all the RPCs used by the CAPRI
           GUI application.  
  
    4.  The following new security keys will be added to the SECURITY KEY
        (#19.1) file:
  
         NAME: DVBA CONTRACTED EXM SPRVSR
         NAME: DVBA CONTRACTED EXM CCRUSR

 VI. INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS/NOTES:
  
    1. Users On the System
  
       a. This patch (DVBA*2.7*185) may be installed while CAPRI users are
          still using the previously released version of the CAPRI GUI
          (i.e. DVBA_27_184.exe).
  
       b. Once the installation of this patch has been completed, CAPRI
          users should be upgraded to the new released version of the CAPRI
          GUI (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P185_11.ZIP]). Please refer to the
          CAPRI_GUI_ISG.doc document within the DVBA_27_P185_11.zip file
          for supplemental installation instructions regarding the
          installation of the following files:
              VACAPRIVVA.dll        Virtual VA dynamically linked library
              CAPRI_Help.chm        CAPRI On-line Help
              CAPRI.map             CAPRI error map
              CAPRISession.r2w      Reflections session configuration
              ssh_config            Secure Shell configuration
  
       c. This patch modifies routines used by the CAPRI GUI application 
          and the Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) package. It
          should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize disruption 
          to users and to reduce the possibility of errors when the
          routines are updated.
  
    2. VistA Options
         
       a. The following VistA options should be disabled while installing
          this patch: NONE.
  
    3. Software Installation Time
  
       a. The estimated installation time for VistA patch DVBA*2.7*185 is 
          less than 5 minutes during off peak hours.
   
    4. Required Builds
  
       a. The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
          distribution (DVBA*2.7*185). KIDS will not allow the installation
          of this patch without their prior installation.
  
          Required Builds:
          ----------------
          DVBA*2.7*184
  
 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
    2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
    3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*185).
  
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*185.
  
    5. If prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
       Install? NO//', respond NO.
  
    6. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', it is recommended you answer NO.
  
    7. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? NO//', respond NO.
  
    8. If CAPRI GUI users have not already been upgraded to the new 
       version of the CAPRI GUI v185 (CAPRI.exe [DVBA_27_P185_11.ZIP]), 
       they should be upgraded as soon as possible upon installation of 
       this patch.
  
    9.  NOTE: Post-install routine DVBA185P is a temporary routine used
        as part of the post-install process. This routine will not be
        automatically deleted by KIDS after patch installation. After
        verifying that CCR-CAPRI is listed in the Remote Application file 
        (#8994.5), you may manually delete this routine.
