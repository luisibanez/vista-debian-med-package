   1. Users On the System
   
    a. CAPRI GUI Users - This patch may be installed while users are
       running the CAPRI GUI.  
  
    b. VistA Users - This patch may be installed with users on the
       system, but should be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize
       disruption to users and to reduce the possibility of errors when
       the routines and file entries are updated.
  
    c. VistA Options - There are no VistA options to disable while
       installing this patch.
  
   2. Software Installation Time
   
    a. The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off 
       peak hours.
  
   3. Required Builds
  
    a. The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS software
       distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
       without their prior installation.
  
        Required Build(s):
        ------------------
        DVBA*2.7*143
        DVBA*2.7*161
  
 VII. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  
    The following section provides the steps for installing the software.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
  
   2. From the 'Kernel Installation & Distribution System' menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
   3. From this menu, you may now elect to use the following options (when
      prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DVBA*2.7*163).
  
       a. Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
          backup any changes such as DDs or templates.
  
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed. 
  
          CAUTION: Do not use the KIDS "Full Comparison" option. Due to 
          the length of some CAPRI Template names, the "Full Comparison"
          option can go into a loop.  This problem has been reported to 
          the Kernel developers. The "Second line of Routines Only", 
          "Routines only", and "Old style Routine compare" options may be
          used.
  
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow you
          to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the transport
          global.
  
       d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
  
   4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select package DVBA*2.7*163.
  
   5. When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', answer NO.
  
   6. When prompted to 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
      and Protocols? NO//', answer NO.
  
   7. NOTE: Pre/Post-init routine DVBA163P is a temporary routine used as
      part of the pre/post-install process and will be automatically
      deleted by KIDS after patch installation. However, in some cases
      Cache doesn't always delete the routine. You may delete it manually
      if you discover this at your site.
