     HD0000000392573    page break issues with Linux    
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When certain reports are compiled to be displayed in CAPRI they are
 temporarily written to a scratch file.  On Linux systems, when the
 data is being retrieved/read from the scratch file the Form Feeds 
 or page breaks are interpreted as a carriage return and the page 
 breaks do not occur.  The standard value for a Page Break is
 typically written as a "#" sign.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After the scratch file is opened, IOF, which is the code to start output
 at the top of a page, will be modified to reset the page position and 
 insert the page break flag.  This will ensure that page breaks occur where
 intended.  Routine modified: DVBAB82
  
 2)  HD0000000423218    Extra pages print between exams
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When multiple exams are tied to a single 2507 request an unwanted blank
 page prints after each exam due to incorrect page formatting. 
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine will be modified to correctly format the pages, preventing extra
 pages from printing.  Routine modified: DVBCRPR1.
