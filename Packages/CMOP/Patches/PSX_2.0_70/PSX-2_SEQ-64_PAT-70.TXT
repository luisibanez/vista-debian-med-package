Category:

  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains software modifications to the Consolidated Mail 
 Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) V. 2.0 application to support the Food and Drug
 Administration (FDA) Medication Guides - Increment 3 project. The project
 objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication Guide
 for prescription items that contain FDA approved information that can help
 patients avoid adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication Guides be
 included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products when the
 Agency determines that:
  
  . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
  . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
    serious side effect with a product, or 
  . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
    to its effectiveness. 
  
 The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
 incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 3 release, which
 is the last planned release. The features included in this release are:
  
  . Ability to create and maintain a list of FDA Medication Guide printers
    for a specific pharmacy division.
  
  . Automatic printing of the FDA Medication Guide along with prescription
    labels on designated FDA Medication Guide printers without any direct
    user interaction. 
  
  . Ability to enable or disable the automatic printing of the FDA
    Medication Guide by pharmacy division.
  
  . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide when reprinting a 
    prescription label.
  
  . Ability to change the FDA Medication Guide printer at any point of the
    dispensing process, similar to changing the label printer.
  
  . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide for any given prescription
    fill or the latest FDA Mediation Guide available for the medication on
    the prescription.
   
  . Display on the prescription label that an FDA Medication Guide is
    available, and if printed, needs to accompany the documentation before
    being given to the patient.
  
  . Changes to the prescription label activity logs showing which specific
    FDA Medication Guide document printed along with the label.
  
  . Changes to the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) Event log
    showing which specific FDA Medication Guide document was available 
    for the medication when the prescription fill was transmitted to CMOP.
  
  . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
    automatic printing of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
    software does not require any direct user interaction. The software 
    identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide
    and automatically sends it to the FDA Medication Guide printer
    selected by the user within VistA when dispensing the medication.
  
  . Ability to update the Windows network printer name for a specific
    device through the Kernel application. Once the pharmacist selects a
    printer to print the FDA Medication Guide Vista will retrieve the 
    Windows name for the printer and will pass it on to the Java
    application responsible for printing the document.
