Subject: SCHEDULING ERRORS IN APPT MGT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues as they relate to the 
 Scheduling package:
  
 1. When cancelling an appointment within the Appointment Management [SDAM
    APPT MGT] option, if another user cancels the same appointment an 
    undefined error occurs.
  
 2. If an appointment is cancelled using the clinic selection within the         
    Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] option, the Appointment 
    Management option, reverts to patient view instead of clinic view.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
 1)  HD0000000624666 - CAN+4^SDAMC *SDCLN
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There are 3 different scenarios to produce this issue.
  
 Scenario 1:
 If a user cancels an appointment within the Appointment Management [SDAM
 APPT MGT] option, using the patient selection, at the same time another 
 user on a separate session cancels the same appointment, the user receives
 the following error: <UNDEFINED>CAN+4^SDAMC*SDCLN.
  
 Scenario 2: 
 If a user cancels an appointment within the Appointment Management [SDAM
 APPT MGT] option, using the clinic selection, at the same time another    
 user on a separate session cancels the same appointment, the user receives
 the following error: <UNDEFINED>BLD+3^SDAM1 *SDFN.
  
 Scenario 3:
 If a user cancels an appointment within the Appointment Management [SDAM
 APPT MGT] option and inputs any characters other than (Y)ES or (N)O at the
 prompt requesting to print letters for cancelled appointments the user
 receives the following error: <UNDEFINED>LET+1^SDCNP1 *SC.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines SDAMC and SDCNP1 have been modified by calling the Electronic 
 Wait List Notification for verification of any related entries for the 
 patient.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000710820 - Scheduling application operating differently
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If an appointment is cancelled using the clinic selection within the           
 Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] menu option, the Appointment
 Management reverts to Patient View instead of Clinic View.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDAMC has been modified and will now return to Clinic View when 
 using Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] menu option, if the patient
 was updated using the clinic selection option.
