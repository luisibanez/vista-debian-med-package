 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000590082 - SUBSCRIPT>CHKENC+6^SDAM1
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to retrieve the status for an appointment, if the status 
 field in the associated OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) is null, the 
 above subscript error will occur.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SDAM1 is being modified to address the original issue being 
 fixed with patch SD*5.3*567 in a different manner that allows the original
 logic flow to remain intact without a break to call the sub-routine 
 introduced in that patch. The new logic will retrieve the check out date 
 from the Outpatient Encounter record associated with the appointment from 
 the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68), when the appointment data
 contained in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) has been deleted via menu
 option Purge Scheduling Data [SD PURGE]. This will resolve both the
 original issue and eliminate the above subscript error.
  
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 The code in routine SDAM1, that was introduced with patch SD*5.3*567, has 
 been modified and the sub-routine (API) CHKENC has been removed.
  
 That following code is being added at line STATUS+16^SDAM1:
  
 I 'Y,SDT<$$NOW^XLFDT N SDSCE S SDSCE=$P($G(^DPT(DFN,"S",SDT,0)),U,20) D
   ;pointer to OE
 .I SDSCE S $P(Y,U,3)=$P($G(^SCE(SDSCE,0)),U,7) ;check out date
