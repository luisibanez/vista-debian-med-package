Subject: PCMM Principal Mental Health Provider API's

Category:

  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch was developed in support of the Improve Veteran Mental Health 
 (IVMH) initiative.  It addresses the need of displaying a patient's 
 Mental Health Treatment Coordinator (MHTC) in the CPRS and providing a 
 means to display all MHTC's in the CPRS.  The modifications and 
 enhancements to PCMM are as follows:
  
 1.      Provide an API to display the MHTC on the CPRS patient inquiry 
         screen.
  
 2.      Provide an API to display all MHTC's in CPRS.
  
 3.      Within Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) the STANDARD 
         POSITION (403.46) file is modified to accommodate the following
         new roles. These new roles are used by Mental Health to identify
         the MHTC's and other Mental Health providers.
  
             Addiction Therapist
             Addiction Therapist (MHTC)
             Chaplain
             Chaplain (MHTC)
             Clinical Nurse Specialist (MHTC)
             Clinical Pharmacist (MHTC)

             MFT (MHTC) 
             LPC
             LPC (MHTC)
             Nurse (RN) (MHTC)

             Social Worker (MHTC)
             Voc Rehab Spec/Counselor
             Voc Rehab Spec/Counselor (MHTC)
  
 National training will be provided to Mental Health Service in the use of 
 PCMM and the set up of MHTC's within PCMM.
  
 This patch includes a new GUI executable.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR): 2008051
 ===========================================================
 Identification of Principal Mental Health Provider
 In order to improve continuity of care for veterans receiving mental 
 health treatment, the primary provider in mental health needs to be 
 easily identifiable in the patient record. Currently, this is not the 
 case, and it can create difficulties in coordination of care. On the 
 surface, it would seem that modifying PCMM to allow for designation and 
 display of primary mental health provider would be the most 
 straightforward approach, but the OMHS program office would defer to 
 other recommendations based on further analysis.
  
 There are no Remedy Tickets associated with this patch.

 The file listed above may be obtained via FTP. The preferred method
 is to FTP the file from:
  
 download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  Sites
 may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server
 as follows:
  
 CIO FIELD OFFICE   FTP ADDRESS                 DIRECTORY
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 Albany             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov    [anonymous.software]
 Hines              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov     [anonymous.software]
 Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
 PCMM.EXE will replace the existing PCMM.EXE which is
 usually found in the Program File/VISTA/PCMM directory of the client
 workstation. Workstations without an existing PCMM GUI application
 installed should first download and run SD_53_P204.EXE to install the
 previous version of PCMM. Then the PCMM.EXE should be replaced with
 the new version.
