Description:
============

 This patch includes a new gui executable.
  
 This patch enhances PCMM (Patient Care Management Module) functionality
 and provides the following enhancements and major modifications:
  
 ***********************************NOTE***********************************
 Patch SD*5.3*504  has a post-init routine that verifies the correct 
 setup of  OIF/OEF Teams and Roles within PCMM and will abort if the 
 OIF/OEF Teams and Roles are not set up correctly. If the patch does 
 abort, the PCMM Main Menu [SCMC PCMM MAIN MENU] remains OUT OF ORDER 
 and IRM should run the Pre-Init routine PRE^SD53P504. Please review
 patch SD*5.3*515 for additional information on the OIF/OEF functionality
 and correct the set up of the teams and roles. The pre-init routine can
 be run as many times as needed until all issues with the Teams and Roles
 are resolved. Once the issues are resolved, patch SD*5.3*504 loading
 process can continue.
 **************************************************************************
  
 1. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to display a 
 "Patients" tab.  The Patients tab displays a list of the patients assigned
 the current position selected, to include Patient Name, Social Security
 Number (SSN), Activation date, and total patients for the position.  The
 user can search the patients by name and print the list of patients.
  
 2. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to show 
 active/inactive team positions and display a column showing the
 Active/Inactive status.
  
 3. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to display 
 the following items in addition to the position name: Role, Staff Name,
 PCP status, Preceptor status, Position status (Active or Inactive), and
 FTEE.
  
 4. The Associated Clinics tab has been widened, so the entire name of the 
 associated clinic is displayed and not cut off.
  
 5. The Associated Clinics tab has been modified so that the clinic name 
 remains on display after saving changes.
  
 6. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to conform 
 more to standard windows interface conventions as well as look and
 feel.  This screen was modified to have a central Save/Cancel button
 that's used to save all changes, regardless of which tab the user is
 working on.  In addition several buttons have been replaced with tab
 screens to match existing tab screens.
  
 7. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to remain on 
 the current tab when saving information.  Previous versions always
 returned to the General tab after saving, causing the user to have to
 click back on the previous tab to continue entering information for that
 tab.
  
 8. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to keep the 
 selected team position highlighted as the user navigates through tabs.
  
 9. The History tab was modified to display the history of the highlighted 
 entry without having to double-click on the entry to see the details.
  
 10. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to display a 
 drop down list of team names of which the user can select from and change
 teams. This change allows the user to work on different teams without
 closing the team position setup screen.
  
 11. The software was modified to allow the user to select multiple Font 
 values for display.
  
 12. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to allow 
 sorting of positions on the team by the following columns:
     a. Role
     b. Staff Name
     c. Primary Care Provider (PCP)
     d. Preceptor
     e. Status (Active/Inactive)
     f. FTEE
    
 13. A Preceptors/Preceptees tab has been added to the Primary Care Team 
 Position Setup screen to display the Preceptor for a position, or if the 
 position is a Preceptor, it displays a list of Preceptees.
  
 14. A feature has been added to the Preceptor tab of the Primary Care 
 Team Position Setup screen that allows a user to reassign Preceptees to 
 another Preceptor so that a particular Preceptor may be deactivated.
  
 15. The Primary Care Team Position Setup screen was modified to allow a 
 Preceptor position to be changed to a non-preceptor position, as long as
 the preceptor does not have preceptees assigned to him/her and no patients
 are assigned to that position.
  
 16. The patient Team - Position Assignments screen was modified to prompt
 for a reason for un-assignment when un-assigning patients:
 (Note: automatic reasons are set by the system during automatic 
 discharges and are not selectable by the user):
      a. Deceased (automatic)
      b. Patient Relocated
      c. Requested by Patient
      d. No Longer Needed
      e. Automatic Inactivation (automatic)
      f. PCP change
  
 17. The software was modified so that it does not prompt "Do you want to
 enroll in a clinic?" throughout the software.
  
 18. The Select Patient - Team Assignment screen was modified to allow the 
 tagging (checkbox) that establishes Exception flags when a patient has
 multiple PCPs, in which the user will follow the Business Rules for
 allowing multiple PCPs when manually checking the box.
  
 19. The patient Team - Position Assignments screen was modified to allow 
 a patient to be assigned to more than one panel on the same day as long 
 as the patient has been unassigned from all other primary care provider
 (PCP) panels on the same day.
  
 20. The roll-n-scroll "Report of Patient Automated Inactivation From PC 
 Panels" has been enhanced.  This report will display patients that have 
 been auto-inactivated.  The report may be sorted by Date, Institution, 
 Patient, Provider, Reason, Team or Team Position. Report columns will 
 include Patient Name, SSN, Primary Care Team, Provider Team Position, 
 Preceptor Team Position, Date Patient Unassigned, Reason Patient 
 Unassigned. The report may be printed to a standard Windows printer.
  
 21. The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 'SCMC PCMM CHECK FTEE' has been edited
 to ensure the FTEE value passed in is a numeric format between .01 and 1,
 maximum of two decimal digits. If the passed FTEE value does not match
 this pattern, the RPC will return the value '99.1' to the PCMM GUI.
  
 22. The issue with OIF/OEF (TRANSITION ASSISTANCE and CASE MANAGEMENT of
 OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM and OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM) entry in the TEAM
 PURPOSE file(#403.47), which is a pointer field TEAM PURPOSE(#.03) in the
 TEAM file (#404.51). The purpose of OIF/OEF destination in the Team
 Purpose file (#403.47) is to specify for OIF AND OEF transition 
 assistance. There should be only one OIF/OEF destination per site. This
 patch will screen the PCMM GUI application, not allowing more than one
 OIF/OEF team.  An option is included with this patch to display all Teams
 using the OIF/OEF destination in the TEAM file (#404.51). The option SCMC
 PCMM TEAM PURPOSE LIST is a stand alone print option that displays all
 TEAMS that have OIF OEF entered as a TEAM PURPOSE. The list can be used
 for future reference when setting up or troubleshooting OIF/OEF issues.
 The information in PCMM related to the OIF/ OEF Team shall be transmitted
 to Austin in the same manner as Primary Care Team information is
 transmitted. This information will be monitored and tracked by the VSSC.
  
 23.  A screen has been added to allow users to only select OIF OEF roles 
 for positions assigned to the OIF OEF team.
  
 24.  Rejected entries in the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG associated with 
 past incorrect role assignments to OIF OEF positions are processed and 
 the corrected data are re-transmitted to the Austin Information and 
 Technology Center (AITC).  A summary email message is sent to the PCMM HL7
 MESSAGES mail group.
  
 25.  Staff assigned to a position must be inactivated before the position 
 can be inactivated.
  
 26.  Status reason is automatically selected when adding staff or 
 preceptor.
  
 27.  Position history record is automatically deleted if user selects 
 Cancel in the position activation date window when creating a new 
 position.
  
 28.  Users can no longer add a new position to an inactive team.
  
 29.  Users can no longer modify a role with assigned staff if the person 
 class of the assigned staff conflicts with new role.  Users also cannot
 change a primary care role to a non primary care role if 'provides primary
 care' setting is selected.
  
 30.  The last assignment date on the Staff tab can be deleted using a
 right mouse click.
  
 31.  It is no longer possible to assign a NP or PA as a preceptor for a 
 resident or intern.
  
 32.  The Pre-Init routine sets the 'ENABLE AUTOLINK FUNCTIONALITY(#803)' 
 field in the SCHEDULING PARAMETER(#404.91) file to 'NO' if the field is 
 set to 'YES'. This action will gray out the AUTOLINK FUNCTIONALITY tag in 
 the PCMM GUI, which isn't operational at this time.

 Overview of Remedy Ticket 178054:
 ---------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 PCMM GUI users are not being prompted to enroll patient in clinic as 
 described in the user manual.
  
 Resolution:
 The functionality to enroll a  patient in a clinic has been removed and 
 references in the user manual have been updated.
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket 63384:
 --------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 The Patient Lookup process does not highlight patient's name in the   
 top part of the box after entering a patient's name in the search box.
  
 Resolution:
 By default, the first entry on the list is highlighted.  Pressing the 
 return key selects the highlighted entry.
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket 63451:
 -------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 Duplicate of 63384 and user found tab design on Team Position Setup 
 window to be inefficient.
  
  
 Resolution:       
 Duplicate of 63384 and the Team Position Setup window has undergone 
 significant improvement.
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket 64392:
 --------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 When entering Primary Care FTEE data for a team, if the "Close" button
 is clicked instead of the "Save" button, the window closes without
 prompting to save data.
  
  
 Resolution:
 If FTEE data values changes a confirmation dialog is invoked to determine 
 if changes should be saved in the event the user attempts to close the 
 windows without saving changes.
  
 Overview of Remedy Tickets 311256,311946,315284,316803,319620,320190
 328289,338871,342467,342471,342475,342479,342608,351948,360200,445191
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 Problem:
 ADT A08 HL7 messages segments are sent to the AITC with missing PID and
 EVN segments. The AITC cannot process these messages and returns an
 application reject to the site with error codes 001M, 104M and 113M. This
 type of application reject occurs if a patient is assigned/unassigned to a
 position on the OIF OEF team that does not have an OIF OEF role.
  
 Even if the site corrects the configuration error, the site cannot use the
 PCMM Transmission Error Processing option to process error rejects and
 retransmit the data to the AITC.
  
 Resolution:
 This patch adds a GUI screen to prevent users from selecting incorrect
 roles for OIF OEF positions.
  
 The patch also adds a pre-install check for OIF OEF configuration
 errors. If any errors are detected the patch installation will abort.
 Please refer to the patch description to address OIF/OEF functionality 
 and the correct set up of the teams and roles within PCMM.
  
 Any past rejected entries in the PCMM HL7 TRANSMISSION LOG associated with
 this type of error are processed during the post install.  The correct
 data are re-sent to the AITC during the normal PCMM transmission.

 ***********************************NOTE***********************************
 There is one known anomaly with the installation of this  patch. This 
 anomaly only occurs if you are running PCMM on a 64 Bit server. If the  
 site is using a 64 bit server, PCMM labels will not be displayed on the
 tabs in the GUI.  If this  occurs IRM should install PCMM on a 32 bit
 server, or if using a thin client  it should be pointed to a 32 bit 
 server.   
 **************************************************************************

     Salt Lake City     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov       [anonymous.software]
  
     PCMM.EXE will replace the existing PCMM.EXE which is
     usually found in the Program File/VISTA/PCMM directory of the client
     workstation. Workstations without an existing PCMM GUI application
     installed should first download and run SD_53_P204.EXE to install the
     previous version of PCMM. Then the PCMM.EXE should be replaced with
     the new version.
  
     The updated PCMM User Manual can be found at the following location:
