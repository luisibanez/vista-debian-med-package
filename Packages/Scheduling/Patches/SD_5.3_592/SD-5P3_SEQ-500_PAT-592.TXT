Subject: FIX APPT CANCELLATION TIME AND WARNING MESSAGE FOR APPT CANCEL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two Scheduling issues:
  
 1. When an appointment is cancelled, the software rounds and files the   
    cancellation date/time rather than filing the precise time.
  
 2. When a user attempts to cancel a checked out appointment, a warning
    message is displayed with the incorrect appointment number.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) INC000000599584 - Appointment Cancellation Time Not Precise
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When an appointment is cancelled the software rounds and files the
    date/time rather than filing the precise time.  Depending which applies,
    cancellation date/time and no-show date/time are both stored in             
    NO-SHOW/CANCEL DATE/TIME field (#15) of the APPOINTMENT sub-file (#2.98)    
    of the PATIENT file (#2).  No-show date/times are not rounded off and the
    precise time is filed.  Cancellation date/times should be filed in the      
    same manner, with no rounding of the time.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDCNP0 will be modified to remove the logic that is rounding
    the time before filing a cancellation date/time, so that it files the
    precise time, the same as with no-show date/times.
  
 2) INC000000713571 - Display issue with Appointment Cancellation
  
    Problem:
    --------
    If a user goes into option APPOINTMENT MANAGEMENT [SDAM APPT MGT],
    either by clinic or by patient, and they attempt to cancel an 
    appointment while another user on another session has checked out
    that same appointment, a warning message is displayed. This message 
    will be partially incorrect if the selected appointment was not the 
    first appointment in the appointment list.  The first line of the 
    warning message will echo back and display the correctly selected 
    appointment from the list. However, the second line of the message 
    will always read:
    ">>> Appointment #1 has a check out date and cannot be cancelled."
  
    Although the statement is correct, it indicates the wrong appointment
    number from the appointment list (unless the first appointment in the
    list was the one selected).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDAMC will be modified to setup the proper appointment list
    selection variable therefore what is displayed is the correct information to
    the user.
