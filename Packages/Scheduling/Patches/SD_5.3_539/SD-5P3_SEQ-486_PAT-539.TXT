 (EWL), Patient Appointment Information Transmission (PAIT) and the 
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) as reported in the following Remedy

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
  
 1)  HD0000000306890 - Patient inactivation
  
 Problem:
 ======= 
 The PCMM NIGHTLY TASK [SCMC PCMM NIGHTLY TASK] option that reports on 
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) inactivation messages references 
 VHA Directive 2003-063 which was rescinded by VHA Directive 2006-059.
   
 Solution:
 ========
 Modification has been made to eliminate a reference to the rescinded
 VHA DIRECTIVE 2003-063.
  
  
 Description of the following messages has been modified:
  
 Patients Scheduled for Inactivation from PC Panel
 Patients With Extended PCMM Inactivation Dates
 Patients Automated Inactivations from PC Panels
  
 **Due to this change the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) User Manual
 Will be updated on pages 8-10.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000242378 - Wait List enter/edit problem
  
 Problem:
 =======
 One part of the SD Wait List Cleanup [SD WAIT LIST CLEANUP] report is titled
 the Wait List Key Field 'NULL'  which was created when the EWL package
 erroneously allowed for creation of EWL entries with missing but required
 fields. The entries have been closed but are still listed as awaiting
 correction. Report may also show some old EWL entries that do not have
 the required CURRENT STATUS field (#23). Both of these show as incomplete on
 the report but as Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT]
 option recognizes only open EWL entries, these can't be changed and should
 not be listed on the report.
    
 Solution:
 ======== 
 The SD Wait List Cleanup [SD WAIT LIST CLEANUP] report was modified as follows:
  
 When evaluating EWL entries for the Wait List Key Field 'NULL' listing do 
 not evaluate incomplete entries not having the CURRENT STATUS field (# 
 23) of the SD WAIT LIST file (# 409.3) populated.  
  
 Entries with 'NULL' in the CURRENT STATUS field will be closed by this 
 report using code ER:ENTERED IN ERROR filed in the DISPOSITION field
 (#21) if their ORIGINATING DATE field (#1) is before the current
 computer date.( This will assure that this will not interfere with any
 process of partial EWL entry on the same date the report is generated as
 valid incomplete entries might have been created due to a physical
 disconnection of the user's workstation during the EWL entry process 
 which need to be reported on).
  
 Eliminate any closed EWL entries from evaluation of  'NULL' values in 
 their required fields.
  
 Closed entries will not be listed on the report.
  
 The Open Closed EWL Entry [SD WAIT LIST OPEN CLOSED ENTRY] option was modified
 to not allow opening of closed EWL entries with code ER:ENTERED IN ERROR.
  
    
 3)  HD0000000323988 - SD WAIT LIST CLEAN UP
  
 Problem:
 =======
 The existing software of the SD Wait List Cleanup [SD WAIT LIST CLEANUP] option
 does not handle all circumstances correctly. The cleanup option should address
 only open wait list entries because the closed entries can't be corrected.
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Only open EWL entries will be evaluated by the SD Wait List Cleanup [SD WAIT
 LIST CLEANUP] option and the user is prompted there for correction if
 applicable.
  
 **Due to this change the Electronic Wait List (EWL) for Scheduling and 
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) User Manual will be updated on 
 pages 50 & 70.
   
  
 4)  HD0000000306704 - ERROR 850 for PAIT
  
 Problem:
 =======
 It has been determined that PV1 segment should contain the 'empty' value 
 Instead of '0000' in sequence P1.4 if both the Appointment Type field 
 (#9.5) and the Purpose of Visit field (#9) in the Appointment multiple
 (#1900) of the Patient file (#2) are NULL. It happens very seldom,
 primarily with canceled appointments.
  
 Solution:
 =========
 Routine SDRPA20 was modified to generate the PV1 segment with the 
 Admission Type sequence as NULL if both the Appointment Type field
 (#9.5) and the Purpose of the Visit field (#9) field in the Appointment
 multiple (#1900) of the Patient file are NULL as well.
 All previously rejected appointments as described above, will be accepted 
 because newly generated appointment entries will have NULL instead of 
 '0000' if applicable.
  
  
 5)  HD0000000335268 - No integration agreement for $$EOP^ESPUTIL in  SDWLCU6
  
 Problem:
 =======
 There was no integration agreement for a call to $$EOP^ESPUTIL() in 
 routine SDWLCU6. Additionally, the called function has not been published.
  
  
 Solution:
 ========
 Code was added to the routine for the function so the call is not needed.
