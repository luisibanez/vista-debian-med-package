 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000391866 - Problem with Print Letters for Nonresponsive Patients
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that nonresponsive patients keep receiving a "second"
    recall letter, even though they have already received multiple second
    letters. Often, patients are receiving another letter before they have
    time to respond to a letter just received.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRRECL and SDRRRECP to print only one "second" 
    letter or card to the nonresponsive patients.
  
 2. HD0000000418683 - Letter printing Lab test(s) line is not printing 
                      correctly
    Duplicate:
    HD0000000457175 - Recall reminder letter formatting
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported the text line starting with the words "Lab test(s)" do 
    not wrap properly. The lines break at a fixed number of characters
    splitting words into fragments.
  
    The problem only occurs with the manual print; the tasked print works 
    fine. Only recall letters are affected.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRRECL to change the tab setting from column 25 to 
    2 and add three more lines before printing the "Lab test(s)" line. 
    This also allows non-address information to be out of view from the
    window of the envelope in which the recall reminders are sent.
  
    This change will make the tab setting consistent with auto print.
  
 3. HD0000000428646 - can manually print a letter even if pt does not have 
                      a recall listed
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that they can manually print a letter for a particular 
    clinic even if patient does not have a recall listed for that clinic.
    Also, patients with the same first letter of their last name and same
    last 4 digits of SSN can print a reminder letter for the wrong patient
    even though the hospital location does not match the one selected for
    the letter.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine SDRRRECL to prevent recall letters to be printed if 
    patient's clinic does not match the selected hospital location. Also, 
    when patients have the same first letter of their last
    name and same last 4 digits of SSN, check if the clinic of the selected
    patient matches the selected hospital location.
