Subject: FIXES DATE W/O YEAR, DISPLAYS EWL MESSAGE, DOESNT FILL INACTIVATED BY FIELD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses several Electronic Wait List (EWL) related issues:
  
 1. When a user attempts to place a patient on the wait list for a future 
    appointment, the date defaults to the past date unless a year has been
    entered.
  
 2. A cancelled appointment is not displaying a warning message if there 
    are wait list entries for a specific patient or clinic.
  
 3. When a user views a clinic, the user's name is automatically populated
    in the INACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field.
  
 4. When a user views a clinic, the user's name is automatically populated 
    in the ACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1)  HD0000000368638 - Date w/o year bring up past date
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Enter/Edit Wait List (Sch/PCMM) [SD WAIT LIST ENTER/EDIT] 
 option, if a user attempts to place a patient on the wait list for a 
 future appointment, the date of the appointment defaults to the past date
 unless a year has been entered.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine SDWLE110 has been modified to interpret the desired date, entered
 in an incomplete format (Month/Day), to always be set as a future date 
 as expected by the user.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000400404 - Cancelled appointment not prompting for EWL
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When an appointment is cancelled using the Cancel Appointment [SD CANCEL 
 APPOINTMENT] option, the message warning: "There are Wait List entries 
 waiting for an Appointment for this patient in **name of clinic**." does 
 not appear even if there are entries in the wait list.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routines SDAMC and SDCNP1 were modified to display a message that
 there are wait list entries waiting for an appointment for a
 patient.
  
  
 3)  HD0000000415225 - SD WL CLINIC LOCATION (409.32)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user views a clinic using the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Parameter 
 Enter/Edit [SD WAIT LIST PAR ENTER/EDIT] option, the user's name is 
 automatically populated in the INACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field (#4) of 
 the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION file (#409.32) even if the clinic has not been
 inactivated.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine SDWLPE was modified to put the user's name in the
 INACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field (#4) of the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION
 file (#409.32) only if the user first sets an inactivation date in the
 DATE INACTIVATED field (#3).
  
  
 4) HD0000000498359 - ACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field (#2) being
                      improperly filled.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user views a clinic using the Wait List (Sch/PCMM) Parameter 
 Enter/Edit [SD WAIT LIST PAR ENTER/EDIT] option, the user's name is 
 automatically populated in the ACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field (#2) of 
 the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION file (#409.32) even if the clinic has 
 already been activated.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine SDWLPE was modified to put the user's name in the
 ACTIVATION DATE ENTERED BY field (#2) of the SD WL CLINIC LOCATION
 file (#409.32) only if the clinic was activated by the user.
