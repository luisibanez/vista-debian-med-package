Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2014 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) 
 file as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
  
                         ***IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on September 30, 2013 **
 ** as possible, but not after the start of business on October 1, 2013. **
 ** Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of     **
 ** incorrect stop codes that will result in errors from Austin.         **
 ** Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS       **
 ** (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch   **
 ** will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be  **
 ** done in a site's mirror account before installation in production to **
 ** verify changes.                                                      **
 **                                                                      **
 ** This patch inactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop    **
 ** codes effective October 1, 2013, therefore, installing early may     **
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site. **
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will        **
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as   **
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop      **
 ** code corrections cannot be assigned until October 1, 2013.           **
 ** All other stop code corrections should be made as early as possible  **
 ** on October 1, 2013.  Sites need to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND  **
 ** STOP CODES file (#728.44) worksheet maintenance to save the latest   **
 ** FY2013 values (as of Sep 30, 2013), and then not change the work-    **
 ** sheet to have FY2014 values until after the DSS Clinic (CLI)         **
 ** extract for September data has run successfully.                     **
