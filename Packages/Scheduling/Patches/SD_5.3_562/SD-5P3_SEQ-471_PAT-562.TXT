 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000349659 - CUSS Report Problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a day for a clinic is partially cancelled, the calculations
    for the Clinic Utilization Statistical Summary [SCRPW CLINICUTILIZATION
    SUMM] (CUSS report) incorrectly reflects the normal clinic capacity for
    that day (based on the Master Pattern set up for that day of the week)
    and is not adjusting for the availability slots that have been
    cancelled by the clinic.  This also applies to the adjusted 
    availability.  The value for adjusted availability should initially be
    the same as that of capacity and will be further adjusted as scheduled
    and unscheduled appointments are calculated.  For example, if the
    normal capacity for Mondays is 16 available slots and one Monday was
    partially cancelled, cancelling 6 of those slots, the capacity for that
    one Monday should be calculated as 10 (i.e., normal capacity of 16
    minus 6 cancelled slots) and the adjusted availability for that day
    should initially be 10.  Instead, the report is calculating the 
    normal capacity and adjusted availability as 16 for that Monday that
    was partially cancelled.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW3 will be modified so that when a day is partially
    cancelled, the CUSS report will correctly calculate the clinic
    capacity and adjusted availability for that day by subtracting the
    number of cancelled slots from the normal capacity and adjusted
    availability amounts.
  
 2) HD0000000359314 - ACRP column heading error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] in a
    delimited format for export to a spreadsheet, the report shows column
    headings of % CHANGE UNIQUES, % CHANGE VISITS and % CHANGE UNIQUES.  
    The data for the report is correct; however, that first column heading
    of % CHANGE UNIQUES is incorrect and should show as % CHANGE
    ENCOUNTERS.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW28 will be modified to insure the correct column heading
    shows for % CHANGE ENCOUNTERS when running the report in a delimited
    format for export to a spreadsheet.  The correct column headings will
    now show as % CHANGE ENCOUNTERS, % CHANGE VISITS and % CHANGE UNIQUES.
  
 3) HD0000000374955 - <SUBSCRIPT>MTI+16^SCDXUTL0
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Occasionally, this error will occur when the Ambulatory Care Nightly
    Transmission to NPCDB [SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT] comes across an
    outpatient encounter that contains an invalid eligibility code of -1 or
    a date.  When this happens it causes the Ambcare transmission to abort.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCDXUTL0 will be modified to make additional checks of the
    validity of the eligibility code that is pulled from an outpatient
    encounter record in the OUTPATIENT ENCOUNTER file (#409.68) and passed
    into this routine.  When one of these additional invalid values is
    found, the outpatient encounter will be rejected and will then appear
    on the Incomplete Encounter Error Report [SCENI IEMM ERROR REPORT]
    for error code 7000, Encounter Eligibility code missing or invalid.  
    It may also appear on the report for error code 7030, Eligibility Code
    Inactive.  
  
 4) HD0000000385528 - $ZE= <UNDEFINED>ENROL+5^SCRPW24
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD HOC REPORT] is run with a report
    limitation of enrollment and a sub-limitation of enrollment status,
    this error will occasionally occur when the Date/Time Entered field 
    (#75.01) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) is undefined.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW24 will be modified to check if the Date/Time Entered
    field (#75.01) in the PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11) is defined for
    the patient.  When it is not defined, the routine will then get the
    patient enrollment record that is most recent to the encounter
    date using the .01 field (Enrollment Application Date) of the
    PATIENT ENROLLMENT file (#27.11).
  
 5) HD0000000355942 - SCRPW PTACTBYAPPTFREQ option getting <UNDEF>
                      EVAL+1^SCRPW11 errors
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The above undefined variable error occasionally occurs when running
    the option Patient Activity by Appointment Frequency [SCRPW
    PTACTBYAPPTFREQ] when it comes across an appointment contained in the
    Appointment sub-file (#44.001) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44)
    where the patient DFN (Data File Number), pointer to the PATIENT file
    (#2) is missing. This is a rare anomaly which sporadically occurs when
    an appointment is cancelled.  When an appointment is cancelled, the
    appointment sub-file record in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) is
    supposed to be entirely deleted; however, occasionally (although  
    rarely), the record is only partially deleted.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW11 will be modified so that when running the option
    Patient Activity by Appointment Frequency [SCRPW PTACTBYAPPTFREQ],
    if it comes across one of these partially deleted appointment sub-file
    records in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), the remainder of that
    record will be appropriately deleted via FileMan API (Application 
    Program Interface) DIK (delete entry).  This will prevent the
    <UNDEFINED> error from occurring, while properly cleaning up the file.
