Subject: MID-FY2012 TABLE MAINTENANCE FOR CLINIC STOP FILE (#40.7)

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides mid-Fiscal Year 2012 updates to the CLINIC STOP
 file (#40.7) as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
                         ***IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with a compliance date of March 31, 2012.*
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on March 30, 2012      *
 ** as possible, but not after March 31, 2012.  Early installation of     *
 ** this patch could result in transmission of incorrect stop codes       *
 ** that will result in errors from Austin.  Coordination with the        *
 ** MAS PAS/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch will cause changes to the   *
 ** CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be done in a site's mirror     *
 ** account before installation in production to verify changes.          *
 ** This patch inactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop     *
 ** codes effective March 31, 2012, therefore, installing early may       *
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site.  *
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will         *
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as    *
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop       *
 ** code corrections should not be assigned until March 31, 2012 as they  *
 ** will not be accepted in Austin until that date.  All other stop code  *
 ** corrections should be made as early as possible on March 31, 2012.    *
 **                                                                       *

 DSS Addendum:
 =============
 This patch adds changes to the CLINIC STOP (Stop Code) file (#40.7) as of 
 March 31, 2012.
  
 1)  No clinic can be created using any of the new Stop Codes contained in
     the patch until after this patch is implemented.
 2)  Any clinics using a Stop Code inactivated by the patch should have
     an active Stop Code assigned.  (This can be done prior to patch
     implementation, if desired).
  
 DSS Site Teams and MAS should coordinate to perform the following 
 sequence:
 =================================================================
  
 1)  Run the DSS CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP FILE and determine all values for
     March clinics before the patch is installed.
 2)  IRM installs the patch (SD*5.3*587) in VistA as late as possible on
     March 30, or by late March 31, 2012.
 3)  Make corrections to clinics but NOT to DSS Clinics and Stop Code
     Worksheet.
 4)  Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for March, 2012.
 5)  Make changes to the Clinics and Stop Code Worksheet, incorporating the
     stop code changes prior to extracting April workload.

 TECHNICAL SUMMARY:
 ==================
 The following Fileman template may help the MAS/ADPAC to identify any 
 clinics that contain stop code 715 as the Credit Stop Code.  The ADPAC 
 will have to take necessary action to either remove or replace this 
 Credit Stop Code in each of the applicable clinics.  Please note that the 
 IF statement in the Fileman Inquiry echoes back the Internal Entry Number 
 for the Clinic Stop file (#40.7) for the selected stop code.
