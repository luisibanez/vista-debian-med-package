Subject: SCHEDULING ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the following issues related to the Scheduling
 software:
  
     - When exiting the Expand Entry Protocol in Appointment Management
       [SDAM APPT MGT], not all variables are being properly killed.  
     - After the Purge Scheduling Data [SD PURGE] option is ran,
       Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] and Patient Care Encounter
       display the status for the appointments affected by the purge, as
       'No Action Taken', instead of 'Checked Out'.
     - There is a Data Dictionary discrepancy which exists with the
       SPECIAL AVAILABILITY FLAG field (#3) of the PATTERN sub-file
       (#44.005) in the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44), which is storing the
       record Internal Entry Number instead of the applicable date.
     - An undefined error occasionally occurs when Scheduling clerks are
       making appointments.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000339261 - Expand Entry in SDAM doesn't kill variables
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user goes into Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] and 
    selects Action Protocol Expand Entry to view patient information for an
    appointment, upon exiting Appointment Management, if a user enters 
    another menu option, such as Recall Reminder Main Menu [SDRR RECALL 
    MAIN MENU] then selects the Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient [SDRR CARD 
    ADD] option; instead of the Patient Name prompt displaying, the system
    immediately returns the user to the menu. This issue occurs due to a 
    variable not being properly deleted.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDAMEP will be modified to explicitly kill variable DIC
    upon exiting the Expand Entry Action Protocol in Appointment
    Management [SDAM APPT MGT].
  
  
 2) HD0000000371339 - Side effects of Purge option
  
    Problem:
    --------
    After running the Purge Scheduling Data [SD PURGE] option, appointments
    for the date range of the purge, will now display a status of 'No
    Action Taken', instead of 'Checked Out', when viewed in Appointment
    Management [SDAM APPT MGT] or PCE Encounter Data Entry [PXCE ENCOUNTER 
    DATA ENTRY].
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDAM1 will be modified so that appointments affected by the
    purge will now show the correct status when viewed in Appointment
    Management [SDAM APPT MGT] or PCE Encounter Data Entry [PXCE ENCOUNTER
    DATA ENTRY].
  
  
 3) HD0000000415636 - Data Dictionary Discrepancy
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The data dictionary for the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44) indicates the
    SPECIAL AVAILABILITY FLAG field (#3) of the PATTERN sub-file (#44.005)
    is supposed to be a date field, but instead it is storing the Internal
    Entry Number (IEN) for the record.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDB1 will be modified so that the appropriate date is now
    stored in the SPECIAL AVAILABILITY FLAG field (#3) of the PATTERN 
    sub-file (#44.005) of the HOSPITAL LOCATION file (#44). Additionally,
    post-init routine SD53P567 was created to read through the HOSPITAL
    LOCATION file (#44) and where applicable, change the SPECIAL 
    AVAILABILITY FLAG field (#3) of the PATTERN sub-file (#44.005) to the
    appropriate date. Since this does not have any effect on other
    applications, the post-init routine will search the HOSPITAL LOCATION
    file (#44) starting from the beginning of Fiscal Year 2009 (October 1,
    2009).
  
  
 4) HD0000000321086 - <UNDEFINED>WLCL120+4^SDM2A
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Occasionally an undefined error occurs when a Scheduling clerk attempts
    to make an appointment, using either Appointment Management [SDAM APPT
    MGT] or Make Appointment [SDM] menu options. The error occurs because
    no check is being made for the existence of an availability pattern for
    a selected date prior to trying to use that date to calculate for the
    120 day rule.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDM2A will be modified to check for the existence of an
    availability pattern for a selected date before trying to use that
    date to calculate for the 120 day rule. This will prevent future
    occurrences of this error. A new Remedy ticket has been logged which
    will remain open so research will continue in an attempt to determine
    what is causing the file corruption that causes this sporadic error.
