 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000314908 - How to change stop code entry
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a clinic was set up with the incorrect primary stop code, the primary 
 stop code for an encounter may need to be updated.
 The stop code can be edited using the Incomplete Encounter Management 
 Module (IEMM) menu option Edit Outpatient Encounter [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER
 EDIT].  When this option is used to edit the primary stop code, it will
 update the Outpatient Encounter file (#409.68) with the new primary stop
 code and the Visit file (#9000010) for the record that is linked to the
 Encounter.  It will also mark the Encounter in the Transmitted Outpatient
 Encounter file (#409.73) for transmission required.
 However, if the Encounter being edited is not associated with a 
 scheduled appointment, this option will only update the Outpatient
 Encounter file (#409.68).  The Transmitted Outpatient Encounter file 
 (#409.73) will not be updated or flagged for transmission.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCENIA2 will be modified so that when the primary stop code is 
 updated for an encounter via the Edit Outpatient Encounter
 [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER EDIT] option, the following files will be updated:
 - The Outpatient Encounter file (#409.68);
 - The Visit file (#9000010), for the record that is linked to the 
 encounter;
 - The Transmitted Outpatient Encounter file (#409.73), whether 
 or not the encounter is associated with a scheduled appointment.
  
  
 2. HD0000000345881 - Issues with Edit Outpatient Encounter option
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If the Medical Center Division for an encounter is edited via the option 
 Edit Outpatient Encounter [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER EDIT], the Visit file 
 and the credit Visit file (if applicable) are not updated regardless
 whether or not an appointment is associated with the encounter and the
 encounter is not flagged for transmission required.
  
 Secondly, when the encounter is associated with an appointment and the
 patient Eligibility on an encounter is edited via option Edit Outpatient
 Encounter [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER EDIT], the appropriate files are updated:
 - The Outpatient Encounter file (#409.68);
 - The Credit or "Child" Encounter record, if applicable, (#409.68);
 - The Visit file (#9000010);
 - The credit or "child" Visit record, if applicable, (#9000010).
 - The encounter is appropriately flagged for transmission required in the
   Transmitted Outpatient Encounter file (#409.73),
 However, if the encounter is not associated with an appointment, the 
 Visit file and the Credit file, if applicable, are not updated.  Also, the
 encounter is not flagged for transmission required. 
  
 Thirdly, if the Appointment Type for an encounter is edited via this
 option, the encounter is not flagged for transmission required in
 the Transmitted Outpatient Encounter file (#409.73), if the 
 encounter is not associated with an appointment.  This edit does
 not apply to the Visit record(s).
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCENIA2 will be modified so that when any of the above
 edits are made via option Edit Outpatient Encounter [SCENI OP
 ENCOUNTER EDIT], the appropriate Visit records will be updated
 regardless whether or not the encounter is associated with an
 appointment and the encounter will be flagged for transmission
 required.
  
  
 3. HD0000000356560 - Appointment Type edits with Edit Outpatient
                      Encounter option
  
 Problem:
 --------
 As part of the Clinical Indicator Data Capture (CIDC) project,
 Patient Care Encounter (PCE) patch PX*1.0*124, introduced new
 functionality that now auto-populates the Encounter level
 Service Connection Indicator.  The Scheduling Appointment Type
 logic uses the Service Connection Indicator to determine if the
 Appointment Type in the Outpatient Encounter file should be Service
 Connected or not.  To insure compliance with this functionality, the Edit
 Outpatient Encounter option [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER EDIT], should be
 modified so that an Appointment Type of Service Connected cannot be edited
 and any other Appointment Type cannot be changed to Service
 Connected.  Editing the Eligibility also needs to be prohibited
 when the encounter is Service Connected.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCENIA2 will be modified to prohibit editing the
 Appointment Type field or the Eligibility for a selected encounter if
 it is currently set to Service Connected.  If an attempt is made to
 edit the Appointment Type for a selected encounter from any Appointment
 Type value to Service Connected the validation logic will not allow it.
  
 If an attempt is made to edit an encounter where the Service Connection
 Indicator in the associated Visit record equals 1 (Yes - Service
 Connected), the following message will now be displayed:
  
 The Visit associated with the selected encounter is SERVICE CONNECTED.
 You cannot edit the Appointment Type or Eligibility for this encounter.
  
 If an attempt is made to edit the Appointment Type to Service Connected,
 the following message will now be displayed:
  
 The Visit entry associated with the selected encounter is NOT SERVICE
 CONNECTED.  You cannot change the Appointment Type to SERVICE 
 CONNECTED.
  
 The second message shown above is being added because currently all
 the option echoes back to the user is "Updating Completed.", giving
 the user the false impression that the change was made, when it was
 not.  The message will only display when applicable.
  
  
 4. HD0000000360131 - Editing Stop Codes allows selection of Inactive Stop
                      Codes
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 Currently, when option Edit Outpatient Encounter [SCENI OP ENCOUNTER
 EDIT] is used to edit a Stop Code, the option allows the user to
 select Inactive Stop Codes and proceeds to update the Outpatient
 Encounter file (#409.68) record with the Inactive stop code selected.
 Additionally, the option will also allow the user to select Stop Codes
 that have a Restriction Type of "S" (secondary only).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCENIA2 will be modified to check if a selected Stop Code is
 Inactive or if the Restriction Type equals "S".  If the selected Stop
 Code is Inactive, the software will also check to see if the Inactive
 date is before or after the date of the selected encounter that is
 being edited.  If it is prior to the encounter date, the following
 message will be displayed to the user and they will not be allowed to
 select the Stop Code:
  
 Sorry, that Stop Code was INACTIVE at the time of the selected 
 encounter.
  
 After the above message is displayed, the user will be returned to the
 Clinic Stop Code prompt.
    
 An additional check will also be made for the Stop Code Restriction
 Type.  If it equals "S" (secondary only), the Restriction Date will
 then be checked.  If this date is prior to the encounter date, the
 following message will be displayed to the user and they will not be
 allowed to select the Stop Code.  Following the message display, the
 user will be returned to the Clinic Stop Code prompt:
  
 Sorry, the Restriction Type for that Stop Code is 'S' (secondary only).
 You cannot select this stop code.
