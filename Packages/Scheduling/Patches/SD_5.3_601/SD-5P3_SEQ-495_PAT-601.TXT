Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2013 Mid Year updates to the CLINIC STOP
 (#40.7) file as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
                         ***IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on March 31, 2013     **
 ** as possible but not after the start of business on April 1, 2013.    **
 **                                                                      **
 ** Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of     **
 ** incorrect stop codes that will result in errors from Austin.         **
 ** Coordination with the MAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS       **
 ** (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch   **
 ** will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be  **
 ** done in a site's mirror account before installation in production to **
 ** verify changes.                                                      **
 **                                                                      **
 ** This patch reactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop    **
 ** codes effective April 1, 2013, therefore, installing early may       **
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site. **
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will        **
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as   **
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop      **
 ** code corrections cannot be assigned until April 1, 2013.             **
 ** All other stop code corrections should be made as early as possible  **
 ** on April 1, 2013.  Sites need to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND    **
 ** STOP CODES file (#728.44) worksheet maintenance to save the latest   **
 ** FY2013 Mid Year values (as of March 31, 2013) and then not change    **
 ** the worksheet to have FY2013 Mid Year values until after the DSS     **
 ** Clinic (CLI) extract for March data has run successfully.            **

 DSS Instructions for FY13 Mid Year Stop Code Patch (SD*5.3*601):
 =========================================================================
 This patch makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) as 
 of April 1, 2013.
  
    - No clinic can be created using any of the new or reactivated Stop 
      Codes contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
  
 DSS Site Teams and Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the
 following sequence:
  
 1)  Before IRM installs patch SD*5.3*601, toward the end of March,
     DSS should run the DSS worksheet option CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP FILE 
     [ECXSCLOAD]. Then right at the end of March, but before the patch
     is installed, make any necessary adjustments before approval so all
     clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
     March 2013.
  
 2)  IRM installs the patch late on March 31 or very early on 
     April 1, 2013.
  
 3)  Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
     option to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL
     LOCATION file (#44) for FY13 Mid Year.  Work with Scheduling staff to make
     changes in HOSPICTAL LOCATION file (#44) so that the clinics
     will have the correct stop codes in place for FY13 Mid Year clinic 
     appointments.  Do not make changes using Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for
     CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) at this time.
  
 4)  Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for March 
     2013.  Updates should not be made for April stop code changes with
     the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option prior to
     running the March CLI Extract.  Perform normal Audits for the CLI
     Extract.
  
 5)  After auditing the March CLI Extract and after making any 
     necessary changes and transmitting the CLI Extract, proceed with FY13
     Mid Year Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet
     clinics:
  
     a) Use the Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option to run
        the Print "Unreviewed Clinics".
     b) Update for FY13 Mid Year as needed using the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes
        for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option. 
     c) Approve changes using the Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic Worksheet 
        [ECXSCAPPROV] option. Finalize all Stop Code changes on the
        worksheet to be ready to run the monthly FY13 DSS CLI Extracts.
