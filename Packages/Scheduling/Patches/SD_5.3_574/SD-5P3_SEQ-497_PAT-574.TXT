 This patch will prevent the input date value from being accepted for the 
 RECALL DATE (#5) and RECALL DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) fields in the
 RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5) file if it is before the current date.
  
 This patch will fix the problem of allowing entry of a month and year
 for the recall dates that result in no letter printing.
  
 This patch will also disable the Conversion Menu [SDRR IRM MENU] options.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000391447 - Problems with fields in file #403.5 (Recall Reminders
                      file)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Currently, the system allows users to enter a past date in the RECALL
    DATE (#5) and the RECALL DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) fields in the RECALL
    REMINDERS (#403.5) file. This is to ensure that sites with the Class 
    III software can run the conversion routines without incident. However,
    after installation of this patch, these two fields should only allow
    users to enter a future date.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the INPUT TRANSFORM on the RECALL DATE (#5) and the RECALL 
    DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) fields in the RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5) file
    so that past dates cannot be entered.
  
  
 2. HD0000000509047 - Recall Reminder issue
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Currently, the system allows users to enter a month and year in the 
    RECALL DATE (#5) and the RECALL DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) fields in 
    the RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5) file that result in no letter printing.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified the INPUT TRANSFORM on the RECALL DATE (#5) and the RECALL
    DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) fields in the RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5) file 
    so that a future exact date must be entered.
  
  
 3. HD0000000766165 - Disabling conversion options
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When users run any of options listed under the Conversion Menu [SDRR
    IRM MENU] options and if there are any entries in the RECALL REMINDERS 
    (#403.5) file, issues will occur.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    This patch will disable the following options in Recall Reminder:
  
     Conversion Menu                        [SDRR IRM MENU]
     Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL PARAM [SDRR CONVERSION PARAMS FILE]
     Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL ...
     APPT TYPES                             [SDRR CON RECALL APPT TYPES]
     Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL ...
     TEAM                                   [SDRR CONVERSION TEAM FILE]
     Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL ...
     PROVIDERS                              [SDRR CONVERSION PROVIDER FILE]
     Convert OUTPATIENT CLINIC RECALL       [SDRR CONV OUTPATIENT RECALL]
  
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 This patch will allow entering a future date only for the RECALL DATE (#5)
 and RECALL DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5) in the RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5) 
 file; it will not alter the existing data for these two fields.
  
 The following is a list of fields included in this patch:
  
         Field Name (Number)                File Name (Number)
         -------------------                ------------------
         RECALL DATE (#5)                   RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5)
         RECALL DATE (PER PATIENT) (#5.5)   RECALL REMINDERS (#403.5)
  
  
 Software and Documentation Distribution:
 ========================================
 Sites may retrieve the documentation directly via FTP. The preferred 
 method is to FTP the file from:
  
         download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the 
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
  
 Albany:         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
 Hines:          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
