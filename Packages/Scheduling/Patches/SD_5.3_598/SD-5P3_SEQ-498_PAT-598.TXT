 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
  
 1)  HD0000000536058 - User has the ability to reactivate a patient to an
                       inactive team or position.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the PCMM Assign or Unassign protocol via the Appointment Management
 Module [SDAM APPT MGT] option, if the patient has been automatically
 inactivated, the user will receive a prompt to reactivate the patient to their
 previously assigned team and position. The system does not validate whether the
 previously assigned team and position are currently active or  not. The user   
 should not be able to assign a patient to an inactive team or position. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCMCQK has been modified to check the status of the patients previously
 assigned team and position. If either team or position is currently inactive
 the user will NOT be prompted for reactivation.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000709517 - User can reactivate a deceased patient to previously
                       assigned team and position.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the PCMM Assign or Unassign protocol via the Appointment Management
 Module [SDAM APPT MGT] option, if the patient has been automatically
 inactivated, the user will receive a prompt to reactivate the patient to their
 previously assigned team and position. If the patient is deceased the user
 should not be able to reassign that patient to their previously assigned team
 and position.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCMCQK has been modified to NOT prompt the user for reactivation if the
 patient is deceased.
  
  
 3)  HD0000000625873 - Historical Report of several Providers
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When running the Historical Provider Position Assignment Listing [SC PCMM HIST
 PROV ASSIGN LIST] option by a specific provider, no data is returned due
 to an incorrect variable name.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCRPO3 has been modified by correcting the variable name.
