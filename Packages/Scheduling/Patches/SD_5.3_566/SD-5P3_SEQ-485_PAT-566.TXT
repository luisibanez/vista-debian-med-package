Subject: MAKE CLINIC FIELD REQUIRED AND CORRECT RECALL PATIENT INQUIRY OPTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issues:
 1.  The CLINIC field(#4.5) in the RECALL REMINDERS file(#403.5)
     should be a "required" field.
  
 2.  Fix the problem with the Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY]
     option that prints the incorrect data, in the Inactive Recall
     Reminders section, for a user who entered the recall reminder.
  
 3.  Correct the Patient lookup for options Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient
     [SDRR CARD ADD] and Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY],
     which both allow a user to add a new patient to the PATIENT file(#2),
     if the selected patient is not found.
  
 4.  The Recall Patient Inquiry option [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY], indicates 
     all recall reminders for a patient have been sent, regardless of what
     the recall date is.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  HD0000000375545 - Change CLINIC field(#4.5) to be a "required" field.
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     Currently, when using option 'Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient'
     [SDRR CARD ADD] or the RR-Recall Reminder Action protocol in
     Appointment Management to add a recall reminder entry for a
     patient, the CLINIC field(#4.5) is optional.  When a clinic is not
     entered by the user, this causes the Recall Reminder cards/letters
     to not print.
  
     RESOLUTION:
     -----------
     The CLINIC field(#4.5) in the RECALL REMINDERS file(#403.5) will be
     changed to a "required" field.  Additionally, post-init routine
     SD53P566 will provide a report via Mailman to the person 
     installing the patch, identifying all Recall Reminder entries that do
     not currently have a clinic identified in CLINIC field(#4.5).  
     Subject of Mailman is:  RECALL REMINDERS MISSING REQUIRED CLINIC.
     This report should be shared with the facility Recall Reminder 
     Coordinator or other appropriate person.
     Furthermore, when a new recall reminder is being entered, the
     software creates the new record entry in the RECALL REMINDERS file
     (#403.5) via Input Template [SDRR RECALL CARD ADD].  Thus, the new
     record is immediately created.  So, if the user times out while at
     the Clinic prompt, a new record entry will be created even though
     the required CLINIC field(#4.5) and other remaining fields have not
     been entered.  Therefore, routines SDRR1 and SDRRCLR2 will be modified
     to check for a timeout during creation of a new recall reminder
     record.  If a timeout occurs, the new record entry just created will
     be deleted via FileMan API DIK and a message will be displayed letting
     the user know that the recall reminder was incomplete and therefore
     not filed.
  
 2.  HD0000000398329 - Recall Patient Inquiry is displaying "User Who
                       Entered Recall" field incorrectly
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     When the Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY] is run, 
     Inactive Recall Reminders incorrectly prints the user who deleted
     the recall entry as the user who entered the recall.  This only
     occurs with Inactive Recall Reminders.  Active Recall Reminders
     print the correct user in the User Who Entered Recall field(#7).
  
     RESOLUTION:
     -----------
     Routines SDRRINQ and SDRRINQ1 will be modified so that the user
     is correctly pulled from the User Who Entered Recall field(#7) in
     the RECALL REMINDERS REMOVED file(#403.56).
  
 3.  HD0000000424636 - Recall allows a patient to be entered into Patient
                       file
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     When using menu options Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient [SDRR CARD ADD]
     and Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY], if the selected
     patient is not found in the PATIENT file(#2), the user is allowed to
     add the patient to the PATIENT file(#2).  This should never be
     allowed through Recall Reminder options.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routines SDRRCLR2 and SDRRINQ were both making calls to routine DPTLK
     to do a patient lookup.  Both routines have been modified to use
     Fileman API DIC to do the patient lookup, so that the user will not be
     allowed to add the patient to the PATIENT file(#2) if the selected
     patient is not found.
  
 4.  HD0000000425631 - Recall Patient Inquiry quirk
  
     PROBLEM:
     --------
     When using the option Recall Patient Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY],
     it will indicate that all recall reminders have been sent for the
     selected patient regardless of how far into the future the recall date
     in the RECALL REMINDERS file(#403.5) is.  A FileMan inquiry into the
     RECALL REMINDERS file(#403.5) for the selected patient shows the Date
     Reminder Sent field(#6) is null for those reminders with future dates
     that should not have printed yet, i.e., they are beyond the Auto Print
     Days field(#3) set in the RECALL REMINDERS PARAMETERS file(#403.53).
     So, the problem is just a display issue with the Recall Patient
     Inquiry [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY] option.
  
     RESOLUTION:
     -----------
     Routines SDRRINQ and SDRRINQ1 will be modified so that all variables
     are properly killed and reset.  Once fixed, the Recall Patient Inquiry
     [SDRR PATIENT INQUIRY] option will properly display either the Date
     Reminder Sent or NOTSENT, whichever applies.
