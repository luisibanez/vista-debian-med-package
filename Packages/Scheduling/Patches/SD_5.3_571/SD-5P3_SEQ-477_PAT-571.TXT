 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000371946 - Security Key for Providers
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When adding a provider to the RECALL REMINDERS PROVIDERS file (#403.54)
    via menu option Edit/Add Clinic Recall Provider [SDRR ADD RECALL
    PROVIDER], the provider can be set up with a security key (which is
    optional) in the KEY field (#6).  This is a locally created and named
    security key that is used solely for this purpose.  Each site can
    create this security key via menu option Key Management [XUKEYMGMT] and
    it gets added to the SECURITY KEY file (#19.1).  When a provider is set
    up with a security key, any actions (adds, edits or deletes) taken on
    recall reminders for that provider should be restricted to users who
    possess the security key.  Presently, the edit functionality in menu
    option Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient [SDRR CARD ADD] does restrict
    users without the security key from making edits to recall reminders
    for any providers set up with the security key.  However, the option
    allows any users to add new recall reminders for those same
    providers, when it should restrict users without the security key.
    Additionally, when recall reminders are deleted/cancelled via menu
    option Delete/Cancel Clinic Recall Entry [SDRR DELETE RECALL], it
    allows any users to perform this action even on recall reminders
    for providers assigned a security key.  Again, it should restrict
    users who do not hold the security key from taking this action on
    recall reminders for providers assigned a security key.
        
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Input Template SDRR RECALL CARD ADD for the RECALL REMINDERS file
    (#403.5) will be updated to call a new API (Application Programming
    Interface) called SCREEN(), that has been added to routine SDRRUTL.
    This new API will screen to check if the provider selected by the
    user has been assigned the security key and whether the user holds
    that security key.  If the user does not hold the security key, the
    following warning message will be displayed:
  
         Provider selected is assigned Security Key
         which you do not hold.
         Please contact your Recall Coordinator.
  
         No Recall Record created.
  
    By design, a user is not allowed to perform an early exit (up-arrow
    out) at any point, once they start to create a new Recall entry.  So,
    if the user selects a provider assigned a security key, which the
    user does not hold, the above warning message will be displayed and
    the user will be immediately exited from the option.  Otherwise, they
    will be forced to enter another provider in order to exit the option.
    In addition, new Exit Actions will be added to the standalone menu
    option Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient [SDRR CARD ADD] in the OPTION
    file (#19) and to the Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] protocol
    Recall Reminder Action [SDRR EVENT] in the PROTOCOL file (#101) to
    insure the partially created record is properly deleted from the
    RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5).
  
    The current software for editing existing recall reminders, already
    screens to insure the user holds the security key, if the provider
    assigned to the selected recall reminder is assigned the security key
    and does not allow the user to edit, when applicable.  However, if
    the user selects an existing recall reminder for a provider who is not
    assigned the security key, the current software does not prevent the
    user from changing the provider to another provider who is assigned
    the security key, which the user does not hold.  In this situation,
    the user will be presented with the following warning message and then
    re-prompted for the provider:
  
  
         Provider selected is assigned Security Key
         which you do not hold.
         Please contact your Recall Coordinator.
  
    The current software permits users to do an early exit (up-arrow out)
    when performing edits, so in this situation the user will not be
    immediately exited and the existing Recall Entry will not be deleted.
    
    Routine SDRRDEL will also be modified so that when a security key is
    assigned to a provider, only users holding that key will be able to
    delete/cancel recall reminders for the provider via option
    Delete/Cancel Clinic Recall Entry [SDRR DELETE RECALL].
  
    If a user does not hold the security key, the following warning 
    message will be displayed:
  
             THE PROVIDER ASSIGNED TO THIS RECALL REMINDER IS
             ASSIGNED A SECURITY KEY WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE.
             PLEASE CONTACT YOUR RECALL COORDINATOR.
  
  
 2) HD0000000392624 - Recall Reminder not showing on CPRS cover sheet
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When more than two recall reminders are entered for a patient for the
    same recall date, only the first one entered and the last one entered
    display on the CPRS cover sheet.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDRROR will be modified so that when more than two recall
    reminders are entered for a patient for the same recall date, they
    will all display on the CPRS cover sheet.
  
 3) HD0000000445051 - Able to enter inactive providers
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When adding a new recall reminder to the RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5)
    a user can select a provider who has been inactivated in the RECALL
    REMINDERS PROVIDERS file (#403.54).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Input Template SDRR RECALL CARD ADD for the RECALL REMINDERS file
    (#403.5) will be updated to call a new API (Application Programming
    Interface) called SCREEN(), that has been added to routine SDRRUTL.
    This new API will screen to check if the provider selected by the
    user has been Inactivated in the RECALL REMINDERS PROVIDERS file
    (#403.54).  If the selected provider has been Inactivated, the
    following warning message will be displayed:
  
         Provider selected is Inactive.
         Please contact your Recall Coordinator.
  
         No Recall Record created.
  
    By design, a user is not allowed to perform an early exit (up-arrow
    out) at any point, once they start to create a new Recall entry.  So,
    if the user selects a provider who has been Inactivated, the above
    warning message will be displayed and the user will be immediately
    exited from the option.  Otherwise, the user will be forced to enter
    another provider in order to exit the option.
    In addition, new Exit Actions will be added to the standalone menu
    option Add/Edit Clinic Recall Patient [SDRR CARD ADD] in the OPTION
    file (#19) and to the Appointment Management [SDAM APPT MGT] protocol
    Recall Reminder Action [SDRR EVENT] in the PROTOCOL file (#101) to
    insure the partially created record is properly deleted from the
    RECALL REMINDERS file (#403.5).
  
    The current software permits users to do an early exit (up-arrow out)
    when performing edits to existing recall reminders.  So, if the user
    attempts to edit the provider and selects an Inactive provider or is
    editing a pre-existing, active recall entry for an Inactive provider
    and try to accept that provider as the default, the following
    warning message will display and the user will be re-prompted to
    select the provider:
  
         Provider selected is Inactive.
         Please contact your Recall Coordinator.
  
    In this situation, the existing recall entry will not be deleted if
    the user does an early exit.
