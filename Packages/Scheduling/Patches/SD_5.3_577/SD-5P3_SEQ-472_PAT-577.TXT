 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 HD0000000347133 - $ZE= <UNDEFINED>EN+15^SCENIA0 *SCINF("DFN")
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Occasionally, an undefined error occurs when using the Correct Incomplete
 Encounters [SCENI IEMM ERROR CORRECTION] menu option.  This is 
 because routine SCENIA0 makes an extrinsic function call to API
 OPENC^SCUTIE1, which is designed to return the flag equal to a 
 negative one and create and return an error message in local array, SCINF
 when no records are found, as follows:
  
 SCINF("ERROR")= "No (Deleted) Outpatient Encounter entry found."
  
 However, the calling routine (SCENIA0) is not checking for this possible 
 value being returned.  Instead, it is assuming a record was found and 
 that local array, SCINF, was built containing various pieces of data 
 extracted from that record, such as the patient DFN.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCENIA0 will be modified to check if the flag (variable SDFLG) 
 was returned as a negative one (-1) and local array, SCINF("ERROR") is 
 defined. When this is true, it will display the following message to the 
 user and quit:
  
 No (Deleted) Outpatient Encounter entry found.
  
  
 TECHNICAL:
 ==========
  
 Current Code in routine SCENIA0
 -------------------------------
  
 S SDFLG=$$OPENC^SCUTIE(SDXPTR,"SCINF")
 ;
 S DFN=SCINF("DFN")
  
  
 Modified Code in routine SCENIA0
 --------------------------------
  
 S SDFLG=$$OPENC^SCUTIE(SDXPTR,"SCINF")
 I SDFLG=-1,$D(SCINF("ERROR")) W !!,$G(SCINF("ERROR")) H 3 K SCINF Q
 ;
 S DFN=SCINF("DFN")
  
 This will display the appropriate message to the user and quit:
  
 No (Deleted) Outpatient Encounter entry found.
