Description:
============

 This patch provides Fiscal Year 2013 updates to the CLINIC STOP (#40.7) 
 file as requested by the Decision Support Office (DSO).
  
                         ***IMPORTANT NOTE: ***
 **************************************************************************
 ** This patch should be installed as close to COB on September 30, 2012 **
 ** as possible, but not after the start of business on October 1, 2012. **
 ** Early installation of this patch could result in transmission of     **
 ** incorrect stop codes that will result in errors from Austin.         **
 ** Coordination with theMAS (Medical Administration Service) PAS        **
 ** (Program Application Specialist)/ADPAC is imperative, as the patch   **
 ** will cause changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).  Testing can be  **
 ** done in a site's mirror account before installation in production to **
 ** verify changes.                                                      **
 **                                                                      **
 ** This patch inactivates, creates and modifies descriptions of stop    **
 ** codes effective October 1, 2012, therefore, installing early may     **
 ** modify certain stop codes that may currently be in use at your site. **
 ** It is advised that clinics with stop codes assigned that will        **
 ** incur restriction date/type changes should be corrected as soon as   **
 ** possible after installation.  Please keep in mind that new stop      **
 ** code corrections cannot be assigned until October 1, 2012.           **
 ** All other stop code corrections should be made as early as possible  **
 ** on October 1, 2012.  Sites need to coordinate their DSS CLINICS AND  **
 ** STOP CODES file (#728.44) worksheet maintenance to save the latest   **
 ** FY2012 values (as of Sep 30, 2012), and then not change the work-    **
 ** sheet to have FY2013 values until after the DSS Clinic (CLI)         **
 ** extract for September data has run successfully.                     **

 DSS Instructions for FY13 Stop Code Patch (SD*5.3*596):
 =======================================================
 This patch makes additions and changes to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) as 
 of October 1, 2012.
  
    - No clinic can be created using any of the new or reactivated Stop 
      Codes contained in the patch until after this patch is implemented.
    - Any clinics using a Stop Code inactivated by the patch should have an
      active Stop Code assigned.  Assigning appropriate active Stop Codes 
      to clinics can be accomplished prior to patch implementation if
      desired (as long as an active appropriate Stop Code to use already
      exists in the file).
  
 DSS Site Teams and Scheduling and IRM should coordinate to perform the
 following sequence:
  
 1)  Before IRM installs patch SD*5.3*596, toward the end of September,
     DSS should run the DSS worksheet option CREATE DSS CLINIC STOP FILE 
     [ECXSCLOAD]. Then right at the end of September, but before the patch
     is installed, make any necessary adjustments before approval so all
     clinics on the worksheet have setups applicable for the month of
     September 2012.
  
 2)  IRM installs the patch late on September 30, or very early on 
     October 1, 2012.
  
 3)  Run the Non-Conforming Clinics Stop Code Report [SD CLN STOP CODE REP]
     option to list those clinics that need changes in the HOSPITAL
     LOCATION file (#44) for FY13.  Work with Scheduling staff to make
     changes in HOSPICTAL LOCATION file (#44) so that the clinics
     will have the correct stop codes in place for FY13 clinic 
     appointments.  Do not make changes using Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for
     CLINICS AND STOP CODES file (#728.44) at this time.
  
 4)  Follow normal procedures to run the DSS CLI Extract for September 
     2012.  Updates should not be made for October stop code changes with
     the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option prior to
     running the September CLI Extract.  Perform normal Audits for the CLI
     Extract.
  
 5)  After auditing the September CLI Extract, and after making any 
     necessary changes and transmitting the CLI Extract, proceed with FY13
     Stop Code changes to the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Worksheet clinics:
  
     a) Use the Create DSS Clinic Stop Code File [ECXSCLOAD] option to run
        the Print "Unreviewed Clinics".
     b) Update the FY13 as needed using the Enter/Edit DSS Stop Codes for 
        Clinics [ECXSCEDIT] option.
     c) Approve changes using the Approve Reviewed DSS Clinic Worksheet 
        [ECXSCAPPROV] option. Finalize all Stop Code changes on the
        worksheet to be ready to run the monthly FY13 DSS CLI Extracts.

 Problem:
 --------
 The Stop Code Council, through the Decision Support Office (DSO), has 
 requested Fiscal Year 2013 updates to the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The requested Fiscal Year 2013 updates were submitted by the DSO to be 
 implemented effective October 1, 2012.  Post-init routine SD53FY13 
 updates the CLINIC STOP file (#40.7) by adding eight (8) new stop codes, 
 inactivating eight (8) existing stop codes, reactivating and changing
 the names of four (4) stop codes (plus changing the restriction data for
 3 of these), changing the names for two (2) stop codes and changing the
 restriction data for one (1) stop code.  A total of 23 stop codes are
 being updated with this patch.

 The 3 digit numbers noted after the name of the Stop Codes above are the
 IEN for the Stop Codes and are NOT the AMIS reporting Stop Code
 number. For example, Angiogram Catheterization is Stop Code 152 and its
 Internal Entry Number is 338.  Also, please note that IENs differ from
