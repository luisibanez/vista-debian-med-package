 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================= 
 1.  HD0000000516051 - Future Assignments.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the Mass Team/Position Unassignment [SCMC MU MASS TEAM
 UNASSIGNMENT], if a user unassigns a patient that has a future date
 assignment, the following undefined error occurs:"<UNDEFINED>DIK+3^DIK".
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCMCMU2 has been modified so when unassigning a patient using the
 Mass Team/Position Unassignment [SCMC MU MASS TEAM UNASSIGNMENT] option,
 an error will no longer occur.
  
  
 2.  HD0000000254727 - The users does not receive a warning message stating
                       the patient is deceased.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When selecting a deceased patient using the Team/Position 
 Assignment/Re-Assignment [SCMC PATIENT ASSIGN/UNASSIGN] option, a warning
 message is not displayed notifying the user that the patient is deceased
 nor questions the user if they would like to continue.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCMCQK has been modified to check if the patient is deceased.
 If the patient is deceased a message will display, warning the user that
 the patient is deceased and asks if they would like to continue. PCMM
 allows users to assign a deceased patient to a team with the assignment
 date prior to patient's date of death for historical purposes.
  
  
 3.  HD0000000591991 - User can assign a patient to a team after the date
                       of death of the patient.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users are allowed to assign deceased patients to teams after or equal to 
 their date of death when using the Team/Position Assignment/Re-Assignment 
 [SCMC PATIENT ASSIGN/UNASSIGN] option.  A patient should only be assigned
 to a team if the assignment date is prior to their date of death.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines SCMCQK1 and SCMCQK2 have been modified so that a patient can
 only be assigned to a team if the assignment date is before but not 
 equal to their date of death.
   
 4.  HD0000000716546 - <UNDEFINED>READ+2^SCMCQK2 *DATA(0)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the PCMM Assign or Unassign protocol via the Appointment
 Management Module [SDAM APPT MGT] option, if a user answers "No", at the
 prompt, "Do you want to make a primary care assignment/unassignment?
 Yes//", and then enters a "^^", at the following prompt requesting the 
 user to enter a response, the following undefined error occurs
 <UNDEFINED>READ+2^SCMCQK2 *DATA(0).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine SCMCQK2 has been modified to handle the input of a, "^^", at the 
 response prompt and the error no longer occurs.
