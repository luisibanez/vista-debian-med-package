Subject: FIX NO-SHOW/CANX DT/TIME, NO SHOW RPT AND APPT LIST ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix the following issues:
  
 - A problem occasionally occurs when an appointment is cancelled,
   where the date/time being filed for this action is incorrect.
 - The No Show report [SD NOSHOW REPORT], is calculating 'No Action
   Taken' appointments in the total number of no shows for the selected
   date range.
 - Report headings are not printing on the Appointment List [SDLIST]. In 
   addition, if a clinic is Inactive, the report displays 'No activity,
   which can be viewed as misleading.

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000425348 - No-Show/Cancel time minutes occasionally incorrect
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Occasionally, when an appointment is cancelled, the date/time filed in
    the NO-SHOW/CANCEL DATE/TIME field (#15) of the APPOINTMENT sub-file
    (#2.98) in the PATIENT file (#2) will be incorrect. This occurs because
    the existing code for rounding off the time is wrong.  Thus, if the
    time happens to be the 59th minute and half a second of an hour, the
    time is getting rounded off and filed wrong. For example, if the time
    is 105950, it is getting filed as 1060, instead of 11.  The date/time
    filed for no-shows is not rounded off, so this issue only occurs with
    appointment cancellations.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The $JUSTIFY function being used to set and file the date/time in
    routine SDCNP0, will be corrected so that the time is correctly rounded
    and filed.
  
 2) HD0000000479224 - Is there a coding error in routine SDNOS0
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When a user runs the No Show report [SD NOSHOW REPORT], they are given
    the option to include appointment information for appointments that 
    have No Action Taken.  Although the report does correctly include these
    appointments in the report, the total number of no shows at the end of
    the report includes the total number of 'No Action Taken' appointments
    for the selected date range.  The total should be for 'No Shows' only.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SDNOS0 will be modified so that the 'No Show' total at the end
    of the report only counts appointments that have actually been 'No
    Showed' and does not include "No Action Taken' appointments in that
    total.
  
 3) HD0000000498727 - Appointment List not showing clinic name
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the Appointment List [SDLIST] for one clinic, the clinic
    name does not print in the report header when the selected date is a
    date for which the clinic has not been set up with availability or the
    clinic was Inactive on the selected date.  In either case, the clinic
    name does not print in the report header and the output statement
    indicates: "No activity found for this date!".
    Additionally, if you run the report for All clinics or a list of
    clinics, and none of the clinics happen to have any appointments
    scheduled for the selected date, the report header just prints:
  
    Appointments for DAY OF THE WEEK, date
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routines SDAL and SDAL0 will be modified so that when you run the
    Appointment List [SDLIST] for a single clinic and the clinic does
    not have availability or was Inactive on the selected date, the
    clinic name will print in the report header.  Additionally, the
    output statement will be changed to be more explicit, so it will
    read either "No Clinic Availability for this date!" or "Clinic
    Inactive on this date!", whichever applies.
    Additionally, if the report if run for All clinics or a list of
    clinics, and none of the clinics happen to have any appointments
    scheduled for the selected date, the report header will be changed
    to read whichever applies:
  
    Appointments for ALL clinics for DAY OF THE WEEK, date
  
    <or>
  
    Appointments for Selected clinics for DAY OF THE WEEK, date
