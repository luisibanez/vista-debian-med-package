 OPTION file (#19) for ACRP menu option Retransmit Ambulatory Care Data by

 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1) HD0000000442518 - UNDEFINED>OEOU+3^SCRPW24
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Occasionally, when a user runs the ACRP Ad Hoc Report [SCRPW AD
    HOC REPORT], and selects Option Used to Create as an additional
    print field, an undefined error will occur because the
    Option Used to Create field (#.24) is null in the VISIT file
    (#9000010).
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine SCRPW24 will be modified so that when a null value exists
    for the Option Used to Create field (#.24) the report will print
    "Unknown" and thus prevent this error from occurring.
  
 2) HD0000000464638 - Letters transposed in description?
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the description field of the OPTION file (#19) for ACRP option
    Retransmit Ambulatory Care Data by Date Range [SCDX AMBCAR
    RETRANS BY DATE], the last sentence references the ACRP nightly
    background job option, but has the letters transposed, i.e.:
  
    Currently:  SDCX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT
                 ==
  
    Should Be:  SCDX AMBCAR NIGHTLY XMIT
                 ==
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The transposed letters in the option description of the OPTION file
    (#19) for ACRP option Retransmit Ambulatory Care Data by Date
    Range [SCDX AMBCAR RETRANS BY DATE] will be corrected with this
    patch.
