Description:
============

  
 This patch, SD*5.3*578, is being released in a single 
 Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) software
 distribution (host file).  This patch message contains the informational
 portion of SD*5.3*578 and provides field personnel with instructions on
 how to acquire, install, and implement the patch software.
 *************************************************************************
  
  
 This patch is in support of the Improve Veteran Mental
 Health (IVMH) initiative, High Risk Mental Health (HRMH)
 - Reminder Patient List Reporting. This patch implements
 two new Scheduling No Show reports to display 
 information in support of the HRMH initiatives.  
 This list of patients will support Reminder Patient List
 reporting needs for how many of the 
 High Risk for Suicide PRF patients of record
 had a NO-SHOW during a reporting period.
  
  
 The new High Risk MH No-Show Adhoc Report [SD MH NO SHOW AD HOC REPORT]
 option will display all patients that no showed for their scheduled 
 appointment for a Mental Health clinic.  The user is asked for the date 
 range and divisions to display and the report is sorted by Clinic, Mental 
 Health only clinics or Stop Codes. The report will display patient contact
 information, Next of Kin, emergency contact, clinic default
 provider, Mental Health Team Coordinator(MHTC)(future release),
 future scheduled appointments and results of attempts
 to contact the no showed patients (future release).
  
 The High Risk MH No-Show Nightly Report [SD MH NO SHOW NIGHTLY BGJ]
 is called by the scheduling nightly background job
 Appointment Status Update (Background)[SDAM BACKGROUND JOB].
 This report will display all patients that no showed
 for their scheduled appointment for a Mental Health clinic.  
 This will be an abbreviated report, listing only
 Patient appointment information and future scheduled
 appointments for the patient. As this is a background
 job, the report will display for the day before, for all the
 divisions and mental health clinics in the facility. 
 The report will be sent via email to members of the
 SD MH NO SHOW NOTIFICATION mail group.
 This report can also be run by calling the option
 No Show Nightly Background Job [SD MH NO SHOW NIGHTLY BGJ].
  
 Access to these two new options should be assigned to the appropriate
 personnel.
