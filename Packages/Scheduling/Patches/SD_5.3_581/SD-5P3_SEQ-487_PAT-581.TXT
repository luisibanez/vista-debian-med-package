Description:
============

 This patch includes a new GUI executable.
  
 This patch will address issues related to the Primary Care Management 
 Module (PCMM). Enhancements in this patch will provide improved 
 patient-to-provider, non-primary care tracking capability and improve 
 overall patient care. The modifications and enhancements to PCMM are as
 follows:
  
   1. The PRIMARY CARE FTEE EQUIVALENT field (#.09) located in the 
      POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY file (#404.52) will be renamed to the
      FTEE EQUIVALENT field (#.09). This will now allow PCMM the ability
      to store Capacity and FTEE values for all roles in PCMM including:
      Primary and Non-Primary care teams, by entering and retrieving them
      in the PCMM GUI.
      
       - Non-Primary care Provider position or a position on a non-primary
         care team will not require entry of an FTEE value when staffed
         originally.
       - If an FTEE value is entered on any staffed position, it cannot be
         removed completely but it can be changed to another value as
         accepted.
       - The staffed position that already has a FTEE value can have that
         value deleted, only if the staffed person is INACTIVATED. This
         happens automatically as a new, inactive entry is created in the
         POSITION ASSIGNMENT HISTORY file (#404.52).
  
   2. The current VistA report option, Direct PC FTEE and Panel Size 
      Report [SC PCMM DIRECT PC FTEE], displays the Primary Care Providers
      that are setup in the Primary Care Team positions as well as other
      staff members from other teams.  For accuracy, the report title and
      several column titles should be corrected to reflect the data
      contents.
  
      In summary the following modifications have been made:
  
      a) The menu option for the "DIRECT PC FTEE AND PANEL SIZE REPORT" [SC
         PCMM DIRECT PC FTEE] has been changed to "FTEE AND PANEL SIZE
         REPORT" [SC FTEE AND PANEL SIZE REPORT].  The report title is now
         FTEE AND PANEL SIZE.
      b) Column #2's title has been changed from "PC Team" to "Team".
      c) Column #3's title has been changed from "Provider's Team Position"
         to "Team Position".
      d) Column #4 will display a "blank" if the provider is not a PCP or
         AP.
      e) Column #6's title has been changed from "Direct PC FTEE" to
         "FTEE".
      f) Modifications to the Report Key located below the report, will 
         also be altered to reflect the new changes on the report.

     PCMM.EXE will replace the existing PCMM.EXE which is
     usually found in the Program File/VISTA/PCMM directory of the client
     workstation. Workstations without an existing PCMM GUI application
     installed should first download and run SD_53_P204.EXE to install the
     previous version of PCMM. Then the PCMM.EXE should be replaced with
     the new version.
