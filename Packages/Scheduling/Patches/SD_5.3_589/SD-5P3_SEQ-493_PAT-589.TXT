Description:
============

 This patch was developed in support of the Improve Veterans Mental 
 Health (IVMH), Identification of Principal Mental Health Provider 
 (IPMHP) project. In support of new Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) 
 functionality introduced in patch SD*5.3*575, this patch provides 
 reporting capability to Mental Health Service within PCMM software. Four 
 new Mental Health PCMM reports were created along with a Mental Health 
 PCMM Reports Menu. These reports will assist Mental Health Service in 
 implementing and maintaining Mental Health patients within the PCMM 
 software. Also, a new file is included in this patch; this file will 
 contain Stop Codes used by Mental Health Service. The Stop Codes listed 
 in the MH PCMM STOP CODES file (#404.61) are needed by one report to 
 produce output. This patch will include release notes with detail
 descriptions of the new reports and output.
  
 This patch addresses new NSR20080514.
