 Enhancements
 =====================
  
 The enhancement in this patch provides an alert to the pharmacist 
 in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 when no allergy assessment is on
 file for the patient, and a method for the pharmacist to enter an
 allergy assessment after receiving the alert.  A pharmacy intervention
 is automatically created if the pharmacist chooses to not enter an
 assessment.
  
   ** NOTE: The new NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT interventions will 
            not be logged until patch PSS*1*171 is installed.        
  
 The No Allergy Assessment functionality will be available at the
 following options:
  
 Inpatient Order Entry [PSJ OE]
 Non-Verified/Pending Orders [PSJU VBW]
 Order Entry [PSJU NE]
 Order Entry (IV) [PSJI ORDER]
 Profile (IV) [PSJI PROFILE]
  
 When a patient with no allergy assessment is selected from one of the
 affected options, the following message will be displayed to the
 pharmacist:
  
 "NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter
 one now?"
  
   - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
        for allergy information.
   - If the pharmacist enters 'NO' at this prompt, a pharmacist
     intervention is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY
     ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is then prompted for Provider
     and Recommendation. A new Recommendation, 'UNABLE TO ASSESS',
     has been created specifically for this type of intervention.
  
  
 This enhancement will address Patient Safety Issue PSPO 445.
