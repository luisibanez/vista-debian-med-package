"BLD",8211,1,25,0)
pharmacist in Inpatient Medications V. 5.0 when no allergy assessment is
"BLD",8211,1,26,0)
on file for the patient, and a method for the pharmacist to enter an
"BLD",8211,1,27,0)
allergy assessment after receiving the alert.  A pharmacy intervention
"BLD",8211,1,28,0)
is automatically created if the pharmacist chooses to not enter an
"BLD",8211,1,29,0)
assessment.
"BLD",8211,1,30,0)
 
"BLD",8211,1,31,0)

"BLD",8211,1,44,0)
 
"BLD",8211,1,45,0)
"NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter
"BLD",8211,1,46,0)
one now?"
"BLD",8211,1,47,0)
 
"BLD",8211,1,48,0)
 - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
"BLD",8211,1,49,0)
   for allergy information.
"BLD",8211,1,50,0)

"BLD",8211,1,51,0)
   is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is
"BLD",8211,1,52,0)
   then prompted for Provider and Recommendation. A new Recommendation,

When a patient with no allergy assessment is selected from one of the
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,42,0)
affected options, the following message will be displayed to the
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,43,0)
pharmacist:
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,44,0)
 
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,45,0)
"NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT exists for this patient! Would you like to enter

one now?"
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,47,0)
 
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,48,0)
 - If the pharmacist enters 'YES' at this prompt, they are prompted
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,49,0)
   for allergy information.
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,50,0)
 - If the pharmacist enters 'NO' at this prompt, a pharmacist intervention
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,51,0)
   is created, with a type of 'NO ALLERGY ASSESSMENT'. The pharmacist is
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,52,0)
   then prompted for Provider and Recommendation. A new Recommendation,
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,53,0)
   'UNABLE TO ASSESS', has been created specifically  for this type of
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,54,0)
   intervention.
"PKG",517,22,1,"PAH",1,1,55,0)
