Description:
============

 This patch is being released in preparation for the medication routes
 enhancement patch PSS*1*159. This patch contains the following:
  
  - The MED ROUTE field (#.06) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)
    is renamed DEFAULT MED ROUTE.
  
  - The POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) is added to the PHARMACY
    ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7). This multiple is pointing to the
    MEDICATION ROUTES file (#51.2).
  
  - The USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is added to the PHARMACY
    ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) with YES/NO values.
  
 The above fields will be available when editing an existing or adding a 
 new orderable item using the following options:
   - Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS]
   - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
   - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
     ITEMS]
  
 The Default Med Route For OI Report [PSS DEF MED ROUTE OI RPT] option
 is modified to include printing of the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple.
  
 In addition, a post install routine will run to update the USE DOSAGE
 FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) based on the value of the DEFAULT MED
 ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7). The
 USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) will be exported with "YES"
 for sites that have the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) set to
 NO. Otherwise, the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) will be 
 set to NO.
