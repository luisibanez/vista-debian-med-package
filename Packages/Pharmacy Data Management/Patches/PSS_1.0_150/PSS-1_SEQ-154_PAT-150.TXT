Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 1) In Outpatient Pharmacy, when the Drug Unit contains a slash the dosage
    is not being calculated correctly internally. The second part of the
    slash needs to be updated by the multiplier.
  
  
 2) Prevent the non-editable field IV FLAG (#.03) in the PHARMACY 
    ORDERABLE ITEM FILE (#50.7) from displaying when attempting to edit 
    via Fileman.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000233174 - Pharmacy Dose Call issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
  In Outpatient Pharmacy, when the Drug Unit contains a slash the 
  dosage is not being calculated correctly internally. The second part 
  of the slash needs to be updated by the multiplier.
  
     Example:
   This is how the Possible Dosages appear when they are viewed:
   POSSIBLE DOSAGES:
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 1         DOSE: 0.4MG/1SPRAY    PACKAGE: IO
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 2         DOSE: 0.8MG/2SPRAY    PACKAGE: IO
  
   This is how Outpatient Pharmacy currently calculates them internally:
  
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 1         0.4MG/SPRAY
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 2         0.8MG/SPRAY
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  The design of the calculation is the same for outpatient and 
  inpatient, but the way the data is stored differs. The calculation 
  needs to be corrected to account for the different data set sent by 
  outpatient.
               
  This patch will change the calculation so that the second part of the
  unit is updated by the dispense unit multiplier.  (Note: This is not
  displayed to the user in Outpatient Pharmacy, it is an internal
  calculation.)
  
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 1         0.4MG/SPRAY
    DISPENSE UNITS PER DOSE: 2         0.8MG/2SPRAY
  
 Technical:
 ----------
  Modify routine PSSORPH to convert the DRUG UNITS IEN stored by 
  outpatient in the dose array to the actual dose, before running the 
  calculation. The current system checks for a "/" and if one is found 
  the calculation is run. Outpatient Pharmacy stores the IEN 
  instead of the actual DRUG UNITS so the calculation never takes place. 
  
  
 2) HD0000000344317 - IV Flag
  
 Problem:
 --------
  The IV Flag in the Pharmacy Orderable Item file should not be able to 
  be edited via Fileman. This is an old field that is no longer used 
  after CPRS/Pharmacy Ordering Enhancements was implemented. Currently, 
  you can set the IV Flag via Fileman, but once it is set, you cannot 
  remove it via Fileman.  Once set, you cannot get to the pharmacy 
  orderable item entry via the PDM options.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  The write access for the IV Flag field will be disabled by updating the 
  Data Dictionary for the PHARMACY  ORDERABLE ITEM FILE (#50.7), field IV 
  FLAG (#.03)".
  
  Post-init routine PSSP150 will update the Data Dictionary with this 
  change.  Depending on your system's Kernel Parameter settings, this
  routine may be automatically deleted when the patch is installed. 
  
  
 Technical:
 ----------
  Stuffing an up-carrot "^" into the write access of the IV Flag field
  definition will prevent it from showing up for edit in fileman.
