Subject: MED ROUTE ENHANCEMENT FOR CPRS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This enhancement, approved by the Pharmacy Legacy Enhancement (PLE) User
 Group, will resolve Patient Safety Issue PSI-08-026/PSPO #852 reported in
 Remedy Ticket HD233682. This patch will activate the functionality 
 associated with the fields introduced with patch PSS*1*153.
  
  
 This patch will help mitigate incorrect medication routes being displayed
 for selection in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0.
 This enhancement affects Inpatient Medications unit dose orders, IV Fluids
 orders, and Outpatient Pharmacy orders entered via CPRS orders dialog.
  
 The pharmacy Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2418 is modified
 to return appropriate medication routes for the orderable item in CPRS
 ordering dialog with the following conditions.
  
 Note: The fields referenced below are from the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
       file (#50.7):
  
   1. ICR Modifications
    - Default Med Route
      It will be derived from the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06) if it's
      populated or from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) if it's
      populated with a single entry and the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST
      field (#10) is set to "NO."
  
    - Optional Med Routes
      The medication route selection list in CPRS will be populated with
      entries from the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple (#50.711) if the USE
      DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to "NO." Otherwise, it
      will be populated from the medication routes associated with the
      orderable item's dosage form, which is the current logic.
  
  2. The logic for editing the medication route has been modified in the 
     following options:
      - Edit Orderable Items [PSS EDIT ORDERABLE ITEMS]
      - Drug Enter/Edit [PSS DRUG ENTER/EDIT]
      - Dispense Drug/Orderable Item Maintenance [PSS MAINTAIN ORDERABLE
        ITEMS]
  
     The software will now ensure that the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06)
     of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) is either defined and/or
     at least one entry is defined in the POSSIBLE MED ROUTES multiple
     (#50.711) or the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to
     YES so that the medication route selection during order entry is
     listed appropriately.
  
     Note: This patch will change USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field
           (#10) of the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) from not
           required to a required field. This field will be used to
           determine the medication route selection during order entry.
           The post-install routine will loop through the PHARMACY
           ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) and check if the USE DOSAGE FORM MED
           ROUTE LIST field (#10) is set to "NO". If it is set to "NO", and
           the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field (#.06) is not populated and there
           are no POSSIBLE MED ROUTES field (#11) populated then it will
           set the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10) to "YES" so
           that the MED ROUTES from the DOSAGE FORM will continue to
           display in CPRS for selection. A report with a list of the
           Pharmacy Orderable Items that were changed will be captured and
           sent as a MailMan message to the installer and other users
           indicated during the installation process. It is important that
           the Pharmacy ADPAC or designee review these settings, and make
           changes as appropriate to use the functionality introduced with
           this patch.
  
  3. The Pharmacy System Parameters Edit [PSS SYS EDIT] option is modified
     to remove the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) of the 
     PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) from the list of fields that can be
     edited.

 Patch Installation: 
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 - The environment check routine PSS159EN will prompt the patch installer
   to enter at least one person, (other than the installer), to receive the
   mail message when the post-install routine has completed. This person
   should be the Pharmacy ADPAC or a designee.
  
 - The post-install routine will loop through the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM
   file (#50.7) and check if the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field (#10)
   is set to "NO". If it is set to "NO", and the DEFAULT MED ROUTE field
   (#.06) is not populated and there are no POSSIBLE MED ROUTES field (#11)
   populated then it will set the USE DOSAGE FORM MED ROUTE LIST field
   (#10) to "YES" so that the MED ROUTES from the DOSAGE FORM will continue
   to display in CPRS for selection. A report with a list of the Pharmacy
   Orderable Items that were changed will be captured and sent as a MailMan
   message to the installer and other users indicated during the
   installation process.
  
 - The post-install routine will delete the data and data dictionary of
   the DEFAULT MED ROUTE FOR CPRS field (#80.7) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM 
   file (#59.7) as we're using new logic in this patch to provide the
   appropriate medication route to CPRS.
  
 - The environment check routine PSS159EN and the post-install routine
   PSSP159 will be deleted at the end of patch installation.
