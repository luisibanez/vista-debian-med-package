Description:
============

 ****************************** Note **************************************
 This patch is a follow-up patch for Medication Order Check Healthcare 
 Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  The MOCHA v1.0 patches are being released as a 
 phased implementation release.  To see current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites should have received instructions and guidance on the installation 
 of MOCHA v1.0 as it is a phased implementation. Patches PSO*7*387,
 PSJ*5*263, PSS*1*163 and OR*3*346 need to be installed within 2 business 
 days at all sites that have MOCHA v1.0 installed in production.  The
 remaining sites need to install the patches included with this release
 immediately after the installation of the MOCHA v1.0 patches.  These
 patches may be installed in any order after the MOCHA v1.0 patches are
 installed.   (The MOCHA v1.0 installation included patches PSS*1*136,
 PSO*7*251, PSJ*5*181, OR*3*272, PSS*1*117, PSO*7*375)
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch makes a change to the interface when order checks are sent from
 VistA to MOCHA. When Order Checks cannot be performed for any reason, a
 warning message is displayed to the user that order checks did not occur.
 There was an occurrence reported in a test account where Order Checks did
 not occur, but no message was displayed to the user. At the end of all the
 order check processing, this patch will add an additional check to see if
 the flag that indicates the success or failure of the order checks is set.
 If it is not set, it will set the flag that will indicate to the calling
 application that the message indicating order checks were not performed 
 should be displayed to the user.
  
 There was also a problem reported of an error in the Interface Scheduler 
 [PSS INTERFACE SCHEDULER] option. This is the background task that checks 
 on a scheduled interval to see if the connection to the vendor database is
 operational. The error occurred when this task was queued to run from the
 identity of POSTMASTER, because the internal entry number contained a
 decimal, and that number is sent through the interface, which caused the 
 error. For a resolution, this patch will substitute the number 0 whenever
 this number is not a whole number. The same logic will be applied to Job
 Number. This same logic will also be applied to Station Number, after
 stripping off any characters that are not numeric.

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ================= 
  
 Do not install this patch while Outpatient Pharmacy users, Inpatient 
 Medication Users or Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) users are
 on the system, because the code being patched is invoked every time a
 medication order is entered from any of these three applications.
 Additionally, the PSS INTERFACE SCHEDULER background task invokes a
 routine in this patch, so install when that task would not be running.
  
 Installation will take no longer than 5 minutes.
  
    1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
    2. Use FTP to download PSS_1_163.KID file.
  
    3. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
       select the Installation menu.
  
    4. Select the Load a Distribution and enter the directory that you
       FTP'ed the host file to and PSS_1_163.KID.  Example:

    5. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System (KIDS) menu,
       you may select to use the following options (when prompted for
       INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*163):
      a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
         backup any other changes such as Data Dictionaries or templates.
      b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
      c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
         the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
      d. Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
  
   4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package PSS*1.0*163.
