Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI 
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to PSS*1*151 is included in 
 "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation Guide".   
  
 Patch information:
 PSS patches exported as two host files support CPRS v28 functionality.
 PSS_1_142.KID
 PSS_1_151.KID
  
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID includes the required patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3.0*293
 GMRC*3.0*66
 GMRA*4.0*45
  
 OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID includes the CPRS, Pharmacy and Clinical Reminders 
 patches required for CPRS GUI v28.  It includes builds for the following 
 patches: 
 OR*3.0*280
 PSJ*5.0*226
 PXRM*2.0*16
  
 CPRS28_RELATED.KID includes the related patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 GMRC*3.0*64
 GMTS*2.7*90
 OR*3.0*337
  
 Installation of these five host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected because these host files will install the software 
 needed to implement CPRS GUI v28.
  
  
 The patch contains a new routine PSSDSAPA that will perform the following
 function:
  
    The routine returns a default value for the ADDITIVE FREQUENCY field
    (#18) of the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) for a specified entry in the
    PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7).  This field may be set to One
    Bag/Day or, All Bags. All active IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6) entries that
    are matched to the PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7) entry are
    evaluated. For any value other than null to be returned, all values for
    the ADDITIVE FREQUENCY field (#18) in the matched IV ADDITIVES file
    (#52.6) entries must be set to the same value.
  
 This function will be used for continuous IV orders with additives that
 are entered by CPRS. The ability for CPRS to use this call is documented
 in DBIA #5504. The entrypoint to call is $$IV^PSSDSAPA(pointer to the
 PHARMACY ORDERABLE ITEM file (#50.7)).
