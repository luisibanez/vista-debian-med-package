Subject:  SUPRA-THERAPEUTIC DOSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR) #20070434 to prevent
 the inadvertent creation of supra-therapeutic possible dosages for high
 risk medications during the dosage creation segment of Pharmacy Data
 Management (PDM) and National Drug File (NDF) updates.  The Pharmacy Data
 Management V. 1.0 and the National Drug File V. 4.0 were modified
 to satisfy the request. The NDF portion is addressed in patch PSN*4*262.
  
 This patch has the following enhancements:
  
 1. This enhancement utilizes three new fields that were added to the
    VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) as part of patch PSN*4*261. These fields will
    be used during the Match/Rematch process of the Drug Enter/Edit [PSS
    DRUG ENTER/EDIT] and the Enter/Edit Dosages [PSS EDIT DOSAGES] options
    to determine if possible dosages should be auto- created or not. The
    three fields are:
          - CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40)
          - POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41)
          - PACKAGE field (#42)
  
 When CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) is "YES", then the
 existing functionality of auto-creating possible dosages will be retained.
 When this field is "NO", it will be used in combination with the value in
 POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) to determine the auto-creation of
 possible dosages.
  
 The following conditions will apply when CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE
 field (#40) is "NO":
  
    a. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "NO", no possible
       dosages will be auto-created and the following message will be
       displayed:
  
      "Due to National Drug File settings no possible dosages were
       auto-created."
  
    b. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "O", 1x possible dosage
       will be auto-created for the package specified by the new PACKAGE
       field (#42) and the following message will be displayed:
  
       "Due to National Drug File settings only one possible dosage will be
        auto-created.
        If other dosages are needed, create POSSIBLE DOSAGES or LOCAL
        POSSIBLE DOSAGES as appropriate."
  
    c. If POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41) is "B", 1x and 2x possible
       dosages will be auto-created for the package specified by the new
       PACKAGE field (#42).
  
 2. This patch retires the Auto Create Dosages [PSS DOSAGE CONVERSION]
    option. This option is retired because, if it is run inadvertently, it
    will delete all existing "Possible Dosages" and "Local Possible
    Dosages" and will re-set the Possible Dosages back to NDF settings. The
    changes that were entered locally by the site for "Possible Dosages"
    and "Local Possible Dosages" will be lost. Upon patch installation,
    this option will be removed from the Dosages [PSS DOSAGES MANAGEMENT]
    menu.
