Description:
============

 This patch is exported in conjunction with CPRS v28.
  
 CPRS v28 and associated patches will follow a phased implementation.
 Software retrieval of CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID will be coordinated with the
 phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:

 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
  
 This enhancement is an interim resolution approved by the Inpatient
 Medications Workgroup for Patient Safety Issue PSI 08-026, PSPO #852,
 as described in Remedy Ticket HD233682. This patch will provide a default
 medication route for IV fluids ordering dialog in Computerized Patient
 Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0 if all of the orderable items on the order
 share the same default medication route.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Currently, for IV orders, if there is more than one orderable item on the
 order, no default medication route is being presented as a default for the
 medication route selection list in CPRS.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This enhancement for IV orders will denote the default medication route
 in the selection list in CPRS if all of the orderable items on the order
 have the same default medication route defined. If the orderable items on
 the order have different default medication routes, the current 
 functionality will be retained where all medication routes from the 
 orderable items will be displayed to the provider for selection in CPRS 
 and no medication route will be presented as a default.

 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
  
  1.  Download the KIDS file PSS_1_142.KID from the appropriate directory.
  
  2.  Review your mapped set. If the routines are mapped, they should
      be removed from the mapped set at this time.
  
  3.  From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.
  
  4.  From this menu, select the option Load a Distribution.  When prompted
      for a file name, type in the directory where you have stored the host
      file, followed by the file name.
  
  5.  From this menu, you may select to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter PSS*1.0*142.) 
    a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
       backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
    b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
       is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
       DDs, templates, etc.).
    c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
       the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
  
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and at the INSTALL NAME prompt,
      enter PSS*1.0*142.
  
  7. When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//"
     respond NO.
  
  8. When prompted "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols? YES//" respond NO.
  
  9. Installation of this patch should NOT be queued.
  
 10. If any routines were unmapped as part of step 2, they should be
     returned to the mapped set once the installation has run to
     completion.
