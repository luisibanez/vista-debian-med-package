Subject: MOCHA RETRY AFTER ORDER CHECK FAILURE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When calls are made to the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA), a "Ping" type of call is made first to test the communication, 
 and if that is successful, the subsequent order check call is made. If 
 either call fails, the process is aborted, and a message is displayed 
 indicating that order checks cannot be performed.
  
 This patch introduces a "re-try" if either of these calls fail. After a
 three second hang, the call (Ping or order check) will be attempted again.
 If the same call fails a second time, the process will be aborted with the
 message indicating that order checks cannot be performed.
  
 This patch also addresses an issue (in conjunction with patch PSO*7.0*379)
 concerning Orderable Items that are flagged as Supplies. If an order check
 is to be performed on an order that only has an Orderable Item with no
 Dispense Drug, an attempt is made to find the best drug available that is
 matched to the Orderable Item for the order check. Currently, if the 
 Orderable Item is marked as a supply, no order checks are performed. But 
 if the Orderable Item has both Supply and non-Supply Items matched to it, 
 order checks can possibly be performed on one of the non-supply items. 
 This patch makes the change to look for non-Supply Items matched to the 
 supply Orderable Item to perform the order checks on.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
  
 The Environment Check routine PSSEN168 will perform the following:
  
      Check to see if patch PSO*7.0*379 is installed. If not, the 
      PSS*1.0*168 patch install process will be aborted. The reason this
      check is contained in an Environment check routine instead of a
      normal patch requirement is so the CMOP National Host facilities can
      also install this patch. If PSO*7.0*379 is not installed, but the
      location is a CMOP National Host facility, the PSS*1.0*168 install
      will not be aborted.
  
      The Environment check routine PSSEN168 is marked to be deleted upon 
      install, but it will only be deleted if the Kernel parameter XPD 
      NO_EPP_DELETE is not set to 1.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should not be installed when Pharmacy Data Management options
 are being used. And since this patch exports routines that are invoked on 
 every medication order check, we recommend it should be installed during
 Non-Peak hours for all Clinical Applications, and that includes tasked
 jobs from Clinical Applications.
