Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the new Medication 
 Order Check Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  These patches will 
 replace most of the current VistA medication order checking system with 
 version 1.0 of the new Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA) system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) Drug Information 
 Framework (DIF) interfaces and database. The VistA Drug Interaction 
 module will be replaced by the FDB Drug-Drug Interaction Module (DDIM). 
 The VistA Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the FDB Enhanced 
 Therapeutic Classification (ETC) System. In addition, the following three 
 order checks that use VistA data have been added to Inpatient Medications 
 and Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks currently occur in Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS), but will be new to Pharmacy with the 
 installation of these patches:
  
         Aminoglycoside Ordered
         Dangerous Meds for Patients > 64
         Glucophage - Lab Results
   
 A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced 
 called Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only by
 members of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM). It will allow the NDF 
 Support Group to customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
  
 The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
 this release:
         Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
         Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
         Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check 
         display and processing (PSI-07-080)
  
 Please refer to the MOCHA v1.0 Release Notes for additional information.
   
 MOCHA v1.0 consists of two host files: PSS_1_136.zip, 
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID, and two patches PSS*1*117 and PSO*7*375. These
 files and patches contain software that support MOCHA v1.0
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the
 phased implementation release method for MOCHA v1.0.  MOCHA v1.0 will
 follow a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates
 for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx 
  
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team. Installation information
 for MOCHA v1.0 is included in the VistA to MOCHA v1.0 Interface
 Installation Guide and the MOCHA v1.0 Combined Build Installation Guide.
  
 Patch Information:
 PSS_1_136.zip includes the components necessary for the 
 interface that will be used in MOCHA v1.0:  
         PRE_I_3_INTERFACE_BUILD.KID (contains PSS*1*136) 
         PSSPRE_1_0.XML
      
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID includes the following required patches to 
 enable the MOCHA v1.0 functionality:
         PSO*7*251
         PSJ*5*181
         OR*3*272
  
 These patches will be distributed as standalone patches via FORUM and will
 support MOCHA v1.0:
         PSS*1*117
         PSO*7*375
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the 
 phased implementation.  During each implementation phase, the 
 Implementation Team will provide each site the instructions and location 
 to obtain the software.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview:
 -------------------------------
 The Environment Check routine PSS117EN will perform the following tasks:
  
 1) Add the PSS ORDER CHECKS VistA Mail group, if it does not already 
    exist. The patch installer will be prompted to enter a Mail Group
    Organizer. If an Organizer is not entered, or the mail group cannot be
    created, the install will be aborted. If the Mail Group already exists
    upon install, these actions will not occur. The Mail Group should exist
    on the system, since it was originally exported in patch PSS*1.0*147.
  
  2) Add the following three entries to the APSP INTERVENTION TYPE
     (#9009032.3) File, if they don't already exist in the file:
     MAX SINGLE DOSE
     DAILY DOSE RANGE 
     MAX SINGE DOSE & DAILY DOSE RANGE
     If any of the entries cannot be added to the file, the install will be
     aborted.
  
  3) Checks to see if any entries in the MEDICATION ROUTES (#51.2) File
     remain unmapped to an entry in the STANDARD MEDICATION ROUTES (51.23)
     File. It also checks to see if there are any entries in the LOCAL
     POSSIBLE DOSAGE (#50.0904) Subfile of the DRUG (#50) File that do not
     have data populated for either the DOSE UNIT (#4) Field or NUMERIC
     DOSE (#5) Field. If either of these are true, the patch installer will
     be given a prompt to either continue with the install, or abort the 
     install.
  
     It should be noted that not all Medication routes can be mapped at
     this time. For a few medication routes (Intrathoracic,
     Intrafollicular) it was recommended that they be left unmapped.
     Because of this, all sites will see a warning message that not all
     Medication Routes have been mapped during the install and the
     installer will be prompted to continue:
  
     There are still local Medication Routes marked for 'ALL PACKAGES' not
     yet mapped. Any orders containing an unmapped medication route will
     not have dosage checks performed. Please refer to the 'Medication
     Route Mapping Report'option for more details.
  
     If the pharmacy ADPAC has completed the rest of the required mapping, 
     then the installer should continue with the installation.
  
  4) Remove the Drug Interaction Management [PSS DRG INTER MANAGEMENT] Menu
     Option and the Enhanced Order Checks Setup Menu  [PSS ENHANCED ORDER
     CHECKS] Menu option from the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu
     Option.
   
 The Post-Init routine PSS117PO will perform the following tasks:
  
 1) Send a mail message to the patch installer and to the members of the
    PSS ORDER CHECKS Mail Group indicating that the install is complete.
  
 2) Attach the Request Changes to Enhanced Order Check Database [PSS ORDER
    CHECK CHANGES] Option to the Order Check Management [PSS ORDER CHECK
    MANAGEMENT] Menu Option.
  
 3) Attach the Report of Locally Entered Interactions [PSS REPORT LOCAL
    INTERACTIONS] Option to the Order Check Management [PSS ORDER CHECK
    MANAGEMENT] Menu Option.
  
 4) Attach the Order Check Management [PSS ORDER CHECK MANAGEMENT] Menu
    Option to the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu Option.
  
 5) Attach the Schedule/Reschedule Check PEPS Interface [PSS SCHEDULE PEPS 
    INTERFACE CK] Option to the PEPS Services [PSS PEPS SERVICES] Menu
    Option.
  
 6) Re-attach the IV Additive/Solution [PSS ADDITIVE/SOLUTION] Menu Option
    to the Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu Option.
  
 7) Re-attach the Warning Builder [PSS WARNING BUILDER] Option to the
    Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu Option.
  
 8) Re-attach the Warning Mapping [PSS WARNING MAPPING] Option to the
    Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu Option.
  
 9) Re-attach the PEPS Services [PSS PEPS SERVICES] Menu Option to the
    Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] Menu Option.
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 This patch should not be installed when Pharmacy Data Management options
 are being used. Since this patch exports so many Pharmacy Data Management
 components that could be invoked from other Clinical Applications, we
 recommend it should be installed during Non-Peak hours for all Clinical
 Applications, and that includes tasked jobs from Clinical Applications.
  
  
 Install Time - less than 10 minutes
  
 ************ PRE-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS **************
 Because of the rebuilding of the Pharmacy Data Management menu structure 
 as part of this patch, any locally added options under the Pharmacy Data 
 Management [PSS MGR] menu option, or any of it's sub-menus, may no longer
 be attached to these PSS menus after patch install. Please review the
 Pharmacy Data Management [PSS MGR] menu option and it's sub-menus prior to
 install to make note of any locally added options, so they can be
 re-attached after install.
