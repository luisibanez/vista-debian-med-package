Subject: DRUG SYNONYM TRIGGER, ENTER/EDIT DOSAGE AND PSS WARNING BUILDER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the issues reported in:
  
 1) HD0000000111095 - PSS WARNING BUILDER option fails to respond properly
    When using the VistA "Warning Builder" [PSS WARNING BUILDER] option
    and the user enters a ? or ?? for additional help information,
    the program returns very little help information.
  
 2) HD0000000133036 - Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent
    Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent with those on the drug level.
  
 3) HD0000000324175 - 6 Enter/Edit Dosages
    In the "Enter/Edit Dosages" option in Pharmacy Data Management, there
    is a problem with the BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt when editing a
    Possible Dosage. The BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt should only be given
    if the Possible Dosage Package field  is marked for Inpatient ("I"),
    and the Application Packages Use field for the drug contains a "I" or
    "U".  Currently the prompt appears twice if the Possible Dosage Package
    and Drug is marked for Inpatient, (and it should only appear once).
    When the drug is not marked Inpatient, the prompt appears only once
    when it should not appear at all.
  
 4) HD0000000157266 - Synonym DUOU field does not allow for input of decimal
    The input template for DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT (^DD(50,15))
    allows for the input of decimal values (e.g. 2.5).

 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s)
 ============================
 1)HD0000000111095 - PSS WARNING BUILDER option fails to respond properly
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When using the VistA "Warning Builder" [PSS WARNING BUILDER] option there
 are two options that return very little help information when entering
 ? or ??. 
  
 The 1st option is "3. Select by range of drug names".  At the "Enter
 starting drug name:" prompt the ? or ?? only returns
  
 "This response can be free text."
  
 for the help information.
  
 The 2nd option "7. Drugs containing specific new data source warning
 number" at the "Select drugs containing New warning number:" prompt and
 the user enters ? or ?? it returns
  
  "Answer using format # or #N"
  "Example: 15 or 15N"
  
 for the help information.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 To correct this problem, the simple input logic will be replaced with the
 more complex  FileMan routines.
 1. "3. Select by range of drug names" option input:
 The input for the "3. Select by range of drug names" option will be
 modified to use the ^DIC routine which will display the standard lookup
 for the DRUG file.
  
 a. If the user enters ? at the "Enter starting drug name: " prompt,
    they will be prompted to enter a DRUG NUMBER or GENERIC NAME.
  
 ? Example:
 ------------
 Enter starting drug name: ?
 Answer with DRUG NUMBER, or GENERIC NAME, or VA PRODUCT NAME, or
     NATIONAL DRUG CLASS, or NDC, or APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE, or
     ATC MNEMONIC, or DRUG TEXT ENTRY, or SYNONYM
 Do you want the entire 1740-Entry DRUG List?  Y  (Yes)
  
  Choose from:
   1      AZATHIOPRINE 50MG TAB      IM600       02-02-94
   2      BATH PROB. DRUG #3      AA000     N/F
   .
   .
   17     FLUOROURACIL CREAM 1% 30GM       DE600
   18     FLUOROURACIL 2% TOP.SOL.       DE600         DERM CLINIC ONLY
      
   '^' TO STOP:
  
 b. If the user enters ?? at the "Enter starting drug name:" prompt,
    they will see a list of the drugs in the numerical order in which they
    were entered.
  
 ?? Example:
 --------------
 Enter starting drug name: ??
     
   Choose from:
   1     AZATHIOPRINE 50MG TAB      IM600       02-02-94
   2     BATH PROB. DRUG #3      AA000     N/F
   .
   .
   17    FLUOROURACIL CREAM 1% 30GM       DE600
   18    FLUOROURACIL 2% TOP.SOL.       DE600         DERM CLINIC ONLY
      
    '^' TO STOP:
  
 c. If the user enters 1 or more of the beginning letter of the drug,
    they see an alphabetical listing of the drug that begin with the
    letters that were entered.
  
  Partial Drug name entry Example:
  Enter starting drug name: ACET
    1   ACETAMINOPHEN 1000MG TABLET    PH000
    2   ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG C.T.     CN103      ** OK 90 DAY SUPPLY **
    3   ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG TABLET    CN103  INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESTRICTED TO
    4   ACETAMINOPHEN 650MG SUPPOS.   CN103
    5   ACETAMINOPHEN AND CODEINE 30MG   CN101
  Press <RETURN> to see more, '^' to exit this list, OR
  CHOOSE 1-5:
  
 The user will then be required to select which drug item they want to
 start with. This type  lookup will also be used for the Ending Drug Name.
 Once the user has selected their starting and ending drug names, the
 program will check to ensure that the ending drug name falls alphabetically
 after the starting drug name.  If the ending drug name comes alphabetically
 before the starting drug name, the program will return to "Enter starting
 drug name:" prompt.
  
 2. "7. Drugs containing specific new data source warning number"
 The ? & ?? help text will be modified to:
 a. If the user enters ? at the "Select drugs containing New warning number:"
    prompt the help text displayed will be changed to;
       "Answer with WARNING LABEL-ENGLISH NUMBER using the format #N."
       "Where # is the numeric number of the warning label desired."
       "Example:  for the warning label number 15 entry 15N."
  
 b.If the user enters ?? at the "Select drugs containing New warning number:"
   prompt, the program will display the list of choices available to the user
   to choose from.
  
   ?? Example:
   -------------
     Select drugs containing New warning number: ??
  
     Choose from:
     1N
     2N
     .
     .
     20N
     22N
    '^' to STOP:
  
     Choose from:

 2)HD0000000133036 - Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Drug Synonym triggers are inconsistent with those on the drug level.
 The Drug Synonyms PRICE PER ORDER UNIT field 402 & DISPENSE UNITS PER 
 ORDER UNIT field 403 do not have triggers to update the PRICE PER DISPENSE
 UNIT field 404.  Where as their Drug file counter parts PRICE PER ORDER
 UNIT field 13 & DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT filed 15 do have triggers to
 update the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field 16 whenever they are changed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Triggers will be added to the Data Dictionaries for the PRICE PER ORDER
 UNIT field 402 and DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field 403 of the SYNONYM
 sub-file 50.1 of the DRUG file 50 to update the PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT
 field 404 of the SYNONYM sub-file 50.1 of the DRUG file 50.
 These changes will ensure that the drug's PRICE PER DISPENSE UNIT field will
 be properly updated when any edits that are done the PRICE PER ORDER UNIT
 field or the DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT field.
  
 3)HD0000000324175 - 6 Enter/Edit Dosages
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the "Enter/Edit Dosages" option in Pharmacy Data Management, there is a
 problem with the BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt when editing a Possible Dosage.
 The BCMA UNITS PER DOSE prompt should only be given if the Possible Dosage
 Package field  is marked for Inpatient ("I"), and the Application Packages
 Use field for the drug contains a "I" or "U".  Currently the prompt appears
 twice if the Possible Dosage Package and Drug is marked for Inpatient, (and
 it should only appear once). When the drug is not marked for Inpatient, the
 prompt appears only once when it should not appear at all.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The routine that controls the prompts for editing the drug's DISPENSE UNITS
 PER DOSE will be modified to only prompt the user for the BCMA UNITS PER
 DOSE if the Possible Dosage Package field  is marked for Inpatient ("I"),
 and the Application Packages Use field for the drug contains a "I" or "U".
 If the Possible Dosage Package field is ONLY marked Outpatient ("O"), the
 prompt will not be displayed.
  
 4)HD0000000157266 - Synonym DUOU field does not allow for input of decimal
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The input template for DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT (^DD(50,15))
 allows for the input of decimal values (e.g. 2.5).  The input template
 for the DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT (^DD(50.1,403)) of the synonym
 multiple does not.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the input transform for ^DD(50.1,403) to allow decimal values.
