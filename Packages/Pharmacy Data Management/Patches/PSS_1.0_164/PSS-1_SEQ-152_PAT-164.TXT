Description:
============

 ***************************Attention*************************
 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application
 (MOCHA) v1.0 Enhancements 1 group of patches. There are a total of eight
 patches and one .KID (host) file that must be installed as a group. The
 patches must be installed in the following order:
  
 OR*3*352
 PSS*1*164
 PSS*1*169
 PSO*7*390
 PSO*7*417
 PSJ*5*268
 <xxx>_1_0_P23.KID
 PSJ*5*260
 PSJ*5*288
  
 For the".KID" file, value of <xxx> will be determined by the ward 
 automated dispensing equipment in use at your facility. If no 
 ward automated dispensing equipment is in use at your site, this 
 file will not be needed.  For those sites using Pyxis, xxx=PPU, for 
 Omnicell, xxx=OPU and for McKesson sites, xxx=MPU. To obtain this 
 file or if additional information is required regarding this 
 ".KID" file, please contact your site's Informatix contact.
  
  This patch makes three enhancements to Pharmacy Data Management (PDM)
  and re-introduces an option from PSS*1*129 as a "stand alone" option:
  
  The first enhancement adds a new menu option under the menu option
  entitled "PEPS Services" [PSS PEPS SERVICES]. This new option is entitled
  "Print Interface Data File" [PSS VENDOR INTERFACE REPORT]. This report
  prints entries from the VENDOR INTERFACE DATA file (#59.74). The user is
  asked for a date/time range and the report is sorted by the most recent
  downtime first.
  
  The second enhancement is a change to the menu option entitled
  "Check PEPS Services Setup" [PSS CHECK PEPS SERVICES SETUP]. Additional
  functionality is provided to the user with a device prompt to send the
  output to a printer device or they may choose to print to the screen.
  
  The third enhancement deals with the way entries in the DOSE UNITS file
  (#51.24) are displayed. Some of the entries in this file are composed
  of TallMan lettering (mixed case). Under the menu option entitled
  "Request Change to Dose Unit" [PSS DOSE UNIT REQUEST], if a user
  requests a change to an entry that is composed of Tallman lettering,
  previously, these entries did not collate as desired. Any entry
  composed of TallMan lettering is converted to uppercase when doing the
  lookup so that alphabetic sorting is maintained while still preserving
  TallMan lettering. A Post-Install routine PSS164P is included to re-index
  the DOSE UNITS file (#51.24).
  
  The option "Find Unmapped Local Possible Dosages" [PSS LOCAL DOSAGES
  EDIT ALL] is exported and re-introduced as a "stand alone" option. The
  option loops through all Local Possible Dosages, identifies entries
  eligible for dosage checks that do not have data in the new Dose Unit
  and Numeric Dose fields, and prompts for data entry into these fields.
  It was purposely deleted with the install of MOCHA V1.0. It was thought
  that it was no longer needed. It is being exported at the request of
  the sites. It was found that some had not fully mapped their dosages
  completely and have since added new drugs to DRUG file (#50) as well
  as have unmatched some drugs to National Drug File (NDF).
