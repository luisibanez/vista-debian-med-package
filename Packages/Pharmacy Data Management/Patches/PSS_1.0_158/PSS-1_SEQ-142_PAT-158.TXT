Subject: FDA MEDICATION GUIDES - ON-DEMAND DISPLAY (INCREMENT 2)

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains software modifications to the Pharmacy Data Management 
 (PDM) V. 1.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
 project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
 Guide for prescriptions that contain FDA approved information that can help
 patients avoid serious adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
 Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
 when the Agency determines that: 
  
  . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
  . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
    serious side effect with a product, or 
  . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
    to its effectiveness. 
  
 The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
 incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
 features included in this release are:
  
  . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
    the VA network.
  
  . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
    corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
    the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
  
  . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
    automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
    software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
    bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
    identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
    automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
    user via the Internet Explorer browser. 
   
  . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
    GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
    displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
  
  . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
    [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
    for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific 
    prescription.
   
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
 with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*343
    NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) V. 4.0                      PSN*4*263
    PHARMACY DATA MANAGEMENT (PDM) V. 1.0                PSS*1*158
    
 The FDA Medication Guides project is expected to complete in three 
 increments. Among other features, the next Increment will automate the 
 printing of FDA Medication Guides for prescriptions dispensed by the VA
 via Outpatient Pharmacy application when the prescription label is printed.
    
 The following modifications are included in this patch (PSS*1*158):
    
   1. New Data Dictionary field added to PHARMACY SYSTEM (#59.7) file
  
   A new field called FDA MED GUIDE SERVER URL (#100) is being added to the
   PHARMACY SYSTEM (#59.7) file. This field will be used to store the FDA
   Medication Guide Web server URL which will be used in conjunction with
   the FDA MED GUIDE (#100) field in the VA PRODUCT (#50.68) file to compose
   the complete FDA Medication Guide URL for a specific VA Product entry.
   
   2. A post-install routine will run to set this new field with the value
   shown below, which is the current FDA Medication Guides web Server URL:
   
      http://vaww.national.cmop.va.gov/FDAMedGuides/
   
   Note: Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2613 is being modified to
         include this new field in the list of fields that can be read by
         the National Drug File (NDF) application.
