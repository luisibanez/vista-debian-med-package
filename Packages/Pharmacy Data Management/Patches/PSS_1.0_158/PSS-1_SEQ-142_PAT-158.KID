This patch contains software modifications to the Pharmacy Data Management 
"BLD",7496,1,2,0)

"BLD",7496,1,3,0)
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
"BLD",7496,1,4,0)
Guide for prescriptions that contain FDA approved information that can help
"BLD",7496,1,5,0)
patients avoid serious adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
"BLD",7496,1,6,0)
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
"BLD",7496,1,7,0)
when the Agency determines that: 
"BLD",7496,1,8,0)
 
"BLD",7496,1,9,0)
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
"BLD",7496,1,10,0)
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
"BLD",7496,1,11,0)
   serious side effect with a product, or 
"BLD",7496,1,12,0)
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
"BLD",7496,1,13,0)
   to its effectiveness. 
"BLD",7496,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",7496,1,15,0)

   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
"BLD",7496,1,29,0)
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
"BLD",7496,1,30,0)
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
"BLD",7496,1,31,0)
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
