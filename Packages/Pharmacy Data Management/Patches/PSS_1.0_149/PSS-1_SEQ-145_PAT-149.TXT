 Remedy Ticket Overview:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000222760 - Pharmacy standard schedule problem
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The use of the @ in the ADMINISTRATION SCHEDULE file (#51.1) NAME field
    (#.01), with the exception of day-of-week schedules, causes the user
    to be locked into a prescription for a 1 time order (reorder). 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The use of the @ is for day-of-week schedules only.  This patch will
    modify the input transform for the NAME field (#.01) to only allow use 
    of the @ for schedules with a type of day-of-week. 
    
  
    Examples of day-of-week schedules are:
    
    MO-WE-FR@1200  OR SU@1200-2400
  
    Example of invalid schedule:
    Q3D@0700
  
    Note:
    -----
    See the POST-INSTALL steps for how to search the ADMINISTRATION 
    SCHEDULE file (#51.1) NAME field (#.01) for the @ character.
  
  
 2. HD0000000422160 - <UNDEFINED>ENPSJ+6^PSSJSV *X
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option
    and the user enters a schedule with "QD","QOD","HS","TIW", the user
    will encounter an <UNDEFINED> error.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option will be
    modified to prevent the error when editing a schedule containing
    "QD","QOD","HS","TIW".
