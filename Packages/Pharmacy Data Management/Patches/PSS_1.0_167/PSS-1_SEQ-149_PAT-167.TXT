Subject: PDM/PPS-N SECURITY KEY PATCH

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

  
  This patch is an enhancement patch. It will create five (5) new security
  keys. They will be used to authenticate users using Kernel Authentication
  & Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE). Users who will need to access the
  Pharmacy Product System-National (PPS-N) should be assigned these keys
  after installing this patch, as appropriate. Site users may be assigned
  the PSS_PPSN_VIEWER key only. The other four security keys are only to be
  assigned to members of the National NDF Management Group.
  
  PPS-N is a new development effort underway, which is a  re-engineered
  product to eventually replace the National Drug File Management System
  (NDFMS).
  
  No routines are included in this patch.
