Problem:

---------
"BLD",6385,1,14,0)
Patch PSS*1*143 changed the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT]
"BLD",6385,1,15,0)
option to prevent the prompt for Admin Time from displaying when the
"BLD",6385,1,16,0)
schedule's Type is PRN, making it difficult to remove the admin times
"BLD",6385,1,17,0)
from existing PRN schedules. When the schedule type of an existing
"BLD",6385,1,18,0)
schedule is changed from Continuous to PRN, the admin times are removed,
"BLD",6385,1,19,0)
however, when an existing schedule with a schedule type of PRN is edited,
"BLD",6385,1,20,0)
the admin times are not removed.
"BLD",6385,1,21,0)
 
"BLD",6385,1,22,0)
In addition, an inconsistency exists within the same option: at the
"BLD",6385,1,23,0)
initial prompt for Schedule Type, entering or accepting a default of
"BLD",6385,1,24,0)
"PRN", has no affect on the value of admin times.
"BLD",6385,1,25,0)
However, after pressing Enter or Return to exit the Schedule Type
"BLD",6385,1,26,0)
prompt, if an up-arrow, or caret "^", is used to return to the Schedule
"BLD",6385,1,27,0)
Type field, then entering "PRN" or accepting the default of "PRN" the
"BLD",6385,1,28,0)
second time the prompt is displayed does delete the admin times from the
"BLD",6385,1,29,0)
schedule.
"BLD",6385,1,30,0)
 
"BLD",6385,1,31,0)
Solution:
"BLD",6385,1,32,0)
----------
"BLD",6385,1,33,0)
Change the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option to delete
"BLD",6385,1,34,0)
admin times from the schedule anytime "PRN" is entered, or accepted as a
"BLD",6385,1,35,0)
default, at the Schedule Type field. For existing PRN schedules, admin
"BLD",6385,1,36,0)
times may be deleted by re-entering "PRN", or accepting the default value
"BLD",6385,1,37,0)
"PRN", at the prompt for Schedule Type.
"BLD",6385,1,38,0)
 
"BLD",6385,1,39,0)
Change the same option to make the Schedule Type prompt to have the same
"BLD",6385,1,40,0)
effect on the schedule's admin times for the initial and all subsequent
"BLD",6385,1,41,0)
prompts.
