Description:
============

 This patch corrects a defect introduced by patch PSS*1*143 in the 
 Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option. 
  
  
 HD0000000419996 -  Admin times cannot be deleted from PRN schedules 
 via the Schedule Enter/Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option.
  
 Remedy Overview
 ---------------
 HD0000000419996
  
 Problem:
 ---------
 Patch PSS*1*143 changed the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT]
 option to prevent the prompt for Admin Time from displaying when the
 schedule's Type is PRN, making it difficult to remove the admin times
 from existing PRN schedules. When the schedule type of an existing
 schedule is changed from Continuous to PRN, the admin times are removed,
 however, when an existing schedule with a schedule type of PRN is edited,
 the admin times are not removed.
  
 In addition, an inconsistency exists within the same option: at the 
 initial prompt for Schedule Type, entering or accepting a default of 
 "PRN", has no affect on the value of admin times. 
 However, after pressing Enter or Return to exit the Schedule Type 
 prompt, if an up-arrow, or caret "^", is used to return to the Schedule
 Type field, then entering "PRN" or accepting the default of "PRN" the 
 second time the prompt is displayed does delete the admin times from the 
 schedule.
  
 Solution: 
 ----------
 Change the Standard Schedule Edit [PSS SCHEDULE EDIT] option to delete
 admin times from the schedule anytime "PRN" is entered, or accepted as a 
 default, at the Schedule Type field. For existing PRN schedules, admin 
 times may be deleted by re-entering "PRN", or accepting the default value 
 "PRN", at the prompt for Schedule Type. 
  
 Change the same option to make the Schedule Type prompt to have the same 
 effect on the schedule's admin times for the initial and all subsequent 
 prompts.
