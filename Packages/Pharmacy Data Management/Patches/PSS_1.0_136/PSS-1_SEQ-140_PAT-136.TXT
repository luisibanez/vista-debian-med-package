Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the new Medication 
 Order Check Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  These patches will 
 replace most of the current VistA medication order checking system with 
 version 1.0 of the new Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA) system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) Drug Information 
 Framework (DIF) interfaces and database. The VistA Drug Interaction 
 module will be replaced by the FDB Drug-Drug Interaction Module (DDIM). 
 The VistA Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the FDB Enhanced 
 Therapeutic Classification (ETC) System. In addition, the following three 
 order checks that use VistA data have been added to Inpatient Medications 
 and Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks currently occur in Computerized 
 Patient Record System (CPRS), but will be new to Pharmacy with the 
 installation of these patches:
  
         Aminoglycoside Ordered
         Dangerous Meds for Patients > 64
         Glucophage - Lab Results
   
 A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced 
 called Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only 
 by members of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM).  It will allow the NDF 
 Support Group to customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
  
 The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
 this release:
         Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
         Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
         Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check 
         display and processing (PSI_07_080)
  
 Please refer to the MOCHA v1.0 Release Notes for additional information.
   
 MOCHA v1.0 consists of two host files: PSS_1_136.zip, 
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID, and two patches PSS*1*117 and PSO*7*375.  
 These files and patches contain software that support MOCHA v1.0 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for MOCHA v1.0.  To see current 
 status and target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the 
 following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and 
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team.  Installation 
 information for MOCHA v1.0 is included in the VistA to MOCHA v1.0 
 Interface Installation Guide and the MOCHA v1.0 Combined Build 
 Installation Guide.  
  
 Patch Information:
 PSS_1_136.zip includes the components necessary for the interface that
 will be used in MOCHA v1.0:
         PRE_I_3_INTERFACE_BUILD.KID (contains PSS*1*136)
         PSSPRE_1_0.XML
      
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID includes the following required patches to 
 enable the MOCHA v1.0 functionality:
         PSO*7*251
         PSJ*5*181
         OR*3*272
  
 These patches will be distributed as stand alone patches via FORUM and 
 will support MOCHA v1.0:
         PSS*1*117
         PSO*7*375
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the 
 phased implementation.  During each implementation phase, the 
 Implementation Team will provide each site the instructions and location 
 to obtain the software.
  
  
 This patch (PSS*1.0*136) provides the interface that will be used by 
 MOCHA. It provides all the software and tools necessary to
 complete the setup of the interface, which must be done prior to the
 installation of the remaining patches that make up the new MOCHA system.
