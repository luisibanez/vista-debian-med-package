The Clinical Data Repository/Health Data Repository (CHDR) software team would like to bring your attention to an update to the CHDR software 
which is scheduled for 11:59 pm ET Wednesday January 9th. 2013. ANR:
42797

Please read below but this install will not require any action by your VA
site managers. The functionality of the CHDR Admin GUI has not changed in 
anyway. This release has to do with background messaging code change 
requirements.

This message was also sent in Outlook to the following mail groups:
OIT PD PM Sec Init VLER CHDR Expanded; OIT PD Product Support Health PS 
Clinical Team 2; OIT PD Product Support Health PS Healthcare Admin Team 2;  
VHA CBO Program Application Specialists - PAS; VHA HIM; VHA Clinical 
Applications; OIT PD PM MI VLER CHDR Development

There are no site installs associated with this maintenance update to CHDR 
version 2.1.2 (Austin Automation Center)The following is for informational 
purposes only. CHDR works in the background to facilitate the exchange of 
virtual lifetime electronic health records (VLER) between the Health Data 
Repository (HDR) at VA, and the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) at DoD for 
Active Dual Consumers (ADC). Dual consumers are patients eligible to 
receive healthcare under both DoD and VA health plans, and/or patients being treated at both DoD and VA medical facilities. Most patients are marked active by an automated process developed by DoD. At the VA, patients can be marked active manually using VAs CHDR Administration Application Interface accessed via this website: 

https://hdrchdr.aac.va.gov:5024/CHDR/.
 
NOTE:A patient must be setup as ACTIVE before any patient data can be 
exchanged. The VA Ruthless Reduction Task Force (RRTF) directed the HDR/CDS 
to eliminate caching VistA data in HDR and to get data directly from VistA 
sites. The defect repairs in this maintenance release make the current CHDR 
system compliant with the HDR/CDS Release 3.3.No changes were made to the 
CHDR Admin GUI.

FUNTIONALITY PROVIDED by CHDR:
· Supports the DoD patient ADC Automation process.
· Provides bi-directional, real-time, exchange of computable, 
standardized data. The computable data can be passed individually rather 
than in text blocks so the data can be individually sorted and queried. At 
VA the data can be viewed in VistAWeb.
· Provides integrated outpatient medication lists and integrated drug 
allergy for CHDR to perform medication and allergy interaction checks. At 
VA, the alerts appear in CPRS.
· VA receives historical clinical data on separated service members.
The CHDR 2.1.2 Maintenance Release will also coincide with an upgrade from 

HDR/CDS 3.3.

SITE REQUIREMENTS:
There are no site requirements at this time. Sites should already be setup 
to  communicate with the CHDR server and have their security keys assigned, 
as appropriate for each VAMC. Each site should have a selected clinical 
user identified as the Administrative User (admitting clerk or similar) 
who can setup patients as ACTIVE DUAL CONSUMERS.
