  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  DG*5.3*707, DG*5.3*712, DG*5.3*756, and DG*5.3*821 are required builds
  for patch DG*5.3*837.
   
  The messaging enhancements for new fields are being distributed in
  three VistA namespaces.  The patches should be installed in this
  order: DG*5.3*837, RG*1.0*59, and MPIF*1.0*54.  After installing
  DG*5.3*837, it is not necessary to wait for the data conversion
  completion bulletin to move on with installing RG*1.0*59.  It is
  recommended that these three patches be installed within a short
  time window.
   
  Issue #1
  The following Data Dictionary changes have been made to the TREATING
  FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
    
  The *ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#1) field, which was a pointer to the
  VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file will be removed.  That field
  will be replaced by the ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#10) field, a free text
  field, containing identifier information for either the Health Level
  Seven v2.4 or v3.0 standard.
    
  The *SOURCE ID (#20) multiple, containing the *SOURCE ID (#.01) and
  *IDENTIFIER STATUS (#1) fields will be removed.  These fields will be
  replaced by identical fields at the file level: SOURCE ID (#11) and
  IDENTIFIER STATUS (#12).
    
  DDs for the IN-PERSON PROOFED (#.08) field will be replaced by the
  ROI SIGNED INDICATOR (#.08) field.  The field name and description
  has changed, but the data remains the same.  The ROI (Release of
  Information) SIGNED INDICATOR is a flag indicating that the proofing
  process has been finalized with the MyHealtheVet application and
  thus allows the electronic medical record to be viewed using the
  on-line MyHealtheVet web portal.
    
  Cross-references on the obsolete fields will be replaced by new cross-
  references on the new fields.
   
  Due to a processing logic change on the Master Patient Index (MPI), the
  VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file is no longer needed and will be
  deleted at the conclusion of a data conversion routine.  This file was
  distributed by the MPI team via DG*5.3*825 on 1/25/11, has no authorized
  Integration Agreements, and is being deleted with DBA approval.
   
  Issue #2
  A conversion routine will run as part of the post-initialization.  The
  conversion routine will examine each entry in the TREATING FACILITY LIST
  (#391.91) file.  Data from the obsolete *ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#1) field
  will be used to populate the new ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#10) field.  The
  obsolete *SOURCE ID (#20) multiple, will be reviewed.  If there is only
  one entry in the multiple, that data will be moved to the new SOURCE ID
  (#11) and IDENTIFIER STATUS (#12) fields.  If more than one entry exists
  in the multiple, then a new record at the file level will be created for
  each of these.  Data in each of the obsolete fields will be deleted after
  it has been moved to the corresponding new field.
       
  At the conclusion of the conversion routine, the following obsolete fields
  and file will be removed from the system.
  In the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file, remove the following fields:
      *ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#1) field
      *SOURCE ID (#20) multiple
           *SOURCE ID (#.01) field and
           *IDENTIFIER STATUS (#1) field
  The VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file will be removed.
    
  Issue #3
  Changes have been made to the Health Level Seven (HL7) MFN~M05 Treating
  Facility List Update processor code to handle parsing of the MFE segment
  that could be more than 245 characters long.  Assigning Authority and Id
  Type are parsed from the MFE segment of the message for both HL7 2.4 and
  3.0 versions.  Also, the existing deletion logic for removing Treating
  Facility entries in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file while
  processing the MFN~M05 processor has been modified.
    
  We will no longer update the VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file. 
  That data will be stored directly into the new ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#10)
  field in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
    
  Issue #4
  It has been identified that duplicate entries are being added to the
  PATIENT (#2) file, ALIAS (#2.01) multiple where both the ALIAS (#.01)
  field and ALIAS SSN (#1) field match other ALIAS multiple entries.  The
  post-install routine DG837PST will loop through and delete the duplicate
  entries when both fields match exactly.  To avoid future duplicate
  entries, routine VAFCPTED is being updated to look for duplicate entries,
  and if they are found, the duplicates will be removed.  Null SSN values are
  considered unique only to other null SSN values.  This is also being
  tracked in Remedy ticket HD0000000391167.
        
  Issue #5
  This patch adds the TEMPORARY ID NUMBER (#991.08) and FOREIGN ID NUMBER
  (#991.09) fields to the PATIENT (#2) file.  These fields are Department
  of Defense (DoD) identifiers used for individuals who do not have a
  Social Security Number.  This data is used by the Master Veteran Index
  to support the linking of patient records across VA and DoD.  Post-init
  routine DG837PST ensures that auditing is turned on for these fields.
        
  Issue #6
  This patch enhances the HL7 v2.4 PID builder routine to include the
  values of TEMPORARY ID NUMBER (#991.08) and FOREIGN ID NUMBER (#991.09)
  fields from the PATIENT (#2) file.  These values will be placed in PID-3,
  Patient Identifier List, each as one of the repeating fields.  If the
  value is null in the PATIENT (#2) file, then the value sent will be two
  double quote marks ("").
        
  Issue #7
  Modifications have been made to routine VAFCPTED to enhance the VistA
  HL7 v2.4 patient update API to include the TEMPORARY ID NUMBER (#991.08)
  and FOREIGN ID NUMBER (#991.09) field data.
        
  Issue #8
  The TEMPORARY ID NUMBER (#991.08) and FOREIGN ID NUMBER (#991.09) fields
  have been added to the VistA Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION
  TF INQUIRY] option.  The fields are displayed if they are populated for
  the selected patient record.  The fields are also shown on the Display
  Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] option if populated.
        
  Issue #9
  The obsolete CMOR and CMOR History sections of the Patient MPI/PD Data
  Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] option have been removed.  These
  fields were also removed from the Display Remote Patient Data Query
  [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] option.
      
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  - The following new fields have been added to the PATIENT (#2) file.
      (#991.08) TEMPORARY ID NUMBER 
      (#991.09) FOREIGN ID NUMBER
      
  - The following changes have been made to the TREATING FACILITY LIST
    (#391.91) file.
      - The IN-PERSON PROOFED (#.08) field is now the ROI SIGNED 
        INDICATOR (#.08) field.
      - Three new fields have been added.
         (#10) ASSIGNING AUTHORITY
         (#11) SOURCE ID 
         (#12) IDENTIFIER STATUS
      - The following obsolete fields are removed at the conclusion of
        the conversion routine.
         (#1) *ASSIGNING AUTHORITY
         (#20) *SOURCE ID multiple
            (#.01) *SOURCE ID
            (#1) *IDENTIFIER STATUS
  - The VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file is deleted at the
    conclusion of the conversion routine.

  Pre-Install Routine:
  ====================
  Pre-init routine DG837PRE deletes the DD definition for the IN-PERSON
  PROOFED (#.08) field in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
  KIDS brings in the DDs for the new ROI SIGNED INDICATOR (#.08) field.
  Existing data remains for the ROI SIGNED INDICATOR (#.08) field.
  The DG837PRE routine is automatically deleted at the end of the
  installation.
   
  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  Post-init routine DG837PST does a number of things.
  1) Turn AUDITING on for the TEMPORARY ID NUMBER (#991.08) and FOREIGN
     ID NUMBER (#991.09) fields to the PATIENT (#2) file.
  2) Clean up duplicate entries in the ALIAS (#2.01) multiple of the
     PATIENT (#2) file.
     NOTE: Please be aware that for large sites or those with a large
     number of alias entries in the PATIENT (#2) file, this portion of
     the install may take a few minutes to complete.  That is the reason
     we have advised that the patch could take 15 minutes to install.
     The ALIAS clean up will finish before the conversion process (see
     below) is queued to begin.
  3) The conversion routine is queued to run in the background.  It will
     move the values from the existing SOURCE ID (#20) multiple to the new
     fields for all entries in TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
     The routine will also move the data from the old pointer ASSIGNING
     AUTHORITY (#1) field to the new free text ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#10)
     field.  Data in the obsolete fields will be deleted after it has
     been moved.
  4) When the conversion process finishes, the patch installer will be
     notified with an e-mail message.  This message provides the task
     number, begin time, and end time for the process.  In the event that
     you wish to stop the process after it has started, you can use the
     STOP^DG837PST line tag.  The process can be restarted by using the
     STRTAGN^DG837PST line tag.
  5) Delete old fields from the TREATING FACILITY LIST #391.91 file:
        ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#1) field, and
        SOURCE ID (#20) subfile 391.9101, which includes the
           SOURCE ID(#.01) and IDENTIFIER STATUS (#1) fields
     and delete the obsolete VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file.
     
  The time required for the conversion process is site specific,
  dependent upon the size of your TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.
  The following information from our test sites can be used as a guide.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch takes less than 15 minutes to install.  The patch should
  be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.
   
  NOTE: The conversion process which is tasked to run in the
  background at the end of the install may take a number of hours to
  complete and therefore the installation should be scheduled to begin
  during the off hours.  For all facilities, evening hours are
  recommended.  Extremely large sites may prefer to install on a Friday
  or Saturday evening.  This will minimize the amount of new data
  coming into the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file while the
  conversion process is taking place.
   
  NOTE: The conversion process moves the values from the existing
  SOURCE ID (#20) multiple to the new fields for all entries in TREATING
  FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.  If you choose to do so, you can make
  a backup of this file using global save prior to installing the patch.
   
  1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
   
  2.  The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor,
      Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and
      Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
      HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
   
  3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
      Note:  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
      the patch text only.
     
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  5.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:

      (b)  Compare Transport Global to Current System.
      (c)  Verify Checksums in Transport Global.
      (d)  Print Transport Global.
   
  6.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*837.
     
  7.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? YES//',
      respond NO.
   
  8.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
      Protocols? YES//', respond YES.  The following OPTIONS should be
      disabled during the installation.
      Register a Patient              [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      Load/Edit Patient Data          [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
