Description:
============

  Patch DG*5.3*825 contains elements to support and enhance VA IdM
  (Identity Management) service communication with the National Health
  Information Network (NHIN).  The NHIN can be thought of as the 'parent'
  gateway that communicates with the Master Patient Index (MPI) on behalf
  of its National Health Information Exchange (NHIE) 'children'.  The
  NHIN project has systems that interact with the VA NHIN adapter to
  search for patients.  On behalf of these systems, NHIN will communicate
  with the MPI and serve as an interpreter for the NHIE.  Some of NHINS
  facilities include Kaiser Permanente, the Department of Defense,
  MedVirginia, and the Consumer Preference and Policy System (CPP).
   
  Patch DG*5.3*825 will enhance the capability of VA IdM to support the
  HL7v3.0 formatted Fully Qualified IDs.  This effort will align the
  data perspective to support all four elements of the HL7 v2.4 standard
  PID-3 Identifier sequence as well as the larger HL7 v3.0 formatted
  unique Source IDs.
   
  Extensive information for the PID-3 Identifier sequence can be
  found in the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD),
  HL7 Interface Specifications document, available on the VistA
  Documentation Library (VDL).
   
  DG*5.3*479 and DG*5.3*756 are required builds for patch DG*5.3*825.
   
  Issue #1
  When patient data is edited in VistA, an A04 or A08 Health Level Seven
  (HL7) message is generated to the Master Patient Index (MPI).  When
  that record has an entry in the PATIENT MOVEMENT (#405) file and the
  TRANSACTION (#.02) field equals 1 (ADMISSION) the data is passed in
  the PV2-14 field of the PV2 segment.  This data was incorrectly
  transmitted in the wrong piece of the PV2 segment.  Routine VAFCSB has
  been modified to send the data in the 15th piece of the PV2 segment.
   
  Issue #2
  A new file is created by patch DG*5.3*825.  The VAFC ASSIGNING
  AUTHORITY (#391.92) file stores information used to assemble fully
  qualified identifiers used for either the Health Level Seven v2.4 or
  v3.0 standard.  This data will support future initiatives, (i.e.,
  National Health Information Network (NHIN) and non-Patient Identity
  Management).  The VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file is exported
  with five entries and new data will be added as needed for HL7 messaging.
   
  The length of the SOURCE ID (#.01) field in the SOURCE ID (#20) multiple
  of the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file has been changed from 40
  to 150 characters.  This will accommodate identifiers for National
  Health Information Network (NHIN) facilities.
   
  Two new fields have also been added.  SOURCE ID TYPE (#.09) defines the
  data source and comes from the HL7 Table 0203, Identifier Type.  The
  ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#1) field is a pointer to the VAFC ASSIGNING
  AUTHORITY (#391.92) file.  It identifies the entity that established
  the identification number for the patient.  Cross-references have also
  been added for these new fields.
   
  Issue #3
  Routine VAFCAAUT contains two new Application Programmer Interfaces
  (APIs).  These APIs will be used for the upcoming NATIONAL HEALTH
  INFORMATION EXCHANGE project.
   
  The first API will retrieve data from the VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY
  (#391.92) file.  When either the HL7V2_4 or HL7V3_0 value is passed in,
  the Internal Entry Number (IEN) for that entry in the file is returned.
   
  The second API will create a new entry in the VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY
  (#391.92) file.  The data fields that make up the new entry, most
  likely the HL7V3_0 (#.03) and DEFAULT SOURCE ID TYPE (#.04) fields,
  are passed into the API.  If the entry is successfully created, the API
  returns the IEN.  If the entry cannot be created, an error message
  is returned.
   
  Issue #4
  DG Field Monitor [DG FIELD MONITOR] is a PROTOCOL (#101) that observes
  the editing of fields during the Register a Patient [DG REGISTER
  PATIENT] option.  Under specific conditions, an update could be
  unsuccessful in creating an entry in the ADT/HL7 PIVOT (#391.71) file,
  and thus fail to broadcast an update message to the MPI.
   
  This scenario occurs when a field that uses the DG Field Monitor
  PROTOCOL is edited via the Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
  option.  No other fields are edited and the user exits without
  completing the registration process.  Under these conditions, an entry
  is not created in the ADT/HL7 PIVOT (#391.71) file.  Routine DGFCPROT
  has been changed to correct this.
   
  Issue #5
  When a new entry is added to the MPI ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#985.55) file
  on the MPI, the VAFC AA UPDATE REMOTE PROCEDURE is called.  The RPC
  triggers an update message to those Treating Facilities where the
  patient's Integration Control Number (ICN) is known and creates an
  identical entry in the VistA VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file.
  The VAFCRPC routine is called to make this update.
     
  Data Dictionary Changes:
  ========================
  - The VAFC ASSIGNING AUTHORITY (#391.92) file is a new file that
    contains the following fields.
      (#.01) IDENTIFIER
      (#.02) HL7V2_4
      (#.03) HL7V3_0
      (#.04) DEFAULT SOURCE ID TYPE
  The file is exported with data and will receive updates from the MPI.
   
  - The following changes have been made to the TREATING FACILITY LIST
    (#391.91) file.
      - The length of the SOURCE ID (#.01) field in the SOURCE ID (#20)
        multiple has been expanded.
      - Two new fields have been added.
           (#.09) SOURCE ID TYPE
           (#1) ASSIGNING AUTHORITY
     
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patch DG*5.3*825.
  Facilities should download the revised documentation listed as
  follows:
  
      Technical Manual                    DG5_3_P825RG_TM.PDF
      User Manual                         DG5_3_P825RG_UM.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.MED.VA.GOV
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
  
  OI Field Office         FTP Address                  Directory

  Note:  These files must be transferred in binary or IMAGE,
         not ASCII, mode.
   
  The documents can also be downloaded from the VistA Documentation

  PLEASE NOTE:
  ============
  Routine VAFCSB, distributed in this patch, references routines
  LRPXAPI, PSO52API, and RAO7UTL1.  In the event that DG*5.3*825
  is installed in an account where those routines are not present,
  XINDEX may display either of these messages:
  "Reference to routine (one of the above). That isn't in this UCI."
  "Call to this MISSING LABEL (one of the above)"
    
  VAFCSB contains conditional $$PATCH^XPDUTL checks for the existence
  of the routine and quits if it is not there.  So, the code will work
  with or without the routine being present.
