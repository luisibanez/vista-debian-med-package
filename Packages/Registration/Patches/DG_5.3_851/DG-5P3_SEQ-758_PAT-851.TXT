============

  *****************************************************************************
  Note:  This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System
         Re-design (ESR) Permanent Address Verification project.  DG*5.3*851
         is being released along with IVM*2*152 (Income Verification Match)
         in host file: DG_53_P851.KID.
   
         It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the
  Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
  Eligibility (Vista REE) software to support the requirements of the
  Permanent Address Verification project.
   
  This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
  1.  Add ZIP Code Linking to the Temporary and Confidential Addresses
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  The addition of ZIP Code Linking to the Temporary and Confidential
  Addresses allows for the automatic population of the city, the state
  and the county based on the entry of a ZIP Code.  This new functionality
  follows the current functionality of the Permanent Address.
   
  2.  Add the display of the PERMANENT ADDRESS LAST CHANGED on Screen 1
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  Screen 1 of the Preregister a Patient option [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
  will now contain the date last changed for the address.
   
  3.  Add a separate home phone number change date/time stamp.
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  - A change is made to the PHONE NUMBER [RESIDENCE] (#.131) field which
    adds a trigger cross-reference.  This cross reference will update the
    RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE DT/TM (#.1321) field with the current date
    and time stamp each time this field is changed.
   
  - A new field, RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE DT/TM (#.1321) has been added.
    This field will contain the date and time of the last Residence phone
    number update.  This new field is triggered by the PHONE NUMBER
    [RESIDENCE] field of the PATIENT File.  This cross-reference will
    update the RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE (#.1322) with the source
    of the last Residence phone number change.  This field is uneditable.
   
  - A new field, RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE (#.1322) has been added.
    This field will hold the source of the last Residence phone number
    change.  This new field is triggered by the RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE
    DT/TM field of the PATIENT File.  This cross-reference will update
    the RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SITE (#.1323) with the site that last
    changed this patient's Residence phone number.  If the lookup for
    the site fails, a message will appear on the Registration screen
    "Please review the saved changes!!  The previous error occurred
    when performing an action specified in a cross reference", and no
    site will be triggered to the RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SITE (#.1323)
    field.  This field is uneditable.
   
  - A new field, RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SITE (#.1323) has been added.
    This field will hold the site that last changed this patient's
    Residence phone number.  This field is only populated when the
    Residence Number Change Source is listed as VAMC.  This new field
    is triggered by the RESIDENCE NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field of the
    PATIENT File.  This field is uneditable.
   
  4.  Fix defect that updated the Address Change Date/Time unnecessarily
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Modifications were made to VistA address verification/edit options to fix
  a defect that unnecessarily triggered the sharing of data between VistA 
  and ESR systems when simply confirming a Veteran's address data.  The 
  Address Change Date/Time stamp will only be updated and a message to ESR 
  triggered when an actual change is made to the permanent address.  This 
  defect affected the following Registration options:
   
        Register a Patient               [DG REGISTER A PATIENT]
        Load Edit Patient Data           [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
        Preregister a Patient            [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
        Patient Address Update           [DG ADDRESS UPDATE]
   
  For the first three options, the permanent address will now be displayed 
  before the user is prompted to edit the address.
