Subject: VIC 4.0 AND DOD CAC MPI INTEGRATION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides support for the new VIC 4.0 card and DoD's CAC card.  
 The current VIC (Veteran Identification Card) being issued to patients is 
 being replaced with a new VIC 4.0 card.
  
 The VIC card provides a mechanism either via Barcode Scan or Magnetic 
 Strip to look up a patient in various VistA roll and scroll options.  The 
 contents of both the Barcode and Magnetic Stripe are being updated with 
 the new VIC 4.0 card being issued to patients.
  
 Support for scanning Department of Defense's Common Access Card (CAC) 
 barcode and patient lookup based on the 10 digit EDIPI is included in an 
 effort to provide joint interoperability.
  
 DG*5.3*572, DG*5.3*658, and DG*5.3*769 are required builds for 
 patch DG*5.3*857.
  
 Issue #1
 The main patient lookup routine (DPTLK) currently only supports the legacy
 VIC card for patient lookup.  The routine is being enhanced to also
 support patient lookup based on information contained in the new VIC 4.0
 card and the DoD CAC card.  The new VIC 4.0 card will contain the card
 number in both the Barcode and Magnetic Strip.  The DoD CAC card barcode
 contains the DoD Electronic Data Interchange Person Identifier (EDIPI).  
 Both the card number (VIC 4.0) and the EDIPI will be stored at all sites
 of record in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file.  If the card being
 swiped or scanned is a new VIC 4.0 card or DoD CAC card, the patient
 lookup process will look for a treating facility with the card number or
 EDIPI as the facility unique identifier to find the appropriate patient
 record.
  
 Issue #2
 Currently if the user swiping a VIC card is utilizing a registration 
 option and the patient is not known to the local VA facility there is 
 sufficient detailed information contained in the Magnetic Strip to start 
 the creation of a patient record in the PATIENT (#2) file.  However from a
 confidentiality standpoint that information will not be stored on the new
 VIC 4.0 card.  If a new VIC 4.0 card is being scanned or swiped, the user
 is in a patient registration option and the patient is not known to the
 local VA facility, a query to the MVI will be sent.  This query, if the
 MPIF*1*56 patch is installed, will look-up the needed patient information
 to initiate the registration process at the local VA facility.
  
 Issue #3
 Currently there is no mechanism to add a patient based on a DoD CAC 
 card.  In order to provide joint interoperability with the install of this
 patch if a DoD CAC card is being scanned, the user is in a patient 
 registration option and the patient is not known to the local VA facility,
 a query to the MVI will be sent.  This query, if the MPIF*1*56 patch is
 installed, will look-up the needed patient information to initiate the
 registration process at the local VA facility.
  
 Issue #4
 There are other packages, both local to the VistA M database and other 
 rich clients, including kiosk devices that lookup patients based on the 
 legacy VIC card.  To assist lookup of patients with the VIC 4.0 card or a 
 DoD CAC card a new Supported API (RPCVIC^DPTLK) and Remote Procedure (DG 
 VIC PATIENT LOOKUP) are being added to the REGISTRATION package.  If the 
 patient is known locally to the VistA system the patient's DFN will be 
 returned regardless of which version of the card is being swiped or 
 scanned or if a DoD CAC card is being scanned.
  
 Issue #5
 Prior to this patch there was no way to lookup a patient using their 10 
 digit EDIPI number.  With the install of this patch standard VistA 
 patient selection prompts will now support input of the patient's EDIPI 
 number at 'Select PATIENT:' prompts.

 ==========================
 This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install.  This patch may be 
 installed with users on the system, however because the patient lookup 
 routines are impacted, we suggest it be installed after business hours.
