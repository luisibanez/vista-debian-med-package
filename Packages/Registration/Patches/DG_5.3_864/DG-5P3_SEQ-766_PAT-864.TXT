Description:
============

 This patch addresses the Under Secretary of Health (USH) legal solution.
 The legal solution impacts the High Risk Mental Health Patient - National
 Reminder and Flag (HRMHP) project. A new national category 1 patient
 record flag will provide a tool to inform all Veteran Administration (VA)
 caregivers of special guidelines that must be followed when documenting 
 notes or dealing with the patient. This flag will require special 
 permissions in order to be assigned to a patient and once assigned it 
 cannot be modified or inactivated other than allowing the reassignment of 
 the owning facility. Patch TIU*1*275 creates one new Title into the TIU
 DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (8925.1): PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I -
 URGENT    ADDRESS AS FEMALE. The new URGENT    ADDRESS AS FEMALE PRF must
 only be used with the guidance from the Office of Under Secretary of
 Health on a patient-by-patient basis. It may not be used for any other
 purpose or patient. The ability to assign the new URGENT    ADDRESS
 AS FEMALE PRF will be limited to one identified IRM staff member with
 programmer access, or an identified clinician with temporary programmer
 access assigned by IRM staff at one pre-determined site. The identified
 person with programmer access at the pre-determined site will assign the
 URGENT    ADDRESS AS FEMALE PRF to a pre-determined patient. The text used
 during the assignment will be based on very specific pre-defined text
 provided by the Office of the Under Secretary of Health. Once the patient
 is assigned the URGENT    ADDRESS AS FEMALE PRF and the flag is activated,
 the PRF cannot be inactivated for the patient.
  
 The patch also includes a change to the option Load/Edit Patient Data [DG 
 LOAD PATIENT DATA] to ensure Patient Record Flags are updated when 
 patients register at new facilities.
  
 ************************  A T T E N T I O N  ****************************
  
 XT*7.3*110 - XINDEX update for new SAC, released October 22, 2008, made 
 changes to the routine XINDEX to bring it into compliance with the latest 
 revision of the SAC standards.  The latest revision of the standard can 
 be found at the following URL:
  
 http://vaww.oed.portal.domain.ext/communities/app_dev/sac/default.aspx
  
 DG*5.3*624, 1010 EZ PHASE 3 ENHANCEMENTS, was released to the field 
 August 12, 2005 prior to the implementation of XT*7.3*110. The 
 Development/SQA Team of patch DG*5.3*864, USH LEGAL SOLUTION, identified 
 an issue where the revised version of XINDEX is reporting a violation of 
 the current SAC standard.  The USH LEGAL SOLUTION project did not create 
 or modify the locks where the violations are reported.   A waiver was 
 sought from the SAC committee. The SAC committee recognized:  (1) the 
 issue with the locks was not detected due to circumstances beyond the 
 control of the USH LEGAL SOLUTION project team, and (2) the code has been 
 in production for several years prior to the Standard being updated.  The 
 decision to release rather than to remediate was an approved Management 
 Decision supported by the SAC committee.  A request for remediation of 
 the SAC violation was logged via Remedy Ticket #INC000000899851.
