   Remedy Overview:
   ================
   1) INC0000000770188    Pseudo SSN Calculator allows duplicates
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Current system allows for duplicate Pseudo SSN numbers. This is causing
    issues for the New Born Project, if multiples are born, and allowing for 
    issues within the billing system.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The Pseudo SSN number is based on the birth date, first initial of last
    name and first initial of first name.  Modified routine DGRPDD1 to 
    check for duplicate Pseudo SSN numbers and if one is found, increase  
    the pseudo number by one.
