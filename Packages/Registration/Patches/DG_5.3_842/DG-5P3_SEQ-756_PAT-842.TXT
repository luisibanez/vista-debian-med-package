  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the Enrollment
  System Redesign (ESR) and Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
  Architecture Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility (Vista REE) software to
  support the requirements of the Pension Data Sharing project.
   
  This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
  1.  VA Pension Award Effective Date, Termination Date and Reasons
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Pension Award Effective Date, Termination Date and Reasons have been added
  as new fields on the VistA Registration Screen.  An extension of Screen <7>
  has been added for editing and display of the VA Pension data.   The Pension
  Termination Date and Termination Reasons are presented as display only
  fields.  A single Pension Award Reason is permitted, and up to four Pension
  Termination Reasons can be displayed.  The Z11 receivers and the Z07 senders
  were modified to include the new Pension fields in the ZE2 segment.
   
  2.  Z11 Upload Rules
  --------------------
  The following upload rules apply to the VA Pension data:
  a) The Pension Award Effective Date, Pension Award Reason, Pension
  Termination Date, and Pension Termination Reason(s) shall always be loaded
  to VistA unless the following condition is true:  Pension Award Reason on
  VistA = 'Original Award', and the Pension Award Effective Date on VistA is
  equal to or is earlier than the Pension Award Effective Date on the
  incoming message, and the Pension Termination Date on the incoming message
  has no value.
  b) Once an incoming message is received with any Pension Data, VistA shall
  lock the Pension Indicator field from editing by a VistA user.
  c) If the incoming message contains a Pension Award Reason that is equal
  to 'Original Award,' and the Pension Award Reason and Pension Award
  Effective Date are uploaded, VistA shall lock the Pension Award Reason and
  Pension Award Effective Date fields from editing by a VistA user.
  d) If the incoming message contains a Pension Termination Reason that does
  not have a null value and the Pension Termination Date and Pension
  Termination Reason are uploaded, VistA shall lock all Pension data fields
  from editing by a VistA user.  
   
  3.  Pension Award Effective Date
  --------------------------------
  The following rules apply to the Pension Award Effective Date:
  a) Must be a precise date.
  b) Must be greater than the Veteran's Date of Birth + 16 years.
  c) Is not a required field.
  d) A change made to the Pension Award Effective Date shall trigger the
  sending of a Z07 message.
   
  4.  Pension Award Reason
  ------------------------
  The Pension Award Reason shall be editable if it has not been locked from
  editing by the Z11 upload rules listed above, and the Pension Award
  Reason is not equal to 'Original Award', and the Pension Termination Date
  is null.  The Pension Award Reason is not a required field.
   
  5.  Class II Dental Indicator
  -----------------------------
  Class II Dental Indicator and Class II Dental Application Due Before
  Date have been added as new 'display only' fields on the VistA
  Registration Screen <6>.
   
  6.  Help Text Changes
  -----------------------------
  Medal of Honor and Class II Dental Indicator were added to the VistA
  Registration Screen <6> help text.

  Documentation Retrieval Instructions:
  =====================================
  Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this 
  patch is available.

  This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
  also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
   
   Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
   Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
   Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
   
  The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
  The following files should be downloaded in the binary FTP mode.

  Patch Installation:
  ===================
   
  Installation Instructions:
  --------------------------
   
  This patch may be run with users on the system, however because the
  Registration options need to be placed out of order, we suggest it
  be installed after business hours.
   
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
   
  The following options should be disabled during installation:
   
          Register a Patient                   [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
          Load/Edit Patient Data               [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
