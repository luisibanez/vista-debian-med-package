  ===============
  HD0000000487501 - Treating Specialty Table update needed.
   
  Problem:
  ========
  Changes are needed for the SPECIALTY (#42.4) file due to a coming

  Discharge Criteria for VA Nursing Home Care Units".

  This patch will change the names of four treating specialty codes
  and inactivate one treating specialty code as defined below:
  
  Name Changes for the following four codes:
  =========================================
    Treating       Treating                       NEW NAME
    Specialty      Specialty   
    Code           Name 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
     67       NH SHORT STAY MAINTENANCE       NH SHORT-STAY CONTINUING CARE
     68       NH SHORT STAY PSYCHIATRIC CARE  NH SHORT-STAY MH RECOVERY
     44       NH LONG STAY MAINTENANCE CARE   NH LONG-STAY CONTINUING CARE
     45       NH LONG STAY PSYCHIATRIC CARE   NH LONG-STAY MH RECOVERY 
  
   These changes will be effective upon install of the patch.  The names
   will also be changed in the FACILITY TREATING SPECIALTY (#45.7) file.  
  
   
  Inactivating one code:
  =====================
    Treating              Treating                     INACTIVE DATE
    Specialty             Specialty   
    Code                  Name 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
     43                  NH LONG STAY SKILLED NURSING    10/1/11
   
  The above code will become inactive on 10/1/11 and per email sent on 
  6/8/11 announcing the directive change, sites should have followed 
  the instructions for the inactivation as defined by the 
  VA CLC Chief before that date. 
  
  Per email instructions:
   
  Required actions to prepare for the inactivation of TS 43:
  
  1. Between now and the effective date, as residents who are assigned
     to treating specialty 43 are reviewed by the interdisciplinary team
     for care planning, the team should:
     Review the resident's reason for admission and goals for care.
     Assign that resident to one of the following long stay treating 
     specialty codes based on that review and discussion:
  
         TS 42 - Dementia care (NH LONG STAY DEMENTIA CARE)
         TS 44 - Maintenance care (NH LONG-STAY CONTINUING CARE)
         TS 45 - Psychiatric care or chronically mentally ill care
                (NH LONG-STAY MH RECOVERY)
         TS 46 - Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders
                (NH LONG STAY SPINAL CORD INJ)
  
  2. Do not assign any new admissions to treating specialty code
     43 effective immediately.
  
  3. By Sept 30, 2011 there will be no residents assigned treating
     specialty code 43 -  Long stay skilled nursing care.
  
  
                           
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, HOWEVER because
  the Registration options need to be placed out of order, we
  suggest it be installed after business hours.
   
  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.
   
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
       NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
              global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
              you will need to repeat this step.

   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*844):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*844.
