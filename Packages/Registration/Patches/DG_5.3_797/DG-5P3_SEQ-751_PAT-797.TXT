Subject: MILITARY SERVICE DATA SHARING (MSDS) PROJECT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements to the Veterans Health Information Systems and
 Technology Architecture (VistA) system to support technology and business
 changes that are occurring with the implementation of the Enrollment
 System Redesign (ESR) Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) project.
  
 The MSDS project will introduce an MSDS Broker that will be activated in 
 ESR. The Broker will construct a definitive military service data set 
 including data received from the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), the
 Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS) and VistA.
 Once the MSDS Broker is activated, ESR becomes the authoritative source
 for Military Service Episode data. The verified MSE data will be shared 
 via an Eligibility/Enrollment transmission (ORF/ORU~Z11) from ESR with all
 treating facilities of record for the veteran. The ESR-verified Military
 Service Episode data cannot be edited by VistA except to add new episodes.
 An unlimited number of military service episodes per veteran will now be
 supported.
  
 This patch is being released along with patches EAS*1.0*92, IVM*2.0*141,
 DVB*4.0*62, and PXRM*2.0*21 in host file DG_53_P797.KID.
     
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
   
  
 1.  Receive Military Service Episodes from ESR
 ----------------------------------------------
 ESR-verified Military Service Episode (MSE) data will now be sent to VistA
 in the Z11 HL7 message.  The Z11 receivers were modified to upload MSEs
 from the ZMH segment.  The routines associated with the Z11 upload 
 changes, modified by this patch are DGENUPL1, DGENUPL3, & DGENUPL7.
  
 2.  Support storage of unlimited Military Service Episodes
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 The MSDS project increases the number of MSEs from three to an unlimited 
 number. Modifications were made to the data dictionary of the PATIENT file
 (#2). A new MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#2.3216) was added and will
 support the storage of an unlimited number of MSEs for each veteran.
  
 3.  Enhance Registration to support unlimited MSEs
 --------------------------------------------------
 Military Service Episodes were displayed and edited on the Military 
 Service Data, Screen 6 of the Registration options.  There was a limit of 
 three MSEs.  To support unlimited MSEs, Screen 6 will now just display the
 last three MSEs.  If there are more than three, the message <more 
 episodes> will display under the third.  A new Screen 6.1 was added that 
 will display all the MSEs and allow the user to add new MSEs, or edit MSEs
 that have not been verified by ESR.
  
 4.  Lock all Military Service Episodes sent from ESR
 ----------------------------------------------------
 ESR is the authoritative source for Military Service data.  The 
 ESR-verified MSEs sent to VistA in the Z11 cannot be edited or deleted by 
 VistA users.  MSEs received from ESR are identified by <> on Screen 6.1 
 and cannot be selected to edit or delete. MSEs entered by the VistA site 
 are identified by [] on Screen 6.1 and can be edited or deleted.  
  
 5.  Store old Military Service Episodes
 ---------------------------------------
 MSEs already on file for a veteran when the new MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE 
 sub-file (#2.3216) is added, will remain in the Patient record in the old 
 locations (i.e. the sets of fields in the PATIENT file (#2) that store the
 the LAST, NTL and NNTL service episodes) for historical purposes.  A new
 Screen 6.2 was added to display these old MSEs by selecting the View 
 History action on Screen 6.1. When a patient record is accessed via the
 Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] or Register a Patient [DG
 REGISTER PATIENT] option(s) for the first time AFTER this patch is
 installed, the data stored in the 'old' locations will be copied into the
 new MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#2.3216).  This action is
 transparent to the end user.
  
 6.  Support transmission of unlimited Military Service Episodes
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 The Z07 HL7 message builder will be modified to support the transmission 
 of unlimited MSEs to ESR. The most recent three MSEs will still be sent in
 the ZMH segment with the Military History Type codes SL (most recent), SNL
 (next most recent) and SNNL (next next most recent).  A new Military 
 History Type code, MSD, will be added to send all additional MSEs in the 
 ZMH segment.  The codes are not stored but are calculated during the 
 process to build the full data transmission to HEC (ORF/ORU~Z07).  The 
 calculation occurs in the routine VAFHLZMH.
  
 7.  Retrieve unlimited Military Service Episodes in ROM
 -------------------------------------------------------
 The Register Once Message (ROM) query will be modified to support the 
 transmission and retrieval of unlimited MSEs from the last site treated. 
 The following data elements have been added to the DG REGISTER ONCE FIELD 
 DEFINITION (#391.23) file.
  
       File      Field     Name
       -------   ------    ---------
       2.3216    .01       MSDS SERVICE ENTRY DATE
       2.3216    .02       MSDS SERVICE SEPARATION DATE
       2.3216    .03       MSDS SERVICE BRANCH
       2.3216    .04       MSDS SERVICE COMPONENT
       2.3216    .05       MSDS SERVICE NUMBER
       2.3216    .06       MSDS SERVICE DISCHARGE
       2.3216    .07       MSDS DATA LOCKED
  
 8.  Modify Registration consistency checks
 ------------------------------------------
 Registration consistency checks that pertain to military service data 
 will be modified to check the MSEs in the new sub-file location.  The 
 consistency checks will only be done on MSEs that have not yet been 
 received from ESR as verified MSEs.  The following consistency checks 
 were modified:
  
    67           NO CV, CHECK SERVICE SEP DATE
    72           MSE DATA MISSING/INCOMPLETE 
    73           MSE DATES INCONSISTENT 
    79           MSE DATES OVERLAP 
    81           COMBAT DT NOT WITHIN MSE
    83           BOS REQUIRES DATE W/IN WWII 
    84           FILIPINO VET, PROOF MISSING 
    85           FILIPINO VET SHOULD BE VET='Y' 
  
 9.  Modify Military Service data edit checks
 --------------------------------------------
 Data edit checks performed at the time of user data entry were modified 
 to use the new military service data fields.  The data checks that are 
 being performed are:
  
 a. Check for valid dates.
 b. Check for service separation date not earlier than service entry date.
 c. Check for overlapping MSEs.
 d. Check for WWII MSE dates for certain service branches.
 e. Filipino Vet proof requires Filipino Vet service branch.
 f. Veteran age check.
 g. Check for appropriate service components with certain service branches.
 h. No editing allowed if data was verified by the Health Eligibility 
    Center (HEC).
  
 10.  Combat Vet End Date calculation
 ------------------------------------
 The Combat Vet End Date calculation was modified to use the new MSE 
 fields.
  
 11.  Add two new Types of Discharge
 -----------------------------------
 Two new discharge types were added to the TYPE OF DISCHARGE file (#25) to 
 be consistent with the discharge types sent to ESR from VADIR/BIRLS.  The 
 new types are:
  
     8  DISHONORABLE-VA
     9  HONORABLE-VA
  
 Dishonorable for VA purposes means that for the VBA, there is another 
 reason or circumstance that the VBA has determined that makes the Veteran 
 "Dishonorable" for VA purposes.  The Veteran is not eligible for 
 enrollment in the VA Health Care Program.  If SC conditions exist, they 
 may be treated for the SC conditions only.
  
 Honorable for VA purposes means that for the VBA, even though their DD-214
 says "General" or "Other Than Honorable", there is another reason or
 circumstance that the VBA has determined that makes the Veteran 
 "Honorable" for VA purposes.
  
 12.  Display of Military Service Data modified in MPI inquiry options
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 The display of Military Service Data for Master Patient Index (MPI)
 Inquiry options was modified to get the MSEs from the new MILITARY 
 SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#2.3216).  The modified display is used by the 
 Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] and Display Remote 
 Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] options.
