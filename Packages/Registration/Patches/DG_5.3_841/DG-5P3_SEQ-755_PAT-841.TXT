Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 Note:  This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System
        Re-design (ESR) 3.6 Public Law 111-163 project.  DG*5.3*841 is 
        being released along with IB*2*454 (Integrated Billing) in host
        file DG_53_P841.KID.
   
        It is important that these patches be installed no later than the
        compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
 **************************************************************************
  
 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
 Eligibility (Vista REE) software to support the requirements of Public Law
 111-163. On May 5, 2010, the President signed into law, Public Law (PL)
 111-163. the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of
 2010.  This law provides assistance to caregivers of Veterans and improves
 the provision of health care services to Veterans.  Section 511 prohibits
 collection of copayments from Veterans who are Catastrophically Disabled.
 Section 512 provides for a higher priority status for certain Veterans who
 are medal of honor recipients.  These changes were effective on the date
 of passage, May 5, 2010.  These patches are being issued in support of
 some of these provisions.
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as described below:
  
 1.  Receive Medal of Honor indicator from ESR
 ----------------------------------------------
 The Medal of Honor (MOH) indicator will now be sent to VistA from ESR in 
 the Z11 HL7 message.  The Z11 receivers were modified to upload the MOH
 indicator from the ZMH segment.
  
 2.  Assign Medal of Honor recipients to Priority Group 3
 --------------------------------------------------------
 Modifications were made to the Priority Group algorithm to assign a MOH 
 recipient to Priority Group 3, unless other eligibility factors exist 
 that would place the Veteran in a higher group.
  
 3.  Display the new Medal of Honor indicator
 --------------------------------------------
 The new Medal of Honor indicator will be displayed on Registration and 
 Enrollment screens, but only if the value of the indicator is "YES".  The 
 MOH indicator was added to the Military Service Data, Screen 6 of the 
 Registration options.  It is a display-only field and cannot be modified 
 by the user.  The MOH indicator was also added to the Priority Factors 
 screen of the Patient Enrollment option.

 the files from download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from
 the first available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software
 directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
   
  
 The documentation will be in the form of Adobe Acrobat files.
   
 Documentation can also be found on the System Design and Development Web 
 page at:  http://www.va.gov/vdl/
