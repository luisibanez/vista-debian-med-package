 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. INC0000000351698 - Medicaid inconsistency isn't working
   
 Problem:
 --------   
  
    The Consistency Checker does not validate all designated fields
    when patient information is logged into the LOAD/EDIT PATIENT DATA  
    [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA].
      
   
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
  
    Routine ^DGRPC1 will be modified to allow all designated fields 
    to be processed correctly.
   
     
 2. INC0000000416259 - Pt. SSN changed but still shows up in anxillary 
                       software with old name
    
 Problem: 
 --------
  
    When the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER field (#.09) of PATIENT 
    file (#2) is updated, the PRIMARY LONG ID field (#.363) and 
    the PRIMARY SHORT ID field (#.364) of PATIENT file (#2) are 
    not updating accordingly.
  
     
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
    The resolution has two parts.  The first part will require the data
    dictionary attributes for the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8) to be modified
    to make the ID FORMAT field (#9) a required field. This field will now
    have the following as help text:
    
           Select the ID format to be used.
    
    A pre-install routine, ^DG53P861, will be installed to update all ID 
    FORMAT fields (#9) of the ELIGIBILITY CODE file (#8) that are currently 
    undefined.  All ID FORMAT fields (#9) that do not have a value will be 
    set to VA STANDARD.
    
 3. INC0000000615215 - $ZE=<UNDEFINED>CLS+19^DGPTF2 *DGREL
   
 Problem:
 --------   
  
    A sporadic undefined error is encountered when an attempt is made to close
    a PTF record using the LOAD/EDIT PATIENT DATA  [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
    Option.
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------  
   
    The problem is that information needed by the Registration Package is 
    deleted prematurely.  The PTF CORRECTIONS routine, ^DGPTF2, will be 
    modified to reset the information when needed.
