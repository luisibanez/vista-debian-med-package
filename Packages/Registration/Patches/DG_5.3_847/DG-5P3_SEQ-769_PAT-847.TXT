 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1. INC000000599219   Triggers ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE
                               (file #2,field #.119)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This field triggers the population of the ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field (#.12)
 of the PATIENT file (#2). It is incorrectly populating that field with the 
 local VAMC institution no matter what value is entered into the 
 ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119). It is only supposed to populate the 
 ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field (#.12) when "VAMC" is entered into the 
 ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119).  
 Also, The ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field (#.12) does not change if the ADDRESS
 CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119) is changed or deleted.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the trigger to the following:
 ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE="VAMC"
 Also, the CHANGE/DELETE CONDITION has been updated to delete the value 
 in the ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field if the ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE is 
 changed or deleted.
  
  
 2. INC000000599224   Triggers CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE
                               (file #2, field #.1311)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This field triggers the population of the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SITE 
 field (#.13111) of the PATIENT file (#2). It is incorrectly populating 
 that field with the local VAMC institution no matter what value is 
 entered into the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.1311). It is 
 only supposed to populate the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.13111)
 when "VAMC" is entered into the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE 
 field (#.1311).
 Also, The CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.12) does not change 
 if the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119) is changed or deleted.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the trigger to the following:
 CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE="VAMC"
 Also, the CHANGE/DELETE CONDITION has been updated to delete the value 
 in the CELLULAR NUMBER CHANGE SITE field if the CELLULAR NUMBER 
 CHANGE SOURCE is changed or deleted.
  
  
 3. INC000000599226   Triggers PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE
                               (file #2, field #.1313)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This field triggers the population of the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SITE 
 field (#.1314) of the PATIENT file (#2). It is incorrectly populating 
 that field with the local VAMC institution no matter what value is 
 entered into the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.1313). It is only 
 supposed to populate the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.1314) when 
 "VAMC" is entered into the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.1313).
 Also, The PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SITE field (#.12) does not change if 
 the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119) is changed or deleted. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the trigger to the following:
 PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SOURCE="VAMC"
 Also, the CHANGE/DELETE CONDITION has been updated to delete the value 
 in the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE SITE field if the PAGER NUMBER CHANGE 
 SOURCE is changed or deleted.
  
  
 4. INC000000599227   Triggers EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE 
                               (file #2, field #.137)
  
 Problem:
 --------
 This field triggers the population of the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SITE 
 field (#.138) of the PATIENT file (#2). It is incorrectly populating 
 that field with the local VAMC institution no matter what value is 
 entered into the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE field (#.137). It is 
 only supposed to populate the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field (#.138)
 when "VAMC" is entered into the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE 
 field (#.137).
 Also, The EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field (#.12) does not change if 
 the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE field (#.119) is changed or deleted.  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the trigger to the following:
 EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SOURCE="VAMC"
 Also, the CHANGE/DELETE CONDITION has been updated to delete the value 
 in the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE SITE field if the EMAIL ADDRESS CHANGE 
 SOURCE is changed or deleted.
