  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  HD0000000457200 - close out date modification request
   
  Problem:
  ========
  The Veterans Health Administration's (VHA) closeout dates for 
  all monthly and end of fiscal year updates for VHA corporate 
  patient data files are decreasing from the current requirement
  of 14 calendar days to 7 calendar days after the date of an encounter
  or discharge effective February 1, 2011. Currently the PTF Census 
  closeout is set for the 14th of the month following the census date.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  This patch changes the PTF quarterly census closeout date to the 7th
  of the month following the census date.
  
  If the 3/31/2011 census record exists in the PTF CENSUS DATE (#45.86)
  file, the post-initialization routine DG53P839 will update the
  CLOSEOUT DATE (#.02) field to 4/7/2011. This patch may be installed
  out of sequence if needed to update the CLOSEOUT DATE (#.02) field prior to
  the original closeout date of 4/14/2011. 
  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
