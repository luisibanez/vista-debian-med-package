 ------------------
  
 If 'NO' is answered at the first install question, the DGPF SUICIDE 
 FLAG parameter is installed with the default value of 'HIGH RISK FOR
 SUICIDE'.  
  
 If 'NO' was answered because the correct value was not known, or you 
 wish to change the parameter value at a later date, there is a 
 programmer utility that can be run from the post install routine.  At 
 a programmer prompt, enter 'D UPD^DG53836P'.  You will be prompted for 
 the new value you would like to assign to the Parameter Definition.
  
 'Enter the Local Patient Record flag that you are using as your Suicide
 Prevention flag. Local Flag:'  Enter the new value to be assigned
  
 If the update is successful you will see 'Parameter Definition has 
 been updated!', if the update was unsuccessful, you will see an 
 appropriate error message.  
  
 Routine DG53836P may be deleted once the Parameter Definition is 
 set up correctly.
