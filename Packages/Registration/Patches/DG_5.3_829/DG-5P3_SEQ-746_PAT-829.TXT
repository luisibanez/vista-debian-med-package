Subject: CLEAN UP INCONSISTENT DATA FILE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will be distributed in a host file along with patch IVM*2.0*147
 (PREVENT INCONSISTENT DATA ERRORS FOR MERGED PATIENTS). Patch IVM*2.0*147
 corrects a problem that is causing inconsistent data error records to be
 added to the INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) for merged patients during the
 process to build Z07 HL7 messages. These merged patient records are no
 longer valid records in the PATIENT file (#2) and as a result the
 inconsistencies cannot be resolved.
  
 This patch will run a post-install process that will check the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) for patient records that point to merged 
 patients in the PATIENT file (#2). These records will be deleted.

 HD0000000205864  Pointers in 301.5 not repointed in Patient Merge
 Duplicate:
    HD0000000370038  Unable To Clear Inconsistency
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The problem is inconsistent data records are being added to the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) for merged patients. This is caused by 
 records for merged patients remaining in the IVM PATIENT file (#301.5) 
 with the transmission flag set. During the process to build Z07 HL7 
 messages, consistency checks are done on the merged patient records and, 
 because these records are stub records in the PATIENT file (#2), a number 
 of inconsistencies are logged in the INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) and 
 cannot be resolved because the merged patient records are no longer valid.
   
 Solution:
 ---------
 A post-install process, DG53829P, will run that will check the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) for patient records that point to merged 
 patients in the PATIENT file (#2). These records will be deleted.
  
 Patch IVM*2.0*147, included in the host file with DG*5.3*829, made the 
 following changes to resolve this problem:
  
 The IVM BACKGROUND JOB routine, IVMPTRN, was modified to check if a 
 patient that is scheduled for a Z07 message transmission is a merged 
 patient, and if so, the patient's record is updated in the IVM PATIENT 
 file (#301.5) to remove it from the list of records awaiting 
 transmission. No further Z07 message processing will be done on that 
 record.
    
 Modifications were made to the IVMZ07C routine that checks patient data 
 for inconsistencies before building a Z07 message.  If the patient record 
 belongs to a merged patient, no inconsistencies will be filed in the 
 INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5).

 SOFTWARE RETRIEVAL
 ==================
  
 The software for this patch is not being distributed through the National 
 Patch Module. This patch is being distributed as a host file. The host 
 file will contain the following two KIDS builds:
  
             Host file name: IVM_2_P147.KID
  
                     Builds: IVM*2.0*147
                             DG*5.3*829
  
 Sites may retrieve the software directly using File Transfer Protocol 
 (FTP) from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at the following OI Field

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 The components sent with this patch, DG*5.3*829, have been included in the
 Host File IVM_2_P147.KID. Please follow the instructions listed in the 
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
 IVM*2.0*147.
  
  
  
 ****************** POST-INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS *******************
  
 A post-installation routine will automatically queue a job to run after
 the DG*5.3*829 patch installation has completed. The routine is DG53829P.
  
 The post-install job will 'clean up' the INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5) 
 by removing records that are pointing to merged patient records in the 
 PATIENT file (#2).
  
 Because this clean-up process will read through the entire INCONSISTENT 
 DATA file (#38.5), this job may take a while to run. A completion 
 bulletin will be sent to the mail group DGEN ELIGIBILITY ALERT when it 
 has successfully completed. If it does not complete or is stopped, it 
 can be restarted by running RESTART^DG53829P.
  
 The completion bulletin will look like this:

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 This message contains the results of the job to clean up records in
 the INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5).  Patient records that pointed to
 merged patients in the PATIENT file (#2) were deleted.
  
 The cleanup has run to completion.  Here are the results:
  
   Start Date/Time: Aug 29, 2011@07:30:11
     End Date/Time: Aug 29, 2011@07:35:20
  
   Total File #38.5 Records Processed: 110119
 Total Merged Patient Records Deleted: 36
  
 Deleted records are referenced in the global ^XTMP("DG53829","REC_DELETED"
  
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
 The results of the clean-up are stored in the ^XTMP("DG53829", global.
 NOTE:   The ^XTMP("DG53829" global at your site will be maintained for 
 six months, after which it will be automatically purged by a background 
 process that runs on every system.
  
 ^XTMP("DG53829","REC_DELETED",<Subscript 3>)=""
        Subscript 3: IEN of deleted record in the INCONSISTENT DATA file
                     (#38.5). It is also the DFN of the merged patient
                     record in the PATIENT file (#2).
        
  
 The rest of the global definition is:
  
 ^XTMP("DG53829","PARAMS")= four '^' pieces of data:
         Piece 1: Running count of the # of INCONSISTENT DATA file 
                  (#38.5) records that were deleted. 
         Piece 2: Last IEN read from INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5). 
         Piece 3: Running count of the # of records read in the 
                  INCONSISTENT DATA file (#38.5).
         Piece 4: "RUNNING", "STOPPED" or "DONE" to indicate the 
                  current status of the update job.
  
 ^XTMP("DG53829","RUNNING",<date/time of job start>)=date/time of job end 
  
 ^XTMP("DG53829","RUNNING",<date/time of job start>,<task #>)=""
  
  
 The post-install routine, DG53829P, can be deleted once the clean-up has 
 been successfully completed.
