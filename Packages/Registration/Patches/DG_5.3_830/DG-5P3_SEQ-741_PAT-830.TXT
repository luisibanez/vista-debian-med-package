Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the following issues:
  
 The Copay Exempt Test Needing Update At Next Appt. [DG CO-PAY TEST FUTURE
 LIST] report menu option is incorrectly including certain future-appointed
 patients whose latest, expired or soon-to expire Co-pay Exemption Tests
 have been converted by IVM.  Such cases need to be excluded from the
 report.
  
 With VistA sites' installation of one of the ESR 3.1/VOA patches 
 (DG*5.3*754), the Death Entry [DG DEATH ENTRY] option is no longer
 allowing users to enter a time value in conjunction with the date.  This 
 patch will restore that functionality.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ==========================
  
 1. HD326978   Copay Exemptions That Will Need Updating at Next Appt
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The Copay Exempt Test Needing Update At Next Appt. [DG CO-PAY TEST FUTURE
 LIST] report menu option is incorrectly including future-appointed
 Non-service Connected (NSC) and 0% Service Connected (SC) patients whose
 latest, expired or soon-to expire applicable Co-pay Exemption Tests have
 been converted by IVM. These cases need to be excluded from the report.  
 (Note:  cases where all is as above but Source of Income Test is not IVM
 should remain on the report.)
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine DGMTOFA to exclude any veterans with the following 
 criteria from the report:
  
 Existing RX Copay Test with Source of Income Test = IVM AND
 Primary eligibility code = NSC OR
 Primary eligibility code = SC Less than 50% and percentage is 0 and total 
 annual VA check amount is 0 (these three conditions go together in that if
 the eligibility code is SC Less than 50%, then the SC percentage has to be
 0 and the total annual VA check amount has to be 0.)
  
  
 2. HD476441 LEX Date of Death - Date Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 DG*5.3*754 modified the input transform on the DATE OF DEATH Field
 (#.351) of the PATIENT File (#2) to disallow an imprecise date in support 
 of ESR functionality. The change to the input transform inadvertently
 removed the ability of site users to enter a time value in conjunction 
 with the date of death.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The input transform on the DATE OF DEATH Field (#.351) of the PATIENT 
 File (#2) has been modified to add a "T" (allow time) into the %DT
 parameter. This will allow any site using the Death Entry [DG DEATH 
 ENTRY] option to specify a time value.
