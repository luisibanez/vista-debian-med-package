Subject: ADJUST DEP EFF DT/SPONSOR DOB; SITE OWNING MT CHK

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes two issues.  First, it introduces an additional check on
 the Dependent's Effective Date when entering a new Dependent using the
 Spouse/Dependent Add ("DA") protocol on the Family Demographic Data,
 Screen <8> in the Load/Edit Patient Data (DG LOAD PATIENT DATA) option on
 the Registration Menu.  This check will prevent the Effective Date from
 being prior to the Veteran's Date of Birth.
  
 Second, this patch will adjust a check introduced by DG*5.3*799 which was
 to prevent sites who are registering a patient from receiving the prompt
 to edit/complete a Means Test (through the Registration option) that was
 entered (owned) by another facility.  This check inadvertently prevented a
 division (such as a CBOC) and its parent site from being able to edit or
 complete each other's Means Tests.  This patch will adjust the check to
 account for divisions of the parent site, allowing more appropriate
 display of the Means Test prompt through the Registration options.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 1. HD0000000426181 - Dependent Effective Date allows a date prior to the 
 Veteran's Date of Birth when adding a new Dependent in VistA. 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 1.  VistA currently allows the user to enter a Dependent's Effective Date 
 prior to the Veteran's Date of Birth when adding a Dependent.  It 
 prevents the user from editing the Dependent's Effective Date to prior to 
 the Veteran's Date of Birth using the Edit Effective Date ("EE") protocol 
 under the Expand Dependent ("ED").  This is inconsistent logic processing.
  
 2.  If a Dependent's Effective Date prior to the Veteran's Date of Birth 
 is transmitted on the ORU-Z07 message, ESR processes the message and files
 the date.  If a user tries to edit the Dependent's information in ESR, an
 error message is received stating that: "The Dependent Effective Date must
 fall on or after the Veteran's Date of Birth."
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Logic is added to the Spouse/Dependent Add protocol that checks the 
 entered Effective Date for the Dependent.  If the Effective Date is prior 
 to the Veteran's Date of Birth, a warning message is displayed and the 
 Dependent is not added.
  
 2.  HD0000000453397 - Registration options are not prompting user to ask 
 if they want to complete Means Test at the end.
     HD0000000433027 - Users not being prompted to edit 'REQUIRED' means 
 tests in some situations where it would be appropriate.
  
 Problem:
 --------  
 1. Patch DG*5.3*799 released a modification to the Registration options 
 to prevent a site from editing or completing a Means Test which they do 
 not own.  After release, an additional set of circumstances were uncovered
 where if a CBOC (or division) is using the Registration options and the
 Means Test is owned by the parent site, the CBOC is not being presented
 the Means Test editing option. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------  
 Currently, the search for a match between site owning the MT and the 
 current site is a direct free text compare.  If the owning site, for 
 example is '581' (parent site) and the current site is '581GB' (a CBOC of 
 581), or if the owning site is the suffixed division and the current site 
 the parent, the match fails and the 'Means Test co-owner' relationship is 
 not recognized.  The code has been modified to strip out any division
 reference beginning with a letter when making the comparisons, so that
 only facility number to facility number is compared.
