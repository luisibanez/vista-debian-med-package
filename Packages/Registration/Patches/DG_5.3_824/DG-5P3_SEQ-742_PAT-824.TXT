Subject: FIX CALL LIST PROBLEMS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix two problems that are preventing patients from
 appearing on the NEW ENROLLEE APPOINTMENT REQUEST CALL LIST report 
 produced by the Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] option. Described below,
 these problems appear to be related to the implementation of features in
 DG*5.3*788 SEQ #708 'Add Preferred Facility to Call List.' Problem 1 was
 discovered during development of DG*5.3*824 and Problem 2 was reported by
 a site reviewing patch DG*5.3*788 after it was released.

 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000331777 - DG*5.3*788 possible list problem
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patients that should be appearing on the NEW ENROLLEE APPOINTMENT REQUEST 
 CALL LIST report produced by the Call List [DGEN NEACL MGT RPT1] option 
 are being omitted by two problems:
  
 1. Preferred Facility check - Changes were introduced by patch DG*5.3*788 
 so that only patients with a preferred facility that matched the site 
 printing the report would appear. However, the code is comparing the 
 record number (IEN) of the Institution file (#4) record for the site with 
 the station number of the patient's preferred facility. Unless the IEN 
 is the same as the station number this check will fail.
  
 2. Non-Count Clinic Appointment - A patient that appeared on the Call 
 List will be omitted if a non-count clinic appointment is made. An 
 appointment in a non-count clinic should not remove the patient from the 
 Call List. The problem is caused by the following fields in the PATIENT 
 file (#2) becoming populated when the appointment is made:
  
           APPOINTMENT REQUEST STATUS field #1010.161  
           DATE STATUS LAST EDITED field #1010.162 
           APPOINTMENT REQUEST COMMENT field #1010.163 
           DATE COMMENT LAST EDITED FIELD #1010.164 
  
 If these fields are populated, the patient will not appear on the Call 
 List. These fields should not get populated for an appointment in a 
 non-count clinic.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1. A change was made to the routine DGENACL. The variable DGSITE will be 
 set to the site's station number, not the site's record number in the 
 INSTITUTION file (#4). The station number of the patient's preferred 
 facility will now be compared to the station number of the site printing 
 the report.
  
 2. A fix has been added to the routine DGENA2 to check whether the
 patient's appointment is being made in a non-count clinic. If so, the
 fields listed above will not be populated and the otherwise non-appointed
 patient will properly remain on the call list.
  
 Note:  This patch checks new enrollees' non-count clinic appointments
 made from the time of installation forward. It does not check for
 enrollees appointed before that time and restore their names to the call
 list.
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Salisbury VAMC (Large)

 Puget Sound HCS (Large/Integrated)
