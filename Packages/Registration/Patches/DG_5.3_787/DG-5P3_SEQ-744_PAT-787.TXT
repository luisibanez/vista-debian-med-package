Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects two SAC (Standards and Conventions) violations.  
  
  ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
  ==========================
  1) HD0000000170842 - Cannot access patient records

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
   1) HD0000000170842 - Cannot access patient records
     
   Problem:
   ========
   There is an untimed lock in DGPTTS3.  This violates SAC requirements.   
   When accessing a record that is currently being edited, this causes
   the VistA system to appear as though it has hung.   
  
   Solution:
   =========
   Modify DGPTTS3 to have a timed lock.  If a lock cannot be obtained, the 
   user will be notified that the record is in use.  The process will 
   continue to attempt to access the record until it becomes available.  
  
   2) HD0000000064699 - ISB-0105-31063  SAC compliance issues - DGPTFTR
     
   Problem:
   ========
   There is a lock in DGPTFTR which is using the wrong time out and is not
   incremental.  Both are in violation of the SAC.  
  
   Solution:
   =========
   Modify DGPTFTR to have a timed lock.  If a lock cannot be obtained, the 
   user will be notified that the record is in use.
