Description:
============

  DG*5.3*688, DG*5.3*772, DG*5.3*837, and DG*5.3*856 are required builds
  for patch DG*5.3*863.
   
  NOTE: Patches DG*5.3*863, RG*1*60, and MPIF*1*57 are being released
  together.  It is recommended that all three patches be installed on
  the same date if possible.  Each patch contains functionality related
  to the display of the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  All
  three patches must be in place nationally for the full ICN to display
  in all of the stated options.
    
  Issue #1
  In certain instances, a patient's current residential address may be a
  foreign address (e.g., for a Department of Defense (DoD) patient).
  The following foreign address fields were added to the Patient MPI/PD 
  Data Inquiry and Display Remote Patient Data Query displays.
      PROVINCE from the PATIENT (#2) file, field .1171,
      POSTAL CODE from the PATIENT (#2) file, field .1172, and
      COUNTRY from the PATIENT (#2) file, field .1173.
  If the PATIENT (#2) file COUNTRY (.1173) field is null or if the entry
  it points to in the COUNTRY CODE (#779.004) file has CODE (.01) field
  equal to "USA", then the PATIENT (#2) file CITY (.114), STATE (.115),
  and ZIP CODE (.116) fields are displayed.
  If the PATIENT (#2) file COUNTRY (.1173) field is NOT null and the CODE  
  (.01) field of the COUNTRY CODE file (#779.004) entry that it points to
  is NOT equal to "USA", then the PATIENT (#2) file CITY (.114), PROVINCE  
  (.1171), COUNTRY (.1173) name, and POSTAL CODE (.1172) fields, if
  populated, are displayed.
   
  Issue #2
  The Patient MPI/PD Data Inquiry [RG EXCEPTION TF INQUIRY] and Display
  Remote Patient Data Query [RG REMOTE PDAT DISPLAY] options will now
  display the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  The full ICN includes
  the PATIENT (#2) file INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (991.01) field, 
  followed by a "V", followed by the ICN CHECKSUM (991.02) field,
  and is retrieved by calling the GETICN^MPIF001 API.
   
  Issue #3
  The concept of a COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD (CMOR) was replaced in
  2007 when patch MPI*1.0*40 was installed on the Master Veteran Index
  (MVI). At that time, the Primary View methodology began as
  an enterprise view of the most current data for a patient based on
  authority scoring and the data rules.  There are some places in VistA
  where the obsolete COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD terminology is still
  displayed.  With this patch the words COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD
  have been removed from the following Registration features:
      Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
      Register a Patient[DG REGISTER PATIENT]
      PATIENT HAS EXPIRED mail message generated when DATE OF DEATH is
      entered for a patient.
    
  Issue #4
  When the Master Veteran Index (MVI) sent an A19 query message to a
  facility for a specific patient DFN, if that patient DFN had been the
  "merged-from" record in a duplicate record merge and was merged into a
  different DFN, then the query returned an error message to the MVI.
  A code change in routine VAFCQRY will now return the ICN of the
  "merged-to" patient so that the records can be updated on the MVI.
    
  Issue #5
  To address Remedy ticket HD0000000460869 reported by Health Care
  Identity Management (HC IdM), a code change has been made in routine
  VAFCAUD.  Under certain circumstances, corrupt data in the local VistA
  AUDIT (#1.1) file caused the Display Remote Patient Audit [MPI DATA
  MGT REM DISP PAUD QRY] report on the MVI to fail.  This occurred
  when a field was previously marked for auditing and was later removed,
  but the field reference remained in the AUDIT (#1.1) file.  Code
  modifications have been made to prevent an undefined error.
          
  Issue #6
  To address Remedy ticket INC000000841436 reported by Health Care
  Identity Management (HC IdM), modifications have been made in
  routines VAFCTFIN, VAFCTFU2, and VAFCTFU3.  For a submitted
  identifier, the VAFC LOCAL GETCORRESPONDINGIDS Remote Procedure Call
  (RPC) returns a list of the Treating Facilities/correlations for that
  patient.  Previously, the code did not include My HealtheVet (MHV) as
  a correlation in the list unless the ROI SIGNED INDICATOR (.08) field
  in the TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file for the record was equal
  to 1 (or YES).  This conditional code has been eliminated.  Processing
  of the Health Level Seven (HL7) MFN-M05 messages which update the
  TREATING FACILITY LIST (#391.91) file is being changed to allow the
  removal of records that do not have an associated DFN or if the
  correlation is MHV, regardless of the ROI SIGNED INDICATOR (.08)
  field value.
   
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patches DG*5.3*863,
  MPIF*1.0*57, and RG*1.0*60.  Facilities should download the revised
  documentation listed as follows:
   
      User Manual                         RG1_0_UM.PDF
      Technical Manual                    RG1_0_TM.PDF
      Exception Handling                  RG1_0_EH.PDF
   
  The preferred retrieval method is to FTP from the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directory at: DOWNLOAD.VISTA.DOMAIN.EXT
  This transmits the file from the first available FTP server.
  Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from one
  of the following servers.
