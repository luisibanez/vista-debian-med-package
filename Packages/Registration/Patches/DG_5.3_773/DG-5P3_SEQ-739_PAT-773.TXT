Subject: MEANS TEST EVENT DRIVER UPDATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following problem: 
   
 Income Verification Match (IVM) sometimes converts a veteran's Copay 
 Exemption (or Means) Test, even though the VistA rules determine that the 
 veteran is not subject to this test based on his or her eligibility.  
 Whenever VistA's Means Test event driver is triggered for such a veteran, 
 it resets the Status of the test to No Longer Applicable (or No Longer 
 Required) and displays a message announcing the test's new Status.  This 
 is problematical, because no VistA function should be altering IVM tests
 and thus overriding IVM decisions.
  
 Under the described scenario, VistA's Means Test event driver should be
 limited to never update the Status of an IVM-converted test.
  
 Change Request referenced is: CR6887

 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s): 
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000202487  Means Test Conversion problem
      DUPLICATE:  HD0000000261838  Facility overrode IVM RX Copay Required
                                    Entry
   
   
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s): 
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000202487, HD0000000261838 
    Problem: IVM uses criteria that differs from VistA to determine if a
             Means Test or Copay Test is required for a patient.  This can 
             result in the upload of a converted test for a patient with a 
             status that is other than No Longer Required or No Longer
             Applicable.  Whenever the Means Test event driver is run for
             that patient, the VistA system will update that IVM test's
             status to be one of these two statuses.  This results in the
             site overriding the IVM decision, which should not be allowed.
             
    Resolution: Add a flag in the Means Test event driver to NOT update the
             Status of a Copay Exemption Test or Means Test if the test has
             been converted by IVM.
  
 For the purposes of this fix, the following rules will be used:
   
 1)  If the SOURCE OF INCOME TEST field, #.23, in the ANNUAL MEANS TEST
 file (#408.31) is equal to "IVM"
 OR
 2)  the DATE IVM VERIFIED MT COMPLETED field, #.25, in the ANNUAL MEANS 
 TEST file (#408.31) is populated, 
  
 then the test will be considered an IVM-converted test and will not be 
 touched.
