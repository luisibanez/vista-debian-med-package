Subject: CE ALERT AND ED OBSERVATION CORRECTIONS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will correct the date of birth in the Patient Identification fields
 (before edit) of the POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EDIT (CE) OF PATIENT IDENTIFYING 
 DATA alert. It will also add Emergency Department (ED) Observation Treating 
 Specialty for Application Programming Interface (API) to ask readmit question 
 after a patient has been discharged.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ===============
  1) HD0000000394095 Potential Cat Edit Warning Message-DOB Error
   
  Problem:
  ========
  Healthcare Identity Management found for some records that 
  there was an incorrect date of birth in the (before edit) 
  section of the POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC EDIT OF PATIENT 
  IDENTIFYING DATA alert.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Corrected routines DGRPECE and DGRPECE1 to correctly store 
  and display data on the alerts.
  
  
  2) HD0000000409065 1 Observation clinic dc'ing orders without asking the 
                     readmit question
    
  Problem:
  ========
  Emergency room discharge is not asking if a patient is to be readmitted.
  An API used by Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) has 
  Observation clinics hard coded and ED Observation clinic is not part of it.
  
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Changed API DGPMOBS to include ED Observation clinic as one of the 
  clinics that will need to be asked if a patient is to be readmitted.
    
    
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system, HOWEVER because
  certain Registration options need to be placed out of order, we strongly
  suggest it be installed after business hours. It should take less than 
  5 minutes to install.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
    
       NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
              global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed
              you will need to repeat this step.
    
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter DG*5.3*831):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package DG*5.3*831.
    
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', respond NO.
    
   6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
       Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
       When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
       enter:
              Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT]
              Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA]
              Preregister a Patient [DGPRE PRE-REGISTER OPTION]
              Collateral Patient Register [DG COLLATERAL PATIENT]  
    
       When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
       Order':', hit enter.
