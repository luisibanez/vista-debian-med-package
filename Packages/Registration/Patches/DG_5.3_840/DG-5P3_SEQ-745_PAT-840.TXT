  *********************************ATTENTION***********************************
  Note:  This patch is an emergency released with a 48-hour compliance.
   
         This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System
         Re-design (ESR) 3.5 Public Law 111-163 project.  DG*5.3*840 is being
         released along with IB*2*449 (Integrated Billing) and IVM*2*149
         (Income Verification Match) in host file: DG_53_P840.KID.
   
         It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
         compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
  *****************************************************************************
   
  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the Enrollment
  System Redesign (ESR) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility
  (Vista REE) software to support the requirements of Public Law 111-163.
  On May 5, 2010, the President signed into law, Public Law (PL) 111-163, 
  the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.  This law
  provides assistance to caregivers of Veterans and improves the provisions
  of health care services to Veterans.  Section 511, Prohibitions on
  collections of copayments from Veterans who are Catastrophically
  Disabled.  This patch is being issued in support of some of these
  provisions.
   
  With the installation of this patch and the other related patches,
  IB*2*449 and IVM*2*149, Veterans who are identified as being
  Catastrophically Disabled will no longer be charged copayments for Means
  Test/Geographic Means Test related Outpatient Visits, Inpatient Visits
  and Outpatient Medications from the effective date of their
  Catastrophically Disabled determination and installation forward.  This
  does not affect Extended Care/Long Term Care Copayments.  These patches
  do not cancel charges created prior to the installation.  Sites should
  continue to use the Chief Business Office guidance they have been
  provided to cancel those previously billed charges where necessary.
   
  To provide support for the cancellation of charges that have occurred 
  since the effective date of May 5, 2010 for Catastrophically  Disabled, a
  new Reasons Not Billable are being added to the IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS
  (#350.3) for selection during all types of cancellations of copayments:
   
        CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED
   
  To assist in identifying charges already created for Catastrophically 
  Disabled patients, a new report Catastrophically Disabled Copay Report [IB
  CD CHARGE REPORT] is being added to the Patient Billing Reports Menu [IB
  OUTPUT PATIENT REPORT MENU].  During installation of this patch the report
  will be produced automatically for charges that were created since May 5,
  2010 and the patient's Catastrophically Disability effective date.  This
  report needs a printer of at least 132 columns.  It is important this
  report is shared with the site's revenue department.  If needed the report
  can be re-run by the new menu option.
