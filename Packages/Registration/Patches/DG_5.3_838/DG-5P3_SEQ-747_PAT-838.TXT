Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) system to support technology and 
 business changes that are occurring with the implementation of the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) Preferred Facility project, Change 
 Request (CR) 9620.
  
 Currently, a Veteran selects a Preferred Facility (PF) at the time of 
 application for enrollment. The Preferred Facility information is rarely 
 updated by the Veteran and is not linked to the location where the 
 Veteran actually receives care. As a result, the value of the preferred 
 facility assignment is limited. CR 9620 specifies changes needed in the 
 way that a Veteran's Preferred Facility is entered and stored in ESR and 
 VistA. These changes are necessitated by the requirements of the 
 Veterans Benefit Handbook Project.
  
  
 This patch modifies the Registration v5.3 application as follows:
  
 1. VistA is modified to support the population of the SOURCE DESIGNATION
 field (#27.03) for the preferred facility.  The SOURCE DESIGNATION field
 (#27.03) is a new field added to the PATIENT file (#2).  The SOURCE
 DESIGNATION field (#27.03) is a set of codes consisting of the
 following values:
  
             'V' FOR VISTA 
             'E' FOR ESR 
             'PA' FOR PCP ACTIVE
             'PI' FOR PCP INACTIVE
       
 The SOURCE DESIGNATION field (#27.03) value is automatically set by
 the Enrollment System (ES) or the VistA system.
  
 2. The VistA software will only allow a user to edit the PREFERRED 
 FACILITY field (#27.02) if the veteran's SOURCE DESIGNATION field (#27.03)
 value is 'V' for VistA or 'PI' for PCP Inactive.
  
 3. The VistA software will display the following help text if a user 
 attempts to edit the PREFERRED FACILITY field (#27.02) of a record whose
 SOURCE DESIGNATION field (#27.03) value is not editable by the VistA
 software.
  
 "Preferred Facility can only be edited/modified by an ESR user, please 
 contact the HEC to request changes/edits"
       
 The SOURCE DESIGNATION field (#27.03) values deemed not editable by the
 VistA software are 'E' for ESR and 'PA' for PCP Active.
  
 4. Once ESR has assigned the Preferred Facility value, VistA users will
 not be allowed to change the value.
  
 5. Modify VistA to trigger a Z07 HL7 message to be sent to ESR when the
 PREFERRED FACILITY field (#27.02) has been assigned/modified.
  
 6. Modify VistA to store the PREFERRED FACILITY feild (#27.02) and
 associated SOURCE DESIGNATION field (#27.03) in the PATIENT file (#2). If
 VistA receives a Z11 HL7 message with Preferred Facility, display what ESR
 sent in the Patient Enrollment [DGEN PATIENT ENROLLMENT] menu.
  
 7. PREFERRED FACILITY field (#27.02) shall be changed to a required field
 and must be entered by a VistA user when the veteran is first
 registered/enrolled in the VA Medical Center.

               DESCRIPTION:      Source designation contains the value of 
                                 the place the Preferred Facility field
                                 (#27.02) was  assigned for the patient.  
                                 Source designation is automatically
                                 assigned by the system. The VistA system
                                 can only assign a Preferred Facility if
                                 the current Source Designation is VistA or
                                 Primary Care Provider (PCP) Inactive.
