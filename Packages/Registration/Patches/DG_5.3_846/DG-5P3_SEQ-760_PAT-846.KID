to edit data about missing veterans, answer yes.  If you respond no, the

"^DD",391,391,102,23,1,0)
Because FM will not allow more than 100 pieces on a node, editable items
"^DD",391,391,102,23,2,0)
on screen 10 or greater had to be moved to the new E10 node.  The fields
"^DD",391,391,102,23,3,0)
were numbered so that the field number was equal to screen#_item# and the
"^DD",391,391,102,23,4,0)
piece position on the node was equal to the field number.  Because the
"^DD",391,391,102,23,5,0)
missing data is on screen 10, it is not possible to put it on the same
"^DD",391,391,102,23,6,0)
node (because there can not be more than 100 pieces).  Registration will
"^DD",391,391,102,23,7,0)
need to check to see if the screen is 10 or greater and, if so, look at
"^DD",391,391,102,23,8,0)
this new node.
