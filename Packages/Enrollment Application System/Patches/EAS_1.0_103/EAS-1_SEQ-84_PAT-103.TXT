Subject: STORE ERROR IN GATHER VISTA INSURANCE DATA TO PRINT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patch IB*2*416 'EIV Enhancements - Phase 3 Iteration 1' introduced the
 collection of eIV Eligibility/Benefit information from third party
 insurance payers by adding a new sub-file into the existing INSURANCE TYPE
 sub-file (#2.312) of the PATIENT File (#2).  This enhancement has allowed
 for the possibility of a large amount of data to now be stored into the
 INSURANCE TYPE fields.  Existing code for the DG Registration 10/10
 Reprint [10-10 Print] option utilized a database server call to retrieve
 all Insurance Type information into a local variable for processing and
 printing the Form 10-10EZ.  With the additional data now being collected,
 it's possible in certain circumstances to overload the local variable when
 the database server call is made.  This can result in a <STORE> error
 being generated in the system (which may or may not appear in the error
 trap.) This patch makes a modification to the current code to limit the
 data being retrieved and stored from the insurance sub-file to only the
 specific insurance fields required for the 10-10 Print option to minimize 
 the possibility of the <STORE> error being generated.

 1. HD0000000446802  <STORE>^DIQGQ  Unable to print means test
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Cannot print 1010 on 1 patient
  
 Site is having a problem with printing a 10-10 on a certain patient.  A 
 <STORE>  error is being generated.  It looks like the insurance subfile 
 is the issue.  Our MAS and Finance Adpacs are unable to detect any issues 
 to correct.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The routine EASEZPVI which gathers VistA insurance data to print the 
 10-10 EAS form uses the following database server call to retrieve 
 ALL the insurance information for a patient before printing the 10-10EZ 
 form: 
  
     D GETS^DIQ(2.312,INDA_","_EASDFN,"**","IE","INSUR")
  
 This information is stored in a local parameter.  If there is a large 
 amount of third party eIV Eligibility/Benefit information stored in 
 these insurance multiples, the potential exists for overloading the 
 system and generating a <STORE> error.
  
 This line of code is being modified to retrieve only the specific data 
 pieces currently required for printing the 10-10EZ form and greatly 
 reduce the size the local parameter being generated, thereby minimizing 
 the potential for the <STORE> error.
