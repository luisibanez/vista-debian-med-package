  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2011-###, new effective rates for Means 
 Test Thresholds, GMT Thresholds, and RX Copay Thresholds will go into 
 effect January 1, 2012. To ensure compliance with the forthcoming VHA 
 Directive, EAS*1.0*104 MUST be installed by December 28, 2011. This patch
 is being released as an Emergency patch together with DG*5.3*848 (2012
 Means Test Thresholds) and IB*2.0*465 (2012 RX Copay Thresholds) and may
 be installed out of sequence with respect to other released EAS patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
  
 The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2012 provided
 in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2011-###, MEANS TEST AND GEOGRAPHIC-BASED
 MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012 are distributed with this
 patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS file (#712.5) are used in
 the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold for a given income year,
 based on locality and number of dependents.
  
 Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. Department
 of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This large set of income 
 thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic based 
 income limits for Income Year (IY) 2011 can be found January 1, 2012 at:
 http://www4.va.gov/healtheligibility/Library/AnnualThresholds.asp
  
 This patch, EAS*1.0*104, is one of three VistA 2012 threshold patches.  
 It addresses the annual updates for the GMT Thresholds. Patch DG*5.3*848
 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum Annual 
 Pension Rate. Patch IB*2.0*465 will address the annual updates for the 
 Pharmacy Copay Thresholds.
