Description:
============

  Per VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST, GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND
  PENSION THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2013, this patch MUST be installed
  before January 1, 2013. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch
  together with DG*5.3*860 (2013 Means Test Thresholds) and IB*2.0*485 (2013
  RX Copay Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect to
  other released EAS patches.
   
  The Geographic-Based Means Test thresholds for Calendar Year 2013 are
  distributed with this patch. The updated values for the GMT THRESHOLDS
  file (#712.5) are used in the determination of a veteran's GMT Threshold
  for a given income year, based on locality and number of dependents.
   
  Geographical income level thresholds are set yearly by the U.S. 
  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This large set of 
  income thresholds is usually referred to as the HUD index. The geographic
  based income limits for Income Year (IY) 2012 can be found January 1, 2013
