Subject: 1010EZ CHANGES FOR MSDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) system to support technology and 
 business changes that are occurring with the implementation of the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) 
 project.
  
 The MSDS project will introduce an MSDS Broker that will be activated in 
 ESR. The Broker will construct a definitive military service data set 
 including data received from the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), the
 Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS) and VistA.
 Once the MSDS Broker is activated, ESR becomes the authoritative source
 for Military Service Episode data. The verified data will be shared from
 ESR to all VistA sites of record for the veteran. The ESR-verified
 Military Service Episode data cannot be edited by VistA except to add new
 episodes. An unlimited number of military service episodes per veteran
 will now be supported.
  
 This patch is being released along with patches DG*5.3*797, IVM*2.0*141, 
 DVB*4.0*62, and PXRM*2.0*21 in host file DG_53_P797.KID.
     
 This patch modifies the Enrollment Application System v1.0 as described
 below:
   
  
 1.  Modify Electronic 10-10EZ Processing
 ----------------------------------------
 The MSDS changes introduced by patch DG*5.3*797 include a new MILITARY 
 SERVICE EPISODE sub-file (#2.3216) added to the PATIENT file (#2) to store
 the veteran's military service episodes (MSE).  Modifications were made to
 the Electronic 10-10EZ Processing option to store military service data,
 entered electronically through the web-based application, into the new MSE
 location in the PATIENT file (#2).  If authoritative military service data
 has already been received from ESR, the filing of MSE data from the
 electronic 10-10EZ will be blocked and a message will be displayed to the
 user.
  
 2.  Modify 10-10EZ Printing
 ---------------------------
 Printing the 10-10EZ was changed to get the veteran's last service 
 episode data from the new sub-file location in the PATIENT file (#2).
  
 3.  Update fields in the 1010EZ MAPPING file (#711)
 ---------------------------------------------------
 For the records related to the Last Service Episode, the data dictionary 
 locations in the 1010EZ MAPPING file (#711) fields MAP-TO SUB-FILE (#3) 
 and MAP-TO FIELD (#4) were changed to the new MILITARY SERVICE EPISODE 
 sub-file (#2.3216).  The file updates will be done by the post-install 
 routine EAS1092P.
