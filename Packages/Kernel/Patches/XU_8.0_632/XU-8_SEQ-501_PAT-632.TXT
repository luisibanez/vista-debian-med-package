Associated patches: (v)XU*8*602    <<= must be installed BEFORE `XU*8*632'

Subject: DISPLAY UNPROCESSED ALERTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Patches XU*8*513 and XU*8*602 made changes to alert processing to sort 
 critical alerts at the top of the users' processing lists.  As a result, 
 since XU*8*602 was installed, users that have a large number of 
 unprocessed alerts may see a noticeable delay or pause when their VistA 
 menus are displaying while their alerts are being sorted.
  
 This patch will improve the efficiency of the VistA Menu Manager when 
 informing the user that there are alerts to process by sorting through 
 only the most recent alerts.  When the user chooses to begin processing 
 alerts, the complete list of unprocessed alerts will then be sorted and 
 presented to the user.
  
 To identify which users might be impacted by this patch, a FileMan 
 Inquiry can be used to quickly check on the number of unprocessed alerts 
 for users:
  
    Select OPTION:    INQUIRE TO FILE ENTRIES
  
    OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: ALERT// 
    Select ALERT RECIPIENT:  User,Alert     
    ANOTHER ONE: 
    STANDARD CAPTIONED OUTPUT? Yes// N  (No)
    FIRST PRINT FIELD:      ALERT DATE/TIME    (multiple)
      FIRST PRINT ALERT DATE/TIME SUB-FIELD: +.01  ALERT DATE/TIME
      THEN PRINT ALERT DATE/TIME SUB-FIELD: 
    THEN PRINT FIELD: 
    Heading (S/C): ALERT STATISTICS// 
    DEVICE:   TELNET PORT    Right Margin: 132// 
  
 Before this patch is installed, anyone that has more than a few hundred 
 unprocessed alerts will likely see a noticeable "hang" while their menus
 display.
  
 You can also run "User Alerts Count Report" [XQAL USER ALERTS COUNT] to 
 identify users which may be experiencing delays.  Basically anyone with
 more than a few hundred entries may have this problem.
  
    Select Report Menu for Alerts Option: User Alerts Count Report
    Do you want to count only alerts containing specific words or
    phrase(s)? NO
    Display users whose ALERT count is at least:  100// 200
    START DATE:  T-900
    END DATE:  (10/31/2010 - 4/18/2013): T
    Breakout by One or More Divisions? NO
  
         Select one of the following:
                   
              1         By Name
              2         By Number
              3         By Service/Section
  
    Select the ordering of results desired: 1  By Name
    DEVICE: HOME//   SSH VIRTUAL TERMINAL    Right Margin: 80// 
  
    COUNT of ALERTS - users with more than 200 on Apr 18, 2013@08:22:44
    for date range 10/31/2010 to 04/18/2013
    CRIT column indicates number of CRITICAL alerts and ABNORMAL IMAGING 
    alerts
  
 The best way to fix the delay is for the user to process or delete their 
 unprocessed alerts.  Consideration should also be given to deciding if a 
 user that has so many unprocessed alerts has a valid need for getting the 
 alerts at all.
  
 If IRM knows that all of the Alerts for a user can be deleted (do not 
 need follow-up action or review) then the "Purge Alerts for a User" 
 [XQALERT BY USER DELETE] option can be run, selecting "A" to delete all 
 alerts.  This option requires the XQAL-DELETE security key to be used.

 1. INC0000000843877 Alerts Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Patches XU*8*513 and XU*8*602 made changes to alert processing to sort 
 critical alerts to the top of the users' processing lists.  As a result, 
 since XU*602 was installed, users that have a large number of unprocessed
 alerts may see a delay or pause when their VistA menus are displaying
 while their alerts are being sorted.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Only the most recent alerts need to be displayed at the Menu Manager 
 prompt.  A change has been made to only look for recent alerts 
 at the Menu Manager prompt.  A more comprehensive list will then be 
 displayed when the user begins to process alerts.
