                 XU*8*598
  
 This patch fixes the problem on the API $$TRIM^XLFSTR that does not 
 always behave as expected when 'R'(right), or 'L'(left) is passed as the 
 2nd parameter. If a string with more than one space is passed with 'R', 
 or 'L' as the 2nd parameter, a single space is returned. It should return 
 the null value.
  
 For example:
  
 Before patch:     
  
 ISC>W $L($$TRIM^XLFSTR("    ","R"))
 1              <<<< It should be zero "0"
  
 After patch:
  
 ISC>W $L($$TRIM^XLFSTR("    ","R"))
 0
  
 This patch also includes the Post-Routine XU8P598 to clear bogus nodes 
 on the sub-file Affects Record Merge (#9.402) in the Package File (9.4) 
 for Kernel. The bogus nodes causes a problem on the PATIENT merge process.
 When doing a PATIENT merge in VistA, the MPI(MASTER PATIENT INDEX) is 
 being sent two HL7 ADT-A40 Patient Merge messages, but we should only get 
 one.
