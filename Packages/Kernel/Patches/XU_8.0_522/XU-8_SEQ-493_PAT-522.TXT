Subject: ACTIVATE BROKER SECURITY ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a series of patches shutting down CAPRI visitor
 access and transitioning to the more secure Broker Security Enhancement
 (BSE) visitor access.
  
 Patches XU*8*404 and XWB*1.1*45 provided the basis for the Broker Security
 Enhancement (BSE) and provided applications which used the CAPRI visitor 
 access with time to switch to the connection mechanisms provided in the 
 BSE. Subsequently, patches XU*8*523 and XWB*1.1*53 provided support for
 Imaging, VistA Web, and Medical Domain Web Services (MDWS) with support
 for their use of the CAPRI visitor access. Patch XU*8*595 fixed a BSE 
 issue and provided logging to help debug any future BSE issues.
  
 Now, almost six years later, this patch provides a parameter that gives 
 sites the capability to trap CAPRI visitor access login attempts (for 
 troubleshooting) and/or completely shut down CAPRI visitor access (for 
 added security) and force usage of the Broker Security Enhancement.
  
 All sites, please follow these instructions below: 
   1. Install patch XU*8*522 (see Installation Instructions below).
      
   2. Monitor your system for any user login / access problems. If there
      are no new problems, you are done! 
      
   3. If you suspect there are any new user login / access problems after
      installing patch XU*8*522, use the parameter XU522 (see example
      below) to help troubleshoot. The parameter has four possible values:
  
       Y (YES) to disable CAPRI logins (the default behavior if not set).
       E (ERROR) to disable CAPRI logins and trap attempts.
       N (NO) to leave CAPRI logins enabled.
       L (DEBUG) to leave CAPRI logins enabled but trap attempts.
  
      Note: This parameter is created by the installation, and is set to a 
      value of "N" by a post-installation routine to leave CAPRI logins
      enabled.
  
      To troubleshoot and to determine which applications may still be 
      using CAPRI access to log onto your system, trap CAPRI login attempts
      by setting the XU522 parameter to "E" or "L". Monitor the error trap
      for trapped errors with a subject "OLDCAPRI LOGIN ATTEMPT". If any
      such errors are found, file a Remedy ticket and examine the symbol
      table to determine what application(s) are still trying to use CAPRI
      to login to your system.
      
      If service to an application is being interrupted by this patch 
      disabling CAPRI, you can enable CAPRI logins by changing the XU522
      parameter to either "N" or "L" to re-enable the CAPRI logins until
      the issue is resolved with the specific application(s) that may still
      using CAPRI logins.
      
   4. Setting the XU522 parameter can be done from General Parameter Tools
      menu under the CPRS Configuration (IRM) menu. It can also be set by
      running the routine XPAREDIT.
      
   5. Once any problems are resolved, debugging can be turned off by 
      setting the XU522 parameter back to "Y" or "N".
