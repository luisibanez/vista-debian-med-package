Subject: Connector Proxy Updates

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Remedy tickets: 
 - HD0000000424203
 - HD0000000493429 
  
 Thank you to the following test sites: 
 - Montrose, NY (VA Hudson Valley HCS)
 - Mountain Home, TN (James H. Quillen VAMC)
 - Philadelphia VAMC
  
 Functionality:
 ============== 
 (1) After this patch, new verify codes entered for CONNECTOR PROXY
     accounts must be at least 12 characters in length, per VA Handbook
     6500 requirements for service accounts.
  
 (2) For CONNECTOR PROXY accounts, the NEW PERSON (#200) field DATE VERIFY
     CODE LAST CHANGED (#11.2) is now properly recorded as the actual date
     changed, for the CONNECTOR PROXY user.
  
 (3) A new report is assists with the management of connector proxy
     accounts. It comes as two options added to the User Management Menu
     [XUOPTUSER]:
  
     - Proxy (Connector) Detail Report [XUSAP PROXY CONN DETAIL ALL]
     - Proxy (Connector) Inquire [XUSAP PROXY CONN DETAIL INQ]
  
    The report:
    
    - Lists whether accounts are compliant with having verify codes
      changed within the last 3 years.
    - Optionally analyzes if any fields are populated inappropriately.
    - Optionally lists signon activity for by account, sorted by
      connecting client IP address and signon date.
  
 NOTE: Some connector proxy accounts may be annotated in the report with
 the comment:
  
   Compliant w/3-year Service Account Mandate? *** NO <---- MUST FIX ***
  
 It is *STRONGLY* recommend to file a Remedy ticket under VistALink in
 these cases, rather than immediately changing the verify code. This is to
 avoid interruptions of service in national applications dependent on
 VistALink connectivity and the particular connector proxy account(s) in
 question. VA IT Engineering staff will assist sites in the process of
 updating (or creating new) connector proxy accounts, and coordinating with
 national data centers as needed, to minimize the possibility 
 of interruptions in service.
