Category:

Description:
============

 Remedy ticket:  - HD0000000404070
  
 The $$TF^XUAF4 API returns active treating facilities.  Station
 740 - TEXAS VALLEY COASTAL BEND HCS - is a special case exception
 to the station number scheme, so the logic needed to include this
 exception.  This patch implements the fix.
  
 Remedy ticket:  - HD0000000449781
  
 The patch adds VISN 99 to the Institution (#4) file.
  
 Remedy ticket:  - HD0000000455552
  
 The patch fixes the $$IEN^XUMF API for Institution lookups to use
 the "D" cross-reference of file 4 instead of "XUMFIDX".  This fixes
 a CMOP application.
