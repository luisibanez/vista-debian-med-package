Subject: INSTITUTION DUP FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Remedy tickets:  - HD0000000461704
  
 This patch looks for duplicate field STATION NUMBER (#99) in the
 INSTITUTION (#4) file, sets the INACTIVE FACILITY FLAG (#101)
 to INACTIVE, deletes the STATION NUMBER (#99), and places ZZ DUP 
 at beginning of the NAME (#.01) field for any duplicate records found.
  
 In particular the patch resolves the known duplication of station
 number 740 - TEXAS VALLEY COASTAL BEND HCS.  This must be corrected
 immediately before facility setup can continue.
