Subject: Fix TaskMan 'Spacebar Return' Feature

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes problems in the Device Manager involving the use of the
 'spacebar return' functionality for selecting the last device used at the 
 device prompt.  On occasion it has been reported that this functionality
 caused the selection of an inappropriate device, such as a resource device, 
 for printing.  This has been demonstrated to occur by using certain
 CRPRS and some HealthEVet applications, and then selecting a device at the
 legacy VistA device prompt.
  
 This issue can result in errors in the Kernel Error Trap from trying to
 open, read, or write to inappropriate devices. Here is an example that was
 reported:     <NOTOPEN>C1+3^ORPR03
  
 It has been determined that this issue occurs in several ways listed below:
  
  1) Because both FileMan and the Device Manager provide similar 'spacebar
     return' functionality and both store the last device selected at the
     same location in the ^DISV( global.  This patch resolves the issue
     by changing where the Device Manager stores the last device selected.
     By having FileMan and Device Manager store the last device selected
     in different locations, Device Manager will stop selecting inappropriate
     devices via 'spacebar return'.
   
  2) The Device Manager API ^%ZIS may be called non-interactively by
     by applications such as CPRS in order to open a known device. That
     is done by setting the input variable IOP to the device that is to
     be used.  Before this patch, that would result in the value of the
     'last device selected' to be modified, even though it was the 
     application that selected the device, for example,  via a
     configuration file, rather than the user selecting the device at
     the device prompt. This patch modifies the Device Manager so that
     such non-interactive selection of a device will NOT cause the user's
    'last device selected' to be modified. 
  
  3) Similar to 2) above, the Device Manager's internal APIs NOQ^%ZISUTL 
     and FIND^%ZISUTL are called non-interactively and result in the user's
     'last device selected' being modified. These API's are used by TaskMan,
     and prior to this patch calling Taskman non-interactively with a device
     specified could result in the user's 'last device selected' being
     modified.  For example, calling ^%ZTLOAD to queue a task with the input
     parameter ZTIO set to the name of a RESOURCE DEVICE would result in
     the user's 'last device selected' being set to the RESOURCE DEVICE. This
     patch corrects that.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 HD0000000063152   Subject: Default Device Prompt
  
 Problem:
 -------
 This is the description that appeared in the Remedy Ticket:
 It appears that we may be using ^DISV(+DUZ,"^%ZIS(1," for more then the  
 last device. Users coming out of CPRS GUI and using spacebar return in  
 Mailman, or other LM Packages, are starting to see some device names that  
 look pretty wild to them, such as Notification Management or CPRS GUI  
 Background Data. We need to consider storing those variables somewhere
 else.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
  
 Device lookups can be accomplished via both FileMan and the Device 
 Manager.  They both offer the 'spacebar return' functionality, and they
 both currently store the last device selected in the same location.   
 Thus, users of functionality that make use of FileMan to select a device
 may inadvertently overwrite the last device selected for printing via the
 Device Manager.  The solution is that FileMan and the Device Manager store
 the last device selected in different locations, which this patch
 accomplishes.

 Patch Installation Overview:
 ===========================
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
  
 This patch cannot be queued.  
  
 Place TaskMan in a wait state. (DO WAIT^ZTMKU)
  
 Inhibit users from login into the system. (If you install when a few
 users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is
 acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
  
 This patch may be installed with users on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 5 
 minutes to install.
  
 There are no options that need be disabled.
  
 Post Installation Overview
 --------------------------
  
 The Post-Installation moves the routines ^ZIS1 and ^ZIS5 into the manager 
 account and deletes post installation routine after the installation. 
  
 Installation:
 =============
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter: XU*8*572
  
     a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
     c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
         Enter YES/NO to the Inhibit Logons question based on 
         Pre-installation instructions.
  
      Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO// YES 
      Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 5.  Remove TaskMan from wait state.  (DO RUN^ZTMKU)
