Subject: IPv4 and IPv6 Utilities

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch includes new utilities to support the VA's transition from IPv4
 to IPv6.  IPv6 is a protocol designed to handle the growth rate of the 
 Internet and to cope with the demanding requirements of services, 
 mobility, and end-to-end security.  A Federal Chief Information Office 
 (CIO) memo "Transition to IPv6" released in September of 2010 requires
 agencies to continue their IPv6 transition efforts and has established
 specific milestones associated with enabling an IPv6 operational
 capability by the end of FY2014.
  
 These utilities will be supported under Integration Agreement (IA) #5844.
  
 $$VALIDATE^XLFIPV(IP) will validate the format of an IP address (either 
 IPv4 or IPv6) and return 0 if the address is in an invalid format, or 
 return 1 if the format is correct.  It can be called from routines or 
 from FileMan data dictionaries wherever an IP address format needs to be
 checked.
  
 $$FORCEIP4^XLFIPV(IP) will take an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and
 return an IPv4 address in a standardized format. This function can be used
 for existing data dictionary input transforms to store IP addresses in a
 consistent manner.  The function will return the null address "0.0.0.0" if
 the passed IP address is invalid.  If an IPv6 address is input which does
 not have a valid IPv4 equivalent, then the null address "0.0.0.0" will
 be returned.
  
 $$FORCEIP6^XLFIPV(IP) will take an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and
 return an IPv6 address in a standardized format. This function can be used
 for database conversions after a transition to IPv6 or for data dictionary
 input transforms to store IP addresses in a consistent manner.  The
 function will return the null address "::0" if the passed IP address is
 invalid.
  
 $$CONVERT^XLFIPV(IP) will take an IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6) and 
 return an IPv4 address if the Cache settings have IPv6 disabled, or will 
 return an IPv6 address if the Cache settings have IPv6 enabled.  It will 
 return the null address "0.0.0.0" or "::0" if the passed IP address is
 invalid or cannot be converted.
  
 $$VERSION^XLFIPV() will return 1 if IPv6 is enabled in Cache, or will 
 return 0 if IPv6 is disabled.  Beginning with version 2009.1, Cache 
 supports IPv6 if enabled under the console "Memory and Startup 
 Settings" and if the underlying operating system supports IPv6. This
 function will return 0 for any version of Cache less than 2009.1.
  
 Several menu options have been added to the OPTIONS file (#19) that use 
 the above functions.  These have been grouped together into the new "IPv4 
 and IPv6 Address Tools" [XLFIPV IPV4 IPV6 MENU] menu option and added to 
 the "Operations Management" [XUSITEMGR] menu option.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. INC0000000739035 Kernel Support for IPv6
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Currently, all of VA's internal and external infrastructure and 
 applications are set to IPv4 as the default transport mode.  The format 
 is different between IPv4 and IPv6.  Kernel and several other 
 applications process IP addresses in routines and need to store the IP 
 addresses in files.  Each of these fields will need to change their field 
 definition (data dictionary) to handle the longer IPv6 format.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch provides functions to validate and translate addresses in both 
 IPv4 and IPv6 format.  These supported functions may be called by other 
 applications or data dictionaries for the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 in 
 the VA network.
