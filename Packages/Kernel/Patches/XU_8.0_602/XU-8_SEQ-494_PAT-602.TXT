Subject: FIX ALERT SURROGATE SETTINGS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Problems fixed in this patch include: 
  
   1.  If a surrogate is set for alerts using a START TIME of "NOW", and
 then a second surrogate for a later time is added, the first entry (the
 current surrogate setting) was removed.  After this patch is installed,
 the current surrogate setting will only be removed if a replacement
 surrogate is entered that also begins with a start time of "NOW", making
 it the new current surrogate setting.
  
   2.  The prompts when setting a surrogate in VistA have been changed.  
       a.  If no start date is entered, the start date will be entered as
           "NOW" and only new alerts will be forwarded.  A start or end
           date/time earlier than "NOW" is not permitted.  The user is
           prompted that if a date is entered, then a time is also
           required.
       b.  If a start date or end date is entered without the year, and 
           appending the current year will create a date in the past, then
           a FUTURE year will be appended to the date.
  
   3.  Patch XU*8*513 added logic to restrict surrogate loops from 
 forming.  In some cases, the logic was too restrictive and would not
 permit a valid (non looping) surrogacy to be set.  The logic will now look
 at the date/time when a surrogacy is scheduled to start or end when
 evaluating cyclical surrogates, and will permit a valid surrogacy to be
 set.
  
   4.  Mixed Operating System (Mixed-OS) VistA sites reported a problem
 with forwarding alerts to a printer when logged into a Linux node.  The
 "@CACHESYS0:PRINTQ: command not found" error that is generated indicates
 that the selected printer was not set up with QUEUING=FORCED, which is a
 requirement on Mixed-OS VistA systems.  The alerts software by default
 would try to print directly (without queuing) to the printer.  The default
 has now been changed to force queued printing.
  
   5.  The description for patch XU*8*513 states that when viewing alerts
 in VistA, critical alerts will move to the top of the list.  They did not.
 Now they do.
  
   6.  On rare occasions, a user received hundreds of mail message 
 notifications of surrogate release.  This should no longer happen.
  
   7.  The prompts for the "Surrogate for which users?" [XQAL SURROGATE 
 FOR WHICH USERS] menu option have been clarified.

 1. HD0000000063299 MOU-0502-31390-ALERTS Surrogate Problems
  
 Problem:
 -------
 While troubleshooting problems with surrogate settings (which have been 
 corrected since this ticket was entered), it was suggested that the 
 prompts be clarified for the "Surrogate for which users?" [XQAL SURROGATE 
 FOR WHICH USERS] menu option to avoid confusion.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The prompt has been changed from Select User (NEW PERSON entry) to Select 
 Surrogate (NEW PERSON entry), as suggested.
  
 2. HD0000000289575 XQALERT SURROGATE SET/REMOVE
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The option "Alerts - Set/Remove Surrogate for User" [XQALERT SURROGATE 
 SET/REMOVE] asks for the date/time a surrogate should be removed.  The 
 time is NOT required.  If the user does not enter a time it defaults to 
 midnight of the previous date leaving the door open for the surrogate not 
 to receive critical warnings for the last day entered.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The prompts when setting a surrogate have been changed.  Date/time 
 settings earlier than "NOW" are not permitted.  If a date, but no time, is
 entered, the entry will not be accepted and the user will be prompted to
 include a time.  This will implement step 1 of the permanent solution 
 recommended for Patient Safety Issue #1225.  [PSPO #1225]
  
 3. HD0000000371545 Unable to see surrogate under the Alerts - Set/Remove 
 Surrogate for User option
  
 Problem:
 -------
 While setting a surrogate, the user specified an end date earlier than 
 the start date and the surrogacy was not visible under the "Alerts - 
 Set/Remove Surrogate for User" [XQALERT SURROGATE SET/REMOVE] menu 
 option.  The user specified a start date of DEC 28 and an end date of JAN 
 03, and VistA appended the same year to both dates.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The alerts software has been modified to only allow date/time settings 
 "NOW" and into the future when setting surrogates in VistA. If the year is
 omitted from the date, VistA will append a year for a date in the future.
  
 4. HD0000000429160 Forwarding an alert to PRINT COPY returns error 
 (duplicate HD0000000470998)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Forwarding an Alert to PRINT COPY returns "@CACHESYS0:PRINTQ: command not
 found".  This only happens when the user is logged in to a Linux
 application server.  Subroutine FORWARD^XQALFWD (Integration Agreement
 #3009) does not force print queuing if the Linux system is set up
 incorrectly.  This also affects CPRS users if notifications are set to be
 printed, and the printer has not been set to QUEUING=FORCED.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Subroutine FORWARD^XQALFWD was modified to force print queuing by default.
  
 5. HD0000000499802 Repeating notification of Surrogate release
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A nurse released her surrogate resulting in the released individual 
 getting repeated emails concerning this release.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This is due to old entries in the ALERTS file (#8992) SURROGATE multiple 
 fields. In the past, Remedy tickets for this issue have been resolved by 
 cleaning out historical entries that were no longer needed for processing 
 of alerts. Expired surrogate entries will now be removed automatically 
 from the file after all alert processing for those surrogacies has been 
 completed.
  
 6. HD0000000707587 Multiple surrogates problem in settings after XU*8*513 
 (duplicates HD0000000713880, HD0000000723243, HD0000000726019, 
 HD0000000748726, HD0000000768068)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 There is a problem with using a START TIME of "NOW" (or blank, which
 defaults to "NOW") for setting a surrogate, and then entering a 
 second surrogate entered in succession after the first.  When the second 
 surrogate is entered, the first entry (the current surrogate setting) 
 is deleted.  This happens any time that there is a current (active) 
 surrogate setting and a future setting is added.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Routine ^XQALSURO has been modified to only remove the current surrogate 
 setting if a replacement setting is entered that also begins with a start 
 time of "NOW" (or blank, which defaults to "NOW"), making it the new
 current surrogate setting.
  
 7. HD0000000733753 Can't set surrogate
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Dr. A is on leave and Dr. B is her surrogate.  Dr. B is going on leave 
 next week and Dr. A will be back and will be surrogate for Dr. B.  Using 
 option "Alerts - Set/Remove Surrogate for User" [XQALERT SURROGATE 
 SET/REMOVE] won't allow us to put in the surrogate for next week.  VistA 
 returns message "YOU are designated as the surrogate for this user (####) 
 - can't do it!"
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The check for a cyclical surrogate has been moved from the start of the 
 process (when surrogate start and end date/times are not yet available) 
 to the end of the process, so the above scenario can now be entered in 
 VistA without error.
