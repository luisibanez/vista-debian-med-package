Subject: Consolidated Information Regarding XU*8*546 Release

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Several issues have been reported with the release of Kernel Patch 
 XU*8*546 regarding device setup. For your convenience, the Legacy VistA
 Infrastructure team has consolidated ALL of the information related to
 Kernel Patches XU*8*546 and XU*8*556 into one location.
  
 A. QUEUING Field:
  
 Devices with the name of NULL or HFS must NOT have their QUEUING field 
 (#5.5) set to "FORCED" in the DEVICE file (#3.5).  You can set the QUEUING
 field to ALLOWED.
  
 NOTE: Class 3 routines that are not written to permit queuing will no 
 longer output to devices where the QUEUING field is set to FORCED.  Sites
 that have completed the Linux upgrade checklist, should have already
 addressed this issue.
  
 B. Access to Accounts:
  
 Some sites, while installing patch XU*8*546 in test accounts, have had 
 problems with access to the accounts after the installation.
  
 There are two simple things to check in order to avoid any problems:
  
 1.  There are 3 fields in the DEVICE file (# 3.5) to check before 
 installing Patch XU*8*546:
     
     * Make sure that the SIGN-ON/SYSTEM DEVICE field (#1.95) is set to "YES" 
 for devices OPA, RTA, TNA, & FTA.
     
     * Devices with the name of NULL or HFS must NOT have their QUEUING 
 field (#5.5) set to "FORCED" in the DEVICE file (#3.5).  You can set the
 QUEUING field to ALLOWED (as stated in paragraph A).
  
     * Make sure that no device has the TYPE field (#2) set to "HG". The 
 environment check should have caused you to address this issue. After the 
 installation of Patch XU*8*546, devices of TYPE "HG" cannot be selected.
  
 2.  Once the install is complete, before terminating the session that 
 installs Patch XU*8.0*546 do the following:
     
     * Confirm that roll & scroll users still have access to VistA.
     
     * Confirm that CPRS users can log into VistA.
  
  
 The following is Description from Patch XU*8*546:
  
 On a mixed OS system, when the user enters the name of an HFS path/file 
 and the output is queued. The task fails because the path/file was checked
 when entered and it is fixed for the current system. The fix was to not
 check the path/file until run time.
  
 The PRINT SIGN-ON LOG [XUSC LIST] option will print negative numbers 
 if there is not a sign-off time.
 Fix: Change the computed field ELAPSED TIME (MINUTES) (#99) to show "on line"
 if there is not a sign-off value.
  
 The Windows HFS path check did not account for the server syntax
 of "\\server\folder\file".
 Fixed to allow this syntax.
  
  
 Two parts to this ticket,
 1. The device handler did not enforce the "FORCED QUEUING" flag if the 
 application did not pass in that it was setup to allow queuing (pass in 
 %ZIS containing a "Q").
                              *****
 NOTE: Class 3 routines that are not written to permit queuing will no
 longer output to devices where the QUEUING field is set to FORCED.  Sites
 that have completed the Linux upgrade checklist, should have already
 addressed this issue.  
                              *****
 2. There is no code to supply a SPOOL file name under Linux.
  
 Support for Device Hunt Groups has been removed.
 This is the DEVICE file (#3.5) fields *HUNT GROUP (#29) and HUNT GROUP 
 DEVICE (#30).
 This means that you must remove any HUNT GROUP devices before you install
 this patch. Use FileMan to find if you have any.

 OS print queues make the need for hunt groups obsolete.
