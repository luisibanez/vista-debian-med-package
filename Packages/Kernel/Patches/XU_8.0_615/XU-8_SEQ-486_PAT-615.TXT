Subject: INFORMATIONAL - XU*8.0*585

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 Patch XU*8.0*585 adds PRINT QUEUE, code PQ, to the TYPE field (#2) of the
 DEVICE file (#3.5).   This patch provides additional instructions regarding
 the installation of patch XU*8.0*585 and the use of the PRINT QUEUE device
 type.  Currently, there is a hold on XU*8.0*585 which is being lifted
 simultaneously with the release of informational patch XU*8.0*615.  
 
 1)  The use of the new PRINT QUEUE type is NOT mandatory.  Print queues may
     still be used via HFS devices which call the NVSPRTU routine.  
 
 2)  The conversion utility CNVRT^XU8P585 should NOT be used.  Instead,
     devices may optionally be converted on a cases-by-case basis.  See the
     considerations  listed in 5) below.
 
 3)  The pre-installation steps for patch XU*8.0*585 instruct sites to create
     the print_queues subdirectory.  Please keep in mind these additional
     points:
 
   a)  Applications staff at local sites may not have access to create the
       required subdirectories.  Creation of directories for this patch
       should be handled according to regional policies and procedures in
       the same way that directory creation has been done in the past.
   b)  On Linux systems, the standard for directories should be followed. 
       Following that standard, the new subdirectory would be:
               /srv/vista/<scd>/user/hfs/print_queues
   c)  The instructions for creating the new print_queues subdirectory must
       be implemented on every Linux node of the system. 
 
 4)  The new XU PURGE PRINT QUEUE HFS FILES option [PURGE PRINT QUEUE HOST
     FILES] is scheduled automatically by the post-installation routine of
     XU*8.0*585.  The option deletes 'old' interim host files created as the
     result of using the PRINT QUEUE device type where the queued job fails
     to print within 24 hours.  The host files are always automatically
     deleted once the file is printed, but if printing fails to occur, then
     the host files may hang around for a prolonged period and may pose a
     privacy or security concern.  The issue has been raised that for some
     print jobs, for example, batches of labels, it is NOT acceptable to
     delete the host file in the event that it fails to print.  If that is
     the case, there are these two alternatives: 
 
   a)  A site may un-schedule the XU PURGE PRINT QUEUE HFS FILES option [PURGE
       PRINT QUEUE HOST FILES].  If that is done, it would be up to the
       site to periodically purge old, unneeded host files from the
       print_queues directory.
   b)  Alternatively, sites may choose NOT to use the new PRINT QUEUE device
       type for certain devices, such as label printers. 
 
 5)  These considerations apply to the use of the new PRINT QUEUE device type:
 
   a)  PRINT QUEUE devices do NOT allow the site to specify the OPEN parameters
       to use.  Although it is not usually necessary to specify special OPEN
       parameters, that may not always be the case.  In particular, there may
       be label printers that require the use of the UNDEFINED open parameter,
       as in "NWU".  For such printers, do NOT use the PRINT QUEUE device type.  
   b)  A printer that currently uses the HFS type for print queues may be
       converted to the new PRINT QUEUE device type by using Fileman to change
       the TYPE field (#2) of the DEVICE file (#3.5) to PQ.   No other changes
       are needed.  Each device that is converted should be tested. 
   c)  The currently released version of the NVSMKPRN utilities are not
       compatible with the PRINT QUEUE device type.  If the NVSMKPRN utilities
       are used to edit a PRINT QUEUE type of device, the device type will
       automatically change to HFS.  A new version of the NVSMKPRN utilities
       that does support the PRINT QUEUE device type will be released in the
       near future.
