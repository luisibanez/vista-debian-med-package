Subject: MENU MANAGER FIXES AND ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 VistA Kernel patch XU*8*614 provides the following fixes and enhancements:
  
 1.  When entering VistA from programmer mode using D ^XUP the last command
 <spacebar> recall did not work.  Instead, it ran the "User start-up 
 event" [XU USER START-UP] menu option.  After this patch is installed, 
 entering VistA from programmer mode will access the menu option selected 
 on the previous use of D ^XUP using the <spacebar> recall (Unwinder) 
 feature.
  
 2.  The menu option "Single User Menu Tree Rebuild" [XQBUILDUSER] is 
 provided in this patch.  It gives sites the means to rebuild the menu 
 trees for a single user.  It has been attached to the "Menu Rebuild
 Menu" [XQBUILDMAIN] option.
  
 3.  The parameter "XQ MENUMANAGER PROMPT" is provided in this patch.  It 
 allows sites to change the default <TEST ACCOUNT> prompt to another value
 such as <LEGACY SYSTEM> in menu prompts of non-production VistA systems.  
 The text defined by this parameter is inserted in the MenuManager
 prompts.  If no text is defined, the hard-coded default is " <TEST
 ACCOUNT>".  Alternatives could be " <LEGACY SYSTEM>", " <CONTINGENCY>", "
 <READ ONLY>" or any other value from 3 to 20 characters, depending upon
 the purpose of the non-production VistA system.  To change the value on a 
 non-production system, use the "General Parameter Tools" [XPAR MENU 
 TOOLS] option and select "EP Edit Parameter Values".  You will have to 
 log off and log back into VistA to see the changed menu prompt.  Note that
 the prompt can be set in advance on a production system before it is
 mirrored to a non-production system, and the prompt will only appear on
 the non-production system.
  
 4.  A new menu option, "List Unreferenced Menu Options" [XQ LIST 
 UNREFERENCED OPTIONS], is provided in this patch.  The option runs a 
 report listing entries in the OPTION file (#19) that are not assigned to 
 any user or attached to any other menu option.  It does not include 
 options that are assigned in TaskManager (TaskMan) or have the "KEEP FROM 
 DELETING" field (#209.2) set to "yes".
  
 5.  The "KEEP FROM DELETING" field (#209.2) has been set to "yes" on
 option "User start-up event" [XU USER START-UP] in the OPTION file (#19).

 Options Associated:
  
 Option Name                    Type                New/Modified/Deleted
 -----------                    ----                --------------------
 "Single User Menu Tree Rebuild"
 [XQBUILDUSER]                  R:run routine       New
 This option collects the menus that a user has in the primary and 
 secondary fields of the OPTION file (#19) and then rebuilds the menu 
 tree.  Note that other users might have the same menu tree, but this will 
 only rebuild the menu tree for the selected user.
  
 "Menu Rebuild Menu"
 [XQBUILDMAIN]                  M:menu              Modified
 This is the main menu for all menu rebuild options.
  
 "List Unreferenced Menu Options"
 [XQ LIST UNREFERENCED OPTIONS] R:run routine       New
 List unreferenced options from OPTION file (#19).
  
 "Display Menus and Options"
 [XQDISPLAY OPTIONS]            M:menu              Modified
 This is a menu of options that will help the user display menus and their 
 options.
  
 "User start-up event"
 [XU USER START-UP]             X:extended action   Modified
 This is an option used exclusively during a VistA user sign-on event. 
 Items listed in this option are "TYPE:action" options in the OPTION file
 (#19) that can be used to prompt users for input upon VistA sign-on and
 before their Primary Menu Option is displayed.  It will not be used for
 GUI sign-on.  It is called from XQ12.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  INC000000064420    MAD-1104-41204 No access to Imaging
  INC000000764449    Last command recall no longer works
  INC000000767421    Menu site identification for Legacy systems
  
 1. INC000000064420 No access to Imaging
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Occasionally a user has a menu option assigned in VistA, but still does 
 not have access to the option. An existing option to "Build Primary Menu 
 Trees" [XQBUILDTREE] fixes the problem by rebuilding the menu trees for
 all users, but is impractical for fixing a problem for a single user. A
 menu rebuild for a single user would be a more practical solution.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 New option "Single User Menu Tree Rebuild" [XQBUILDUSER] was created to 
 rebuild the menus for a single user.
  
 2. INC000000764449 Last command recall no longer works
  
 Problem:
 -------
 After installation of XU*8.0*593 when entering VistA from programmer mode
 using D ^XUP the last command <spacebar> recall no longer works.  Instead,
 it runs the "User start-up event" [XU USER START-UP] menu option.  At all
 other levels of the Menu Manager, using the <spacebar> to recall the last
 used menu option still works.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The intrinsic function $$STARTUP^XQ12 was modified to save the Kernel 
 Unwinder value for the OPTION file (#19) and restore it after the "User 
 start-up event" [XU USER START-UP] menu option was run.
  
 3. INC000000767421 Menu site identification for Legacy systems
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Integrated sites that were formerly stand-alone production sites may have 
 a Legacy VistA system containing historical data entered prior to site 
 integration.  After patch XU*8*593, these sites show <TEST ACCOUNT> in 
 the menu prompts.  The <TEST ACCOUNT> prompt was added in XU*8*593 to 
 identify a non-production system, but does not adequately describe a 
 legacy system.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Created a parameter "XQ MENUMANAGER PROMPT" that allows sites to change
 the default <TEST ACCOUNT> prompt to another value such as <LEGACY SYSTEM>
 in the menu prompt on non-production systems.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch can be queued for installation.  TaskMan does not have to be 
 stopped, HL7 filers do not need to be stopped, and users may be on the 
 system.  There are no menu options or protocols that need to be 
 disabled.  The patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize
 potential for disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 1 
 minute to install, and may be queued for installation.
  
 Note that when installing this patch in a non-production VistA account, 
 you will have to log off and log back on to see the " <TEST ACCOUNT>" 
 prompt.
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     XU*8.0*614):
  
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.  NOTE:  When installed in a TEST environment, 
         your BEFORE checksums might not match the values shown below if
         any of the routines were modified to display <TEST ACCOUNT> in
         the VistA menu prompts.  The checksums should match in a
         production environment.
