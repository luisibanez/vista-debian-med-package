                                 XU*8*587
  
 This patch addresses a problem for the option "Single File add/delete for
 a user" [XUFILESINGLEADD]. This option does not allow the updating of an
 active user's files if the user has a future termination date entered.
  
 To fix the problem, the field DIC(S) (#34) of the option has been updated
 with the supported $$ACTIVE^XUSER API to check if a selected user is
 active.
  
 The option after patch will look like:
  
 NAME: XUFILESINGLEADD
   MENU TEXT: Single file add/delete for a user
   TYPE: edit                            CREATOR: USER NAME
   X ACTION PRESENT: YES
  DESCRIPTION:   This option is used to add or delete the access a user 
                 has for a single file.
   EXIT ACTION: K V,W,C,DI,DISYS,DQ,%X,%Y,DLAYGO
   DIC {DIC}: VA(200,                    DIC(0): AEMQ
   DIC(S): I $P($$ACTIVE^XUSER(+Y),"^",2)'="",
             $P($$ACTIVE^XUSER(+Y),"^",2)'="TERMINATED"
   DIE: VA(200,
   DR {DIE}: [XUFILESINGLE]
   UPPERCASE MENU TEXT: SINGLE FILE ADD/DELETE FOR A U
