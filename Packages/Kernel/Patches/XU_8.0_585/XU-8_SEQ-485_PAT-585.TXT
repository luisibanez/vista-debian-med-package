Subject: Linux Print Queues

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch adds the PRINT QUEUE device type to the Device file (#3.5).  
 PRINT QUEUE devices will work only on Linux or VMS systems, and will not
 work on Windows systems, which use a different approach to providing print
 queues. 
  
 Remedy Ticket: None

 Overview
 ========
 Print queue devices make use of the print queue functionality provided by 
 the underlying OS.  When a VistA user selects a print queue device at the
 device prompt, a host file is created and the application's output is
 directed to the host file.  When the application calls the Kernel Device
 Manager to close the device, the Device Manager closes the host file and
 calls the OS to print the file, which causes a print job to be queued.  
 The OS is responsible for insuring that the queued print job is actually
 printed, and the host file is automatically deleted once printing is
 completed.
  
 Using a Print Queue Device
 ==========================
 VistA users use the new PRINT QUEUE devices simply by selecting a PRINT QUEUE
 device at the device prompt.  
  
 Configuring a Print Queue Device
 ================================
 The new XUDEVEDITPQ [Print Queue Edit] option has been added to the 
 XUDEVEDIT [Device Edit] menu for configuring Print Queue devices. In order
 to use a Print Queue device, there must be a print queue configured on the
 host OS.  Instructions for doing that are outside of the scope of this
 document. The name of the print queue, as configured within the OS, is
 used as the value for the $I field (#1) of the device.
  
  
 Converting HFS Devices that use ^NVSPRTU to PRINT QUEUE Devices (Optional)
 ==========================================================================
 Currently sites utilize the print queue services provided by the OS 
 through the use of the ^NVSPRTU routine distributed by National VistA
 Support (NVS).  The devices that use the NVS solution for print queues are
 HFS type devices, and their OPEN EXECUTE and CLOSE EXECUTE logic call the
 ^NVSPRTU routine.   The name of the print queue, as configured in the OS,
 is located in the $I field (#1) of the device.  Those device entries may
 be converted to the new PRINT QUEUE type by using the CNVRT^XU8P585 API. 
 Instructions are in the POST-INSTALLATION section of the patch
 installation instructions. 
  
 The conversion process is simple, and requires just changing the device 
 type from HFS to PQ.  However, it should be noted that the Device Manger
 will treat several of the device's fields differently:
  
  a) Calls to the routine ^NVSPRTU by the OPEN EXECUTE, CLOSE EXECUTE, and
     PRE-OPEN EXECUTE logic will be ignored.
  b) These device fields will be totally ignored:  ASK PARAMETERS field
     (#5), ASK HOST FILE field (#5.1),  ASK HFS I/O OPERATION  field (#5.2),
     OPEN PARAMETERS field (#15). 
  
  
 New and Modified Files
 =====================
  
 DEVICE file (#3.5) (Modified)
 ============================
  
 TYPE field (#2) - The code PQ for PRINT QUEUE has been added to the set of
 codes.
  
 PURGE OLD PRINT QUEUE FILES field (#.13) has been added. Normally host 
 files placed on a print queue are automatically purged after 24 hours even
 if printing has not occurred.  However, sites may set this field to NO to
 suspend purging for host files created via that particular device.  Doing
 so should only be done for short periods while troubleshooting issues
 involving print queues.
  
 PRINT QUEUE JOBS file (#3.52)(New)
 ==================================
 This new file tracks the host files and print jobs that are passed to the OS
 for printing.  Entries in this file are automatically created when a PRINT
 QUEUE device is opened.  Entries are purged after 48 hours.  
  
  
 New and Modified Options
 ========================
  
 XUDEVEDIT menu option [Device Edit] (modified)
 ===================================
 This menu now includes the new XUDEVEDITPQ option [XUDEVEDITPQ].
  
 XUDEVEDITPQ option [XUDEVEDITPQ] (new)
 ================================
 This is a new option for creating or editing entries in the DEVICE file 
 (#3.5) of the new PRINT QUEUE type.
  
 XU PURGE PRINT QUEUE HFS FILES option [PURGE PRINT QUEUE HOST FILES] (new)
 ====================================================================
 The purpose of this new option is to purge the file PRINT QUEUE JOBS 
 (#3.52) of old entries.  Entries are purged after 24 hours.  The option
 also purges host files that still exist after 24 hours.  Normally, host
 files should be printed and deleted long before then.
  
 Patch Installation Instructions
 ===============================
  
 Pre-Installation Steps
  
 1) Create the print_queues sub-directory under the directory used by the
    Kernel Device Manager for HFS files.  The HFS directory is shown in the
    KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS  file (#8989.3), in the PRIMARY HFS DIRECTORY
    field (#320).
   
  **  NOTE: **  Create the new sub-directory print-queues in ** lowercase **
  letters.  Linux systems DO distinguish between lowercase and uppercase,
  though VMS systems do not.    
  
 2) Set the group permissions for the new sub-directory to allow the
    creation, writing, reading, and deleting of files.
  
 VMS Example:
   Suppose the directory used for host files is USER$:[TEMP].  Then enter 
   these commands at the VMS command prompt:
  
      CREATE/DIRECTORY USER$:[TEMP.print_queues]
      set protection=(g:rwed) USER$:[TEMP]print_queues.DIR
      
  
  
 Linux Example:
   Suppose the directory used for host files is /var/tmp/.  Then enter these
   commands at the Linux command prompt:
  
          mkdir /var/tmp/print_queues
          chmod g=rwx /var/tmp/print_queues
  
  
 3) Sites that operate in a mixed OS environment, with both VMS and Linux
    systems, must repeat steps 1) and 2) to create a sub-directory 
    print_queues on the secondary system, located in the directory shown in
    the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3), in the SECONDARY HFS
    DIRECTORY field (#320.2).
  
 Installation Steps
 ==================
  
   1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  It is
      recommended that the installation be queued during off-peak hours. The
      installation could take up to 2 minutes
  
   2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
   3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
      option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   4. This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
      The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
      the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
      options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you may be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <XU*8.0*585>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
   
   6. Verify that the install completed.   No further steps are needed. 
  
   7. The post-install routine ^XU8P585 should not be deleted.  It can be
      run again without causing harm.
  
  
 Post-Installation Steps
 =======================
  
 1) The post-installation routine should automatically have scheduled the
    option XU PURGE PRINT QUEUE HFS FILES option [PURGE PRINT QUEUE HOST
    FILES] to run hourly on Linux and VMS systems, but not Windows.
    In addition, if your site runs under both VMS and Linux, the option 
    should also be scheduled to run on the Linux system.  HFS files created
    on the VMS system are not accessible from the Linux system and vice
    versa.
  
 2) VMS and Linux sites should convert their existing HFS devices that
    call the ^NVSPRTU routine to the new PRINT QUEUE type devices.  To
    do the conversion, enter at the MUMPS programmer prompt:
  
 >   DO CNVRT^XU8P585
  
  
    The conversion should take less than one minute. A list of all devices
    that are converted is created in the global array: ^XTMP("%ZIS HFS TO
    PQ")
  
    The conversion can be reversed by entering at the MUMPS programmer 
    prompt:
  
    >DO UNDO^XU8P585
