 This kernel patch fixes a problem while placing time and date 
 restriction for an Option. OPTION file (#19), field TIMES/DAYS 
 PROHIBITED (#3.19). If a restriction is placed for an option now, it work
 correctly if we paddle through the menus. However if we execute an ^ jump,
 they all are ignored and users can access the options freely.
