Subject: LENGTHEN TIME FOR TOKEN SIGNON

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Some Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications, such as Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS), launch another application and, so that the
 user does not have to re-authenticate for the new application, it requests
 a sign-on token from the VistA server, provides the new application with
 this token on the command line and the new application uses this to
 authenticate the current user.  This sign-on token is only good for a
 limited time (prior to this patch the period was 20 seconds).  However,
 there have been instances where due to slower networks, the token expires
 prior to authenticating the user.
  
 This patch contains 1 routine (XUSRB4) and (other than adding the patch 
 number on the second line) has only one change - the default value for 
 the token expiration is changed from 20 seconds to 90 seconds.

 Blood Bank Clearance:
 =====================
 Clearance Date: 8/25/2011
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*573 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of VISTA
 Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does not
 alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or safety
 critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*573 have no effect on Blood Bank
 software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
  
 Caution: the routine XUSRB4, which is modified in this patch, is 
 called in various instances which set up or use a token for
 authentication.  These include, but may not be limited to, tokens
 for the Broker Security Enhancement, Clinical Context Object 
 Workgroup (CCOW) User Context, and tokens for an auto sign-on
 process.  If this routine is modified (by installing this patch
 while a user is involved in one of these processes), it may
 result in an "EDITED" error which could end the user's session.  
 This can be prevented completely by only installing with no users
 on the system.  Otherwise there should be minimal users on the
 system during the installation and they should be requested to
 refrain from launching applications which may use a silent
 sign-on (e.g., an application from within CPRS, or an application
 which will make another sign-on with CCOW User Context, etc.)
 around the time period that the installation is scheduled.
       
 1.   Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation.
  
 2.   Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
 option will load the KIDS (Kernel Installation and Distribution System)
 package onto your system.
  
 3.   You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
 4.   The patch has now been loaded into a transport global on your
 system.  On the KIDS menu, select the 'Installation' menu and use the
 following options:
  
    Verify Checksums in Transport Global
    Print Transport Global
    Compare Transport Global to Current System
    Backup a Transport Global
  
 5. Installation of the patch will take less than one minute.
        Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*573'
                             ==========
    Accept the following defaults.
  
    Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  
    Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
