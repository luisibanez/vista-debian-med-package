Subject: VRAM ENTRY IN REMOTE APPLICATION FILE

Category: 
  - Other
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The VistA Remote Access Management (VRAM) Graphical User Interface (GUI)
 is being developed as a client application interface to both the Claims
 System and remote VistA systems.  Features covered within the scope of the
 application include:
  -  Connection and authentication with the Claims System through use of
     authorized user credentials
  -  Obtaining the authorized user's Claims System National-Level Account
     Profile
  -  Display and selection of authorized access to remote VistA systems
     (user's catalog of authorized sites)
  -  Connectivity to and brokered authentication with selected authorized
     remote VistA systems using RPC Broker BSE component
  -  Support for connectivity to remote VistA systems using SSH or Telnet
     (favoring SSH).
  -  Establishing a Terminal Emulation (VT-100) interface between the user
     and the selected remote VistA system  
  -  Provide standard Terminal Emulation and key mapping features during
     the connected session
  -  Provide standard rich-client Microsoft Windows application features
  -  Perform Claims System National-Level Account Profile synchronization 
     during instantiation of the remote connection with the selected remote
     VistA system for specific users that includes:
      * Creation of accounts and/or synchronization of account credentials
      * Synchronization of Primary and Secondary Menu Option assignments
      * Synchronization of Security Keys
      * Synchronization of account preferences 
  -  Allow capture and printing of Terminal Emulation session conducted. 
  -  Allow launching multiple instances of the VRAM application.
  -  Provide capability of Terminal Emulation preferences for output (e.g. 
     background color, font color/size)
  -  Provide an executable self-extracting installation package to 
     automate installation of the VRAM client application and ancillary 
     components  
  
 Patch XU*8.0*629 will add an entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file 
 (#8994.5) for the VRAM application. The entry in this file will allow the
 Kernel Broker code in the host VistA system to validate VRAM
 authentication requests for remote user access, and is done in accordance
 with instructions on the use of the Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) as
 provided by the Kernel team.
     
 By using BSE, VRAM can discontinue use of the CAPRI style of 
 authentication, which is scheduled to be disabled at a future date. The 
 file entry contains the name of the application, the application code 
 (hashed), method of authentication, and authentication server IP, port, 
 and entry point.  
  
 The menu option "CPAC VRAM GUI" [KPA VRAM GUI] in OPTION file (#19) 
 contains the Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for the VRAM application, 
 which was installed by a KPA-namespaced patch. If the option does not
 exist on the VistA system where patch is XU*8*629 installed, an empty "KPA
 VRAM GUI" [KPA VRAM GUI] option will be created by this patch as a
 placeholder for the future installation of the VRAM application.

 Clearance - <04/16/13>
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*629 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or
 safety critical elements functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*629 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. INC000000819948 Kernel - Menu/Options Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Secondary menu options and security keys assigned during a VRAM session 
 are inaccessible to the user until the nightly menu rebuild occurs.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch includes a new Kernel Remote Procedure Call (RPC) "XU 
 REBUILD MENU TREE" which will rebuild the menu trees for a single user
 during the VRAM session.
  
 2. INC000000827587 Kernel - Security/Logon Issue
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Broker Security Enhancement (BSE) enables Remote Procedure Call (RPC) 
 based applications to make remote user/visitor connections in a more 
 secure manner.  BSE is used for users which require access to data 
 located at remote sites at which the users: (a) do not have assigned 
 Access/Verify codes, (b) have not been entered into the NEW PERSON file 
 (#200) by local staff, and (c) want to avoid having multiple 
 Access/Verify code pairs.  BSE is used to authenticate a valid VistA user 
 at one site (the home site) and subsequently access data and another site 
 (the remote site).  BSE is used by Compensation And Pension Records 
 Interchange (CAPRI), VistAWeb, Remote Data Views (RDV), VistA Imaging 
 Display Client, and other applications.  BSE adds a step to the signon 
 process to authenticate the connecting application.  This requires 
 passing a secret encoded phrase that will be authenticated on the remote 
 VistA system by looking up the entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file 
 (#8994.5).  The REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5) is updated by Kernel 
 patch and KIDS build.  VRAM requires an entry in this file to use BSE.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch will create an entry in the REMOTE APPLICATION file (#8994.5) 
 for the VRAM application.
