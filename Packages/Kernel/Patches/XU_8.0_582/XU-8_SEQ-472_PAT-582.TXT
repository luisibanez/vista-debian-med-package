         XU*8.0*582
  
 This Kernel patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1) The error trap routine ^%ZTER checks a count in the ERROR TRAP 
    SUMMARY file (#3.077) and stop recording errors once this limit has
    been reached. This limit was initialized to 10 in previous patch
    XU*8*431. However, some sites have reported that the current 10 error
    limit(per day) is too low. 
  
    This patch will increase the limit to 100 for sites that still
    have 10 as the default. However, if sites have already changed the
    default to any other number, this patch will not touch it.
  
    Sites can use FileMan to edit the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file
    (#8989.3) field ERROR LIMIT (#520.1). The sites can also, turn off the
    option and record unlimited errors by setting the field is NULL.
  
    For example:
  
    VA FileMan
  
    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS// 
    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 520.1  ERROR LIMIT
    THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
    Select KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS DOMAIN NAME:    
                                     KRN.FO-OAKLAND.MED.VA.GOV
    ERROR LIMIT: 100// @
         SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE? Y  (Yes)
  
 2) The MOST RECENT DATE/TIME field (#2) in the ERROR TRAP SUMMARY 
    file (#3.077) file wasn't updated with the last date/time an error 
    occurred. After this patch, the error trap routine will check and
    update the FIRST DATE/TIME field (#1), and MOST RECENT DATE/TIME field
    (#2).
  
 3) The description of Error trap Auto [XUERTRP AUTO CLEAN] is 
    updated to reflect the change on Error Limit functionality. The Error 
    Limit is defined on the KEEP ERROR TRAP field (#520.3) in the KERNEL 
    SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3).  The default is 7 if the field is
    blank.
  
    Before:
  
    DESCRIPTION:   This is a queueable option to clean up the error trap.  
    By default this option will clean-up any errors that were recorded 
    more than 7 days ago.  If in the Taskman Scheduling option the TASK 
    PARAMETERS field has another numeric value that will be used instead.  
  
    After:
  
    DESCRIPTION:   This is a queueable option to clean up the error trap. 
    This option will clean-up any errors that were recorded more than a 
    number of days ago. The number of days is defined on the KEEP ERROR
    TRAP field (#520.3) in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3). The
    default is 7 if the field is blank.
  
 4) When attempting to restore variables from an error, this message is 
    displayed:
    "MUST BE IN SAME UCI TO RESTORE PROGRAM --- VARIABLES RESTORED"
  
    This is actually harmless and the variables are restored anyway, but it
    is not necessary and confusing.
    After this patch, the message "VARIABLES RESTORED" is displayed.

  EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*582 contains 
  changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
  VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
  not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
  safety critical elements functions.
   
  RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*582 have no effect on Blood 
  Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
   
  Installation Instructions
  =========================
  
  1. Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the installation. 
     However, it is recommended that the patch be installed during
     non-peak time. It will take about two minutes to install the
     patch, but you may queue the installation if you wish.
   
  2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
   
  3. Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This      
     option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
   
  4. The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your system. 
     You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global. On the KIDS
     menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following options:
   
                  Verify Checksums in Transport Global
                  Print Transport Global
                  Compare Transport Global to Current System
                  Backup a Transport Global
   
     On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
     option:
                  Install Package(s)  
                  Select INSTALL NAME:XU*8.0*582
                                      ==========
  
   Accept the defaults for the following install questions:  
   Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? No//
   Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?  NO//
   Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
 The routine XU8P582 will be deleted after the installation completes.
 There is no after Checksum of the routine XU8P582.
