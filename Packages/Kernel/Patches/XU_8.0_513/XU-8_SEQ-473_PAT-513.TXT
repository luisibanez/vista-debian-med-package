Subject: Alert Fixes

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 1. This patch fixes problems where a user might be specified as a
 surrogate for someone who was currently or subsequently acting as
 surrogate for the same user.  In some cases, the setting of the surrogate
 might be rejected.  In other cases, the setting of the surrogate appeared
 to succeed, but it disappeared when checked, or if any other activity,
 such as an incoming alert, caused the relationship to be checked.  This
 patch corrects this problem.  The time period will be checked and the
 surrogate relationship added.  [Remedy Ticket HD0000000332819 and 
 duplicates.  PSPO #1776 and #1865.]
  
 2. This patch fixes instances where a surrogate relationship has ended,
 but unprocessed alerts are not returned to the user in a timely manner. 
 A check will be made for expiring surrogacy the first time a user logs 
 into VistA or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application, and
 unprocessed alerts will be returned immediately.  [Remedy Ticket 
 HD0000000070184 and duplicates.  PSPO #1862.]
  
 3. This patch fixes instances where the ALERT TRACKING file is not 
 updated to show the date/time an alert was viewed or processed.  In some 
 cases, when an alert is processed through a GUI, the ALERT TRACKING file 
 shows that the alert was deleted, but never viewed or processed.  The 
 ALERT TRACKING file will now be updated when an alert is processed 
 through a GUI.  [Remedy Ticket HD0000000069554 and duplicates.]
  
 4. Alerts which are indicated as critical are, at least in roll and 
 scroll mode, moved to the beginning of the list of alerts presented to 
 the user, and shown in reverse video [GUI applications determine how they 
 show the alerts].  However, it has required that a new Kernel patch be 
 released to add a new text to be identified as indicating a critical 
 alert.  There also was no checking for the word 'NOT' before the critical 
 text.  Patch XU*8*513 adds a new ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) which 
 can hold a string of text that will identify an alert that should be 
 identified as critical.  See file details below.  [Remedy Ticket 
 HD0000000254755.]

 =============================
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*513 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does 
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or 
 safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*513 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 The ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) was added to make it easier for 
 packages or Medical Centers to specify text that should be used to 
 indicate an alert to be marked as critical.  This file contains those text
 strings that were previously identified as indicating a critical alert and
 adds "Possible Malig" as text as well. In addition, this checking is not
 case sensitive, and if the identified string is immediately preceeded by a
 NOT it will not be indicated as sensitive.  Using this file means that the
 package or medical center can add desired text for identification without
 it having to be included in a Kernel patch.  It is also possible to
 require a specific identifier as part of a the package ID for the alert in
 conjunction with the critical text to limit the identified text to a
 specific package.

                                 alert.  If that field is non-null, an

                                 the PACKAGE-ID value is present in the
                                 ALERTID for the current alert.  This

                                 sensitive.  Also, if the critical text
                                 in the alert is preceded by the word
                                 'NOT', it will not be identified as a

                                 matching the PACKAGE-ID as a part of
                                 the ALERTID field.  Matching of this
                                 value will not be case sensitive.

 1. HD0000000069554    6 PAL-1101-69797 Data not displayed in notification 
 tracking (duplicates HD0000000070147, HD0000000070189, HD0000000287982, 
 HD0000000462716)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 GUI processing of alerts does not update the ALERT TRACKING (file 
 #8992.1) RECIPIENT (20) fields ALERT FIRST DISPLAYED (.02) and FIRST 
 SELECTED ALERT (.03).
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified GETUSER1^XQALDATA to update the alert tracking file when viewing 
 alerts in a RPC Broker call.
  
 2. HD0000000070184    6 PRE-0703-60448 Delay in Viewing Alert (duplicates 
 HD0000000070558, HD0000000532704)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Combination of problems.  ALERT TRACKING (file #8992.1) information may 
 be inaccurate (see #1 above). Also may be a problem with expiring 
 surrogacy. A VistA user's alerts would only be returned if (a) the user 
 manually checked for expired surrogates, or (b) a new alert is received 
 and surrogate relationships are checked automatically.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified DISPLAY^XQALERT to check surrogacy relationships and return 
 alerts from expired surrogates during a VistA user sign-on.  [Partial 
 resolution of PSPO #1862 for VistA sign-on.]
  
 3. HD0000000306313    6 A check to return previous surrogate alerts is 
 missing from a CPRS GUI call (duplicates HD0000000420820)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A check to return previous surrogate alerts is missing from a CPRS 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) Remote Procedure Call (RPC).   [Partial 
 resultion of PSPO #1862 for GUI sign-on.]
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified GETUSER1^XQALDATA to check surrogacy relationships and return 
 alerts from expired surrogates during a CPRS GUI user sign-on.
  
 4. HD0000000332810    Unable to get user to stay as surrogate 
 (duplicates HD0000000211528, HD0000000365033, HD0000000397123, 
 HD0000000407757, HD0000000436041, HD0000000588136, HD0000000592062)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Surrogate settings are rejected or end prematurely.  A user might be 
 specified as a surrogate for someone who is currently or subsequently 
 acting as a surrogate for the same user.  [PSPO #1776 and #1865]
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Alert routines are modified to properly check surrogate start and end 
 date/times for surrogate loops.  If a loop exists, the surrogate settings 
 will not be permitted.  If a loop does not exist, then the surrogacy will 
 be set.
  
 5. HD0000000515480    Why are notifications coming back
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Notifications are being returned to the original recipient after a 
 surrogacy expires, even though the surrogate has viewed and processed the 
 alerts.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Patch XU*8*366 (RETURN ALERTS FROM SURROGATE) resolved a patient safety 
 issue (PSI-04-036) by modifying the handling of alerts sent to surrogates 
 to return unprocessed alerts to the originally intended recipient of the 
 alert after a surrogacy period ends.  As a side-effect of Remedy ticket 
 HD0000000069554, the alerts are identified as deleted, but not processed, 
 when a GUI user processes the alerts.  Modified GETUSER1^XQALDATA to 
 update the alert tracking file when viewing alerts in a RPC Broker call.
  
 6. HD0000000254755    Kernel alert doesn't include POSSIBLE MALIG
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Kernel alert doesn't include POSSIBLE MALIG in the routine XQALERT1 at 
 DOIT1 to notify clinicians on urgent matters.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Patch XU*8*513 adds a new ALERT CRITICAL TEXT file (#8992.3) which 
 can hold a string of text that will identify an alert that should be 
 identified as critical.  Routines XQALERT and XQALERT1 have been modified
 to use information from this file instead of hard-coded text within the 
 routines.
