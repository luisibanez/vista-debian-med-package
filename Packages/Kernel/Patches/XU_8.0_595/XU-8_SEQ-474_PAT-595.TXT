Subject: BSE LOGIN FAILURES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 A problem has been reported at some sites for VistA Imaging's use of 
 Broker Security Enhancement (BSE). Specifically, both the VIX and VistARad
 components of VistA Imaging have been affected. These both rely on a
 station#-based callback mechanism in BSE to call back to the home server
 during remote authentication. This problem has not been reported for other
 BSE-using applications (e.g., VistAWeb and CAPRI) that do not use BSE's
 station#-based callback mechanism. 
  
 After this patch, BSE, as used by VistA Imaging, will perform lookups
 based on station# in the HL LOGICAL LINK file using the "C" (INSTITUTION)
 index. Lookups were failing previously under at least some circumstances.
  
 Additionally, after this patch, BSE, as used by VistA Imaging, is modified
 to use a fallback station-based reverse DNS lookup mechanism, via the
 VISTASITESERVICE server (as defined in VistA Imaging's File #2005.2,
 NETWORK LOCATION).
  
 Finally, this patch will record troubleshooting information in the case of
 BSE login failures. BSE is used to log users into remote sites in several
 applications, including VistA Imaging (VIX and VistARad functions), CAPRI
 and VistAWeb. Currently when a BSE login fails, there is little
 troubleshooting information recorded or displayed to the end-user. 
 After this patch, When a BSE login failure is encountered, a new error
 trap will be recorded with the subject of "BSE LOGIN FAILURE". If many of
 these errors are recorded, they can be both filtered and limited based on
 this subject line, using Kernel's error trap mechanisms to filter and
 limit errors.
