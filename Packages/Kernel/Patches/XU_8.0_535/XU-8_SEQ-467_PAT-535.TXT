Subject: ADD SUFFIXES TO XLFNAME1

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Issue:
 This patch adds 3 name suffixes (ARNP, DO and PA) to the Kernel API 
 STDNAME^XLFNAME(): Name Standardization Routine.  The suffixes ARNP, DO 
 and PA are added to two locations: CHKSUF^XLFNAME1() and 
 CHKSUF1^XLFNAME1().
  
 Test:
 To test this patch call the API directly STDNAME^XLFNAME() and use each 
 new suffix (ARNP, DO and PA) in the name.  Refer to the documentation 
 section for detail on this API.
  
 Example:
 >S NAME="MOUSE,MICKY ARNP"
 >D STDNAME^XLFNAME(.NAME,"CP")  
  
 >ZW NAME
 NAME="MOUSE,MICKY ARNP"
 NAME("FAMILY")="MOUSE"
 NAME("GIVEN")="MICKY"
 NAME("MIDDLE")=""
 NAME("SUFFIX")="ARNP"
  
 Flags:
 C - returns name components in the NAME array
 P - removes text in the parentheses (), brackets [ ], or braces { }, from 
 the name.
