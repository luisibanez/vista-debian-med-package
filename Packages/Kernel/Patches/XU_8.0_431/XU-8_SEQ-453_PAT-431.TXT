 Patch Tracking #: 47075861
 Test sites:
 - LITTLE ROCK, AR VAMC
 - MONTANA HCS 
 - SAN DIEGO, CA VAMC
 - TAMPA, FL VAMC
 Blood Bank Clearance: 03/04/2008
  
         Patch XU*8*431
  
 1. For Developers: New API APPERROR^%ZTER("Application error")
 will put the text passed in as the error name in the error trap.
  
 2. To address the situation at Ann Arbor where the error trap was called 
 until a disk full issue brought the site down. The error trap routine
 ^%ZTER now will check a count in the error trap summary file (#3.077) and
 stop recording errors once this limit has been reached. This limit is
 initialized to 10 but can be changed by the sites by using FileMan to edit
 the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) field ERROR LIMIT (#520.1).
  
 3. Changed the UCI,VOL field (#4.04) in the Error Number Multiple (#1) of 
 the Error Log file (#3.075) to hold the output from GETENV^%ZOSV.
  
 4. Error Trap Summary.  When run it reads the current ERROR LOG file(#3.075), 
 and builds an entry in file 3.077 for each error found in a 
 specific routine and a specific location in that routine.  Various parts of 
 the error are captured in this file and kept over the long term so that the 
 first and the most recent occurrences are recorded and can be tracked. 
 Differences in the access option and the stack are captured if different 
 from the first captured error.  This file serves as the first stage of a 
 Regional/National monitoring program which will help us find the systemic 
 software problems and solve them.  This will result in a stronger and more 
 resilient application environment while allowing us to focus our efforts 
 where they will do the most good.
 The loading of this file is done by scheduling option "Update Error Trap 
 Summary" [XUER UPDATE DEMAND/BATCH] to run each day. After loading any new
 errors to the file if the KSP (#8989.3) field SEND ERROR SUMMARY (#520.2) is
 set to Yes it will scan the file and send a message for any error that has
 not been sent before to the mail group XTER SUMMARY LOAD.  One member of the
 mail group is S.XTER SUMMARY LOAD@FORUM.VA.GOV.
  
 5. Remedy ticket HD278949.
 Using the option REMOVE A TYPE OF ERROR [XUERTRP TYPE]
 would cause following errors to overwrite errors that had not been removed.
 In investigating this, XINDEX reported that XTERPUR had locks without
 timeouts.  This has been corrected.  The main issue is fixed in %ZTER.
  
 6. E-mail
 Made a change so printing an error to the screen included the header
 information. 
  
 7. Added a Option Error Trap Param Edit [XUER EDIT PARAMS] to the Kernel 
 Management Menu [XUKERNEL].
  
 The DD changes are listed after the install instructions.
  
 Also included in the Build are:

 Installation Instructions:
  
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   3.  Users can remain on the system. 
       This patch can be loaded any non-peak time.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   4.  Installation will take less than 2 minutes.

       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? No//
  
       The post-init routine will automatically rename ZTER to %ZTER.
  
   5.  Schedule the option Update Error Trap Summary [XUER UPDATE DEMAND/BATCH]
       to run each day to move date from the Error Trap to the Error trap
       Summary and to FORUM if the SEND ERROR SUMMARY flag is set.
       
   6.  Review your Error Trap Screens.  You will still want to use them
       to limit the number of errors you recorded.

                                 error. It is a means of providing a common
                                 key for the errors to be clustered
                                 under.  Each one will has a series of
                                 characteristics which will be captured for
                                 later analysis even after the error has
                                 been purged off of the ^%ZTER global. 
                                 The first date and time is stored as will be

               LAST EDITED:      DEC 17, 1999 
               DESCRIPTION:     This is the first date and time that the error
                                has occurred.  It is of historic importance and
                                can be used to find the causative event of the 
                                error that is being reported.

               LAST EDITED:      DEC 17, 1999 
               DESCRIPTION:     This is the most recent time that the situation
                                has happened.  It is important in that it is
                                the most likely to still be in the error trap 
                                global, ^%ZTER.  
  
              TECHNICAL DESCR:  As this gets updated, the date is compared with
                                the date/time stored here.  This will help to
                                identify any items which may need to be
                                accessioned into this summary.  It may also be
                                used to help purge any errors which have not 
                                been active in a long time (and perhaps is now
                                obsolete code).

                                It will be parsed out of the error string in
                                .01.  This will make the errors much easier to
                                cluster around the causative routine.  This may
                                actually be amended from the error string
                                presentation if the causative program is found
                                to be different.

                                 Eventually, as a package is identified, the
                                 primaries and secondaries will be notified of

                                 happens.  
  
             TECHNICAL DESCR:  This is a pointer to the Package File.  Each
                               package should indicate a mail group that
                               tracks the responsible parties for this
                               specific package.  This should include any IRM

                               personnel in the specific area of concern with
                               this package.  The groups should be
                               self-enrolling and be able to receive the 
                               generated email that will be batched for the

                                execution was accessed.  It is a series of
                                segments, each representing a level of
                                execution in the model as it was being
                                performed.  Occasionally this list of segments 
                                will exceed the string length so some judicious
                                exiting has been done to keep the stack list
                                manageable.  Should the list need to be
                                trimmed, segments will be taken out of the
                                middle of the stack to accommodate the string
                                limits.  These omissions are marked with an
                                ellipsis "..." where a segment or segments have
                                been deleted.  
                                A segment looks like this;

                                  The set of segments is wrapped in square
                                brackets and stored in its entirety in the
                                event node for comparison with other
                                events.
