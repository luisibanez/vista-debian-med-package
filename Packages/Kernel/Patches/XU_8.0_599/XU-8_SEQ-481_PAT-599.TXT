Subject: Fix ENDOFFILE Errors

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix <ENDOFFILE> errors trapped in the VistA error log by
 various Kernel routines when attempting to read from a terminal session
 that is no longer connected to VistA.
  
 A new function $$ENDOFILE is added to routine ^%ZISUTL to set the
 sequential file end-of-file handling to be consistent among different
 operating systems.  The default setting for Cache on Linux/Unix differs
 from settings on VMS and Windows.  The desired setting is for all Cache
 versions on all operating systems to function as in the older DS.M version
 of MUMPS for terminal sessions and host file handling (set $ZEOF=-1 at
 end-of-file).
  
 Routine ^%ZIS is modified to call the new $$ENDOFILE^%ZISUTL function to 
 set end-of-file handling when a terminal session is first established.  
 This modification will have no effect on broker or VistAlink connections.
  
 Routine ^%ZISH is modified on all Cache versions to replace a hard-coded 
 set of the end-of-file handling (when opening a host file) with the new
 function call.

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*599 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch does
 not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards or
 safety critical elements functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*599 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 1. HD0000000476379 ENDOFFILE Error Messages (Duplicate HD0000000619925)
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Sites with Linux Front End (FE) servers have been seeing quite a few 
 <ENDOFFILE>ASK+1^XQ errors in the error trap.  Cache <ENDOFFILE> errors
 occur during sequential Input/Output (IO) device READ statements when 
 there is no data to READ.  Analysis of the error trap reveals that the 
 server is trying to READ input from a user session, but there is no longer
 a valid connection to an IO device.  The system variable $ZA is set to 
 2048, which corresponds to a Cache error of "The process is disconnected 
 from its principal device."
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Function $$ENDOFILE^%ZISUTL has been created to set end-of-file handling 
 for terminal I/O on Cache systems to be consistent with older DS.M 
 versions of MUMPS. Instead of trapping an <ENDOFFILE> error, it will set 
 the system variable $ZEOF=-1 when end-of-file is reached.  It will not be
 called for valid <ENDOFFILE> errors, such as when a report which requires 
 interactive user input is tasked to a printer (which cannot provide that 
 input).

 The most up-to-date VA Kernel end-user documentation is available on the
 VHA Software Document Library (VDL) at the following Internet Website:

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch cannot be queued.  RELOAD^ZTMGRSET command will automatically
 run on the node where the patch is installed as part of 
 the post-installation routine (please take note of the prompts and 
 answer them according to the instructions).  However, the RELOAD^ZTMGRSET
 will need to be run on each of the VistA nodes after the patch is
 installed.  See the post-installation section for instructions.
  
 Place TaskMan in a wait state. (DO WAIT^ZTMKU)
  
 Inhibit users from login into the system.  (If you install when a few 
 users are on the system and the possibility of some CLOBER errors is 
 acceptable, then users can stay on the system.)
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch may be installed with user on the system although it is 
 recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential disruption to users.  This patch should take less than 15 
 minutes to install.
  
 There are no options that need to be disabled.
  
 1.  Choose the PackMan message containing this patch.
  
 2.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
  
 3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation Menu.  From this menu, you may elect to use the
     following option. When prompted for the INSTALL enter the patch #(ex.
     XU*8.0*599):
  
     a.  Print Transport Global - This option lets you print the contents
         of a Transport Global that is currently loaded in the ^XTMP
         global.
     b.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
     c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
         (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
     d.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
         you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
         transport global.
      
 4.  From the Installation Menu, select the Install Package(s) option and
     choose the patch to install.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of
     Install? NO//' answer "NO".   
  
 6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//' answer "YES". (Enter YES/NO based on pre-installation 
     instructions).
  
 7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
     and Protocols? NO//' answer "NO".
  
 8.  If prompted "Delay Install (Minutes):  (0 - 60): 0// respond 0.
  
  
 Post-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 1.  After the patch is installed, remove TaskMan from wait state. (DO
 RUN^ZTMKU).
  
 2.  The post-installation routine POST^XU8P599 will automatically run 
 RELOAD^ZTMGRSET on the VistA node where the patch is installed (please 
 note the prompts below and answer them as instructed).  However, it will
 need to manually be run on each of the VistA nodes from programmer mode.  
 When prompted for a patch number, type in 599.
