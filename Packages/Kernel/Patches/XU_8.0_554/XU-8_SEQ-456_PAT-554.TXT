Description:
============

 ATTENTION: After the patch is installed, you should edit the new field
 created by the patch. Please review the instructions.
  
 1.     Remedy Ticket 436497:
 ^TMP fills up, causing FILEFULL errors at sites whose ^TMP, ^UTILITY, and
 ^XUTL("XQ") globals are local to each node. Kernel is not doing a good-enough
 job of cleaning out temp globals left by dead jobs. These jobs ended without
 cleaning up after themselves, either because they ended abnormally, or
 because they just weren't programmed to do so. So the task falls to Kernel,
 just like the task of picking up after a recalcitrant teenager falls to the
 parent. Kernel has no way of telling whether ^TMP, ^UTILITY, and ^XUTL("XQ"
 are local to each node or if everything is clustered together. With this
 patch, Kernel adds a new field to the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3) file,
 so that the site can tell Kernel what's what. This will improve Kernel's temp
 global purging after a job is recognized as dead.
 (Routine ^XQ82)
  
 The following field has been added to the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS (#8989.3)
 file. After the patch is installed, you will need to set this new field to
 YES, if it describes the setup at your site:
 8989.3,.07    LOCAL TMP           0;7 SET
                              '0' FOR No; 
                              '1' FOR Yes; 
               LAST EDITED:   NOV 10, 2010 
               HELP-PROMPT:   Are ^TMP, ^UTILITY, & ^XUTL("XQ") local to each 
                              node in a multi-node system as in Cache? 
               DESCRIPTION:   Set this field to Yes if ^TMP, ^UTILITY, and
                              ^XUTL("XQ") are local to each node in a
                              multi-node system as in Cache. Set it to No if
                              everything is clustered together.
  
 To test this fix, you'll need to be a site whose ^TMP, ^UTILITY, & ^XUTL("XQ")
 globals are local to each node. Check your nodes now. Is there a humongous
 amount of ^TMP hanging around one of your nodes that Kernel never seems to
 clean out? (Kind of like the pigeons in St. Mark's Square.) Here are some TMP
 globals to check. They're left by a package I won't identify *cough* BCMA
 *cough*:
 ^TMP("PSJ",n,
 ^TMP("TK PSJ1",n,  (where n should be a $J)
 Sites have reported seeing hundreds of thousands of nodes under these temp
 globals. After the patch is installed, set the new field to YES (only if it
 applies to your site!) and D ^XQ82 from the programmer prompt. ^TMP should
 be svelte again. If your Cache config is such that each node has its own ^TMP
 then you will need to run XQ82 from programmer mode on each node.
  
 2.     Remedy Ticket 436667, 439704:
 After patch XU*8*534, the lock table can fill up. This is because of an
 unfortunate mismatch of a lock/unlock. The routine locks one node, but later
 unlocks a different one. Also, the routine can quit before it unlocks the
 node if it encounters a task without a zero node in ^%ZTSK. These problems
 are fixed in this patch.
 (Routine ^XUTMHR)
  
 To test this fix, you'd need to monitor the lock table, perhaps with Cache
 Cube, to watch the locking of ^%ZTSK nodes. Then, from the programmer prompt,
 D HOUR^XUTMHR. Before the patch, you should notice that the job grabs lots
 of locks. After the patch, you should notice that the job only has one lock
 at a time.
  
 Documentation
 =============
 No documentation changes were necessary for this patch. The most up-to-date
 Kernel end-user documentation is available on the VHA Software Document
 Library (VDL) at the following Internet Website:
     http://www.va.gov/vdl/application.asp?appid=10
  
 NOTE: VistA documentation is made available online in Microsoft Word 
 format (.DOC) and Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (.PDF).
  
 Blood Bank Clearance
 ====================
 Clearance - 2/16/11
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*554 contains
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch 
 does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design 
 safeguards or safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*554 have no effect on Blood
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 Installation Instructions
 =========================
 *************************************************************************
 * After the patch is installed, make sure you edit the new field and    *
 * make sure to set it to the correct value for your site. See Step 5.   *
 *************************************************************************
 >>>Users may remain on the system.
 >>>TaskMan does *not* need to be stopped.
 >>>Installation will take less than 1 minute.
  
   1.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   2.  The patch has now been loaded into a Transport global on your
       system. You now need to use KIDS to install the Transport global.
       On the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global
          Compare Transport Global to Current System              
          Backup a Transport Global
  
   3.  Users can remain on the system. 
       This patch can be queued and installed, preferably just after the hour.
       TaskMan can remain running.
  
   4.  Installation will take less than 1 minute. Install just after the hour.
          Install Package(s)  'XU*8.0*554'
                               ==========
       Accept the following defaults:
  
       Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? NO//
  
       Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and Protocols? NO//
  
       Note: The Post-Init will delete any pre-existing invalid data at the
       site of the new field. After the patch is installed, you may delete
       the Post-Init routine ^XU8P554.
  
   5.  Edit the new LOCAL TMP (#.07) field in the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS
       (#8989.3) file. If your site's ^TMP, ^UTILITY, & ^XUTL("XQ") globals
       are local to each node, set it to YES. Otherwise, set it to NO.
       If you are unsure, enter a Remedy ticket to ask for help.
  
   6.  Sites which have instances of ^TMP, ^UTILITY, & ^XUTL on more than
       one node should schedule option XQ XUTL $J NODES (Clean old Job
       Nodes in XUTL) to run on each node.
  
   7.  From the programmer prompt, D ^XQ82. Again, sites which have instances
       of ^TMP, ^UTILITY, & ^XUTL on more than one node should D ^XQ82 on
       each node.
