  KAAJEE v1.1 is the successor to KAAJEE 1.0
  that was originally released to support the BEA WebLogic Server 8.1 platform.
  However, Version 1.1 of KAAJEE now supports BEA WebLogic Server 9.2 and 
  later. 
  Note:  KAAJEE v1.1 is NOT compatible with BEA WebLogic Server 8.1.
  
  Like KAAJEE v1.0, KAAJEE v1.1 provides a custom Authentication Provider
  plug-in for BEA WebLogic J2EE servers, and a set of web forms
  for web applications, that allow a web application to authenticate
  and authorize an end-user using a Kernel system as the source
  of authentication and authorization.
  
  Version 1.1 of KAAJEE implements all current features of KAAJEE v1.0.
  
  Included in the distribution are the following:
       :: KAAJEE v1.1 jar files
       :: Folder of Login web forms for Forms Authentication to drop
          into a J2EE web application
       :: JavaDoc API documentation for the user manager classes
       :: Deployment Descriptor examples
       :: Complete source code for the KAAJEE implementation
       :: Sample Web Application
       :: SSO/UC CCOW elements to make the Sample Web Application
          SSO enabled
  
  VA Facilities (VAMCs) are expected to install the M-side component
  as this brings in a new routine and other KIDS components.
  
  M KIDS Components:
  ==================
  
   BUILD COMPONENT: ROUTINE
   ENTRIES: XUSKAAJ1                       ACTION: SEND TO SITE
  
   POST-INSTALL ROUTINE: POST^XU8P504
  
  This post-install will add the following Application Proxy:  KAAJEE,PROXY.
  
  Options:
  
   BUILD COMPONENT: OPTION

   ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON        ACTION: SEND TO SITE
  
  The XUS KAAJEE WEB LOGON is a "B"-type option.  This option contains
  references to the following RPCs in its "RPC" multiple:
  
      * XUS KAAJEE GET CCOW TOKEN      
  
  The XUS KAAJEE PROXY LOGON is a "B"-type option.  This option contains
  references to the following RPCs in its "RPC" multiple:
  
      * XUS KAAJEE GET USER VIA PROXY

   BUILD COMPONENT: REMOTE PROCEDURE
   ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE GET CCOW TOKEN      ACTION: SEND TO SITE
   ENTRIES: XUS KAAJEE GET USER VIA PROXY  ACTION: SEND TO SITE
  
  VA Facilities are not expected to install the Java-side components
  unless they have their own J2EE Application Server(s)
  (e.g.:  BEA WebLogic Server) and managed them as well as develop
  their own local J2EE web-based applications.
  
  Summary of issues addressed:
  
  *  Fully integrate Kernel/KAAJEE patch XU*8.0*451/KAAJEE 1.0.1.003.
  
  *  Add JavaScript code to warn users when login session is about to expire.
  
  *  Compiled and tested KAAJEE against SDS 13.0.
  
  *  Compiled and tested KAAJEE against VistaLink 1.6.0.025.
  
  *  Compiled and tested KAAJEE against BEA WebLogic 9.2 and 10.x platforms.
  
  *  Resolve deprecated BEA WebLogic Java Management Extensions (JMX),
     Java classes and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
  
  *  Provide KAAJEE Sample Web Application.
  
  *  Provide enhanced SSL/TLS support.
  
  *  Provide SSO/UC CCOW elements to support Single Sign-on.
  
  Kernel Authentication and Authorization for J2EE (KAAJEE) is used by 
  several HealtheVet-VistA applications (e.g.:  Blind Rehabilitation,
  Veterans Personal Finance System(VPFS), Clinical Data Repository Health Data
  Repository(CHDR), etc.) to provide authentication and authorization services.
  Both KAAJEE and these consuming applications are Java 2 Platform, Enterprise
  Edition (J2EE) applications that rely on a J2EE Application Server
  (specifically WebLogic Server) to run.
  
  WebLogic Server is one element of the WebLogic Platform that includes:
  Portal, Integration, Workshop IDE, JRockit, and other technologies.
  Of these technologies, only WebLogic server is in the scope of the
  Technical Reference Model (TRM) assessment that includes recommendations
  and forecasts.  These forecasts project various releases for stages
  of planning, evaluation, supported and deprecated.  It is the TRM
  Forecast(02/12/2009) that has projected WebLogic 8.1 to be deprecated
  in fourth quarter of CY2009.  Furthermore, this TRM has forecasted WebLogic 9.2
  and 10.3 to be supported from Q4 of CY2009 through at least Q1 of CY2011.
  
  KAAJEE 1.1 is part of the WebLogic Upgrade (WLU) Project that includes
  FatKAAT 1.1 and VistaLink 1.6.  It is the WLU Project that is collectively
  providing the security and infrastructure needs for these and future
  consuming applications to migrate from WebLogic 8.1 to either
  WebLogic 9.2 or 10.3.
  
  KAAJEE 1.1 is being packaged and distributed through this patch.  This patch
  incorporates all functional changes that were included in Kernel/KAAJEE
  patch XU*8.0*451/KAAJEE 1.0.1.003.
  
  To comply with Section 508 requirements, KAAJEE 1.1 has incorporated
  JavaScript code to warn users when the login session is about to expire.
  
  KAAJEE 1.0 was limited in the SSL/TLS support such that often in production
  environments, the use of a load balancer like BIG-IP from F5 was used
  to provide SSL mapping.  KAAJEE 1.1 now enhances SSL support to handle
  additional use cases.
  
  This patch adds the capability to KAAJEE applications to use Single
  Sign-On (SSO) as described in the Single Sign-On/User Context Project.
  That is, the SSO capability is implemented within the framework of the
  HL7 CCOW User Context standard.  Additional details are available in the
  VistA document Library, in the document "SINGLE SIGN-ON/USER CONTEXT
  (SSO/UC) DEPLOYMENT GUIDE."  For this implementation, only the User Context
  is tracked, and there is no capability or APIs available yet to track
  the Patient Context.  In other words, the KAAJEE applications
  will be CCOW-enabled to the extent of tracking User Context changes.
  By changes, we mean when a user is logged on and when a user is logged off.
  To meet some of the requirements listed in the deployment guide mentioned
  above, KAAJEE applications will be enabled to be logged off when using
  the CCOW Monitor to clear the User Context.

  The M-side component of this patch will be available in the form
  of a KIDS file and/or enclosed ZIP distribution
  from one of the following OI Field Office ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE
  directories via FTP:
  
     IRM Field Office        FTP Address

  The Java-side component will be in a ZIP format and will be accompanied
  by an MD5 checksum file.  These files will also be available from the
  above FTP sites.
  
  These files will look similar to the following:
  
  KAAJEE_1_1_0_007.ZIP

  Note:  The Java-side components will only need to be installed if you have
  BEA WebLogic Server 9.2 or 10.x.
  These servers will most likely be located at one or more central locations
  servicing HealtheVet-VistA applications (e.g.:  Blind Rehab, VPFS, PATS,
  CHDR, etc.).
