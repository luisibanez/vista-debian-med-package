Subject: Updated XU*8*548 post install instructions

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch is for informational purposes only and should not be
 installed. It addresses changes to the Post-Installation Instructions
 associated with patch XU*8.0*548.  The post-installation instructions
 provided with XU*8.0*548 were inaccurate.  The proper configuration
 of VistA will be clarified with these updated instructions.
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Post-Installation instructions for XU*8.0*548 stated that it was a
 requirement to add the VA.GOV synonym to the site's domain.  This
 requirement has been removed as it could cause problems.  If you
 added the synonym VA.GOV as part of the installation of XU*8.0*548
 then REMOVE it.  Your domain is defined correctly if you can send
 messages to @VA.GOV email addresses.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Sites that installed XU*8.0*548 into their production environments
 should do the following: 
     1. If you added VA.GOV as a synonym as described in the 
        Post-Installation instructions, you should remove it. VA.GOV
        should not be a synonym of any site.
     2. You should review the Q-NPS.VA.GOV domain configuration to
        insure that the FLAGS field (#1) contains an 'S'.
         
  
 The full updated post installation instructions can be found at the
 bottom of this message.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------ 
 UPDATED documentation describing the new instructions clarified by this 
 informational patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
 ftp://download.vista.med.va.gov/.  This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly
 from a specific server as follows:
   
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov>
  
 Documentation can also be found on the VA Software Documentation Library

 Updated Post Installation Instructions for XU*8.0*548:
 -----------------------------------------------------
 There are several manual post-installation steps associated with this
 patch. The purpose of these instructions is to make sure that your system
 is configured properly for this NPI Crosswalk Extract so that it will run
 every time the CBO requests it via the NPI Administration website.
  
 For the NPI Crosswalk Extract process to work correctly several
 requirements must be met:
  
 1.  The NPI EXTRACT VERIFICATION mail group must be defined and correctly
     configured.  Make sure the REMOTE MEMBER address is present and is
     correctly typed. The correct configuration is:

   REFERENCE COUNT: 65                   LAST REFERENCED: JUN 01, 2010
   RESTRICTIONS: UNRESTRICTED
   MEMBER: XXXXX,XXXXXX
   DESCRIPTION: Members of this mail group will automatically receive an 
                email verification entry for each NPI Extract file that has
                been generated at the sites.
   ORGANIZER: POSTMASTER
   REMOTE MEMBER: vhaconpiextractmonitoring@VA.GOV
  
        The remote member MUST be entered exactly as shown above.

    ****************************************************************
  
  
  
 2. The Q-NPS.VA.GOV domain must exist and the field 'FLAGS' must be
    defined with a value of 'S'.  Example shown below.

   LEVEL 3 NAME (c): Q-NPS.VA.GOV        LEVEL 4 NAME (c): Q-NPS.VA.GOV
  
  
   
 3. The logical link NPI OUT must exist and be configured as follows, where
    the field 'TCP/IP ADDRESS' is populated correctly and the field
    'AUTOSTART' MUST be set to 'Enabled'.  Example shown below.
