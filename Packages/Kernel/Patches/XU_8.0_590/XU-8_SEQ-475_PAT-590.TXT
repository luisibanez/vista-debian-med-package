Subject: USER INQUIRY FIXES FOR MIXED-OS VISTA

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes problems on a mixed-OS VistA system where the option 
 "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] does not display active sessions on all nodes.
  
 The option is intended to display the user's job and device numbers, 
 the sign-on time, and the menu path of the option being executed.  
 On a mixed-OS system, some of this data is no longer available.  If 
 an active session is on a different VistA node than the one on which 
 the "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] is executed, then VistA does not 
 display the menu path and marks the session in the SIGN-ON LOG (file 
 #3.081) as forced closed.
  
 This patch changes the "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] to display a message 
 "You must sign-on to node <node name> to see this menu path." and does 
 not mark the session as forced closed if the user's session is on a 
 different VistA node than the one on which the "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] 
 is executed.
  
 This patch also fixes the "Find a User" [XU FINDUSER] option, as it uses 
 the same routine as the "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ].

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 1. HD0000000584600 User Inquiry causes dropped connections
  
 Problem:
 -------
 On a mixed-OS VistA system, doing a "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] on a user
 with multiple sessions on more than one VistA node displays the user's
 current jobs on each node, and the menu path on the node where the "User
 Inquiry" was executed. A subsequent "User Inquiry" shows only the jobs on
 the current node.  The user's jobs on other nodes are marked forced
 closed in the sign-on log, although they continue to be active.
  
 Historically, the user's job identification ($J) is unique to the system, 
 but on a mixed-OS VistA, it is only unique to a specific node.  Also, the 
 user's menu path is stored in global ^XUTL("XQ",$J), which historically 
 was unique to the system.  However, on a mixed-OS environment, the 
 global ^XUTL("XQ",$J) is also unique only to the current node.  VistA can 
 no longer identify the session as active, and cannot display the menu 
 path if the active session is on a different node than the one on which 
 the "User Inquiry" [XUSERINQ] is being executed.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified routine ^XUS9 to check current node id and compare with node id 
 in the sign-on log.  If user is not on the same node as the entry in the 
 sign-on log, then the log will not be edited, and a message "You must 
 sign-on to node <node name> to see this menu path." will be displayed.
