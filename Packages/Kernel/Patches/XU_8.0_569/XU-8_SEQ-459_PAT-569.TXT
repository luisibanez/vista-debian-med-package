Subject: SECONDARY MENU DISPLAY NODES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes a problem in the Menu Manager that has occasionally
 caused the compiled form of the secondary menus, located in the
 ^XUTL("XQO",) global, to become corrupted for some users
 at some sites.   This patch will prevent the problem from occurring. 
 Also, the post-install routine will recompile the secondary menus for
 all users. 
  
 Specific instances of this problem were verified to occur in Long Beach
 while using the HealthEVet application RELEASE OF INFORMATION
 MANAGER, but the problem may also occur in other situations.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
   1. Users are allowed to be on the system during the installation.  It is
      recommended that the installation be queued during off-peak hours,
      because the post-installation routine will recompile the secondary
      menus for all users. The installation could take up to 15 minutes
  
   2. You DO NOT need to stop TaskMan or the background filers.
  
   3.  Use the 'INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE' option on the PackMan menu. This
       option will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   4.  This patch is now loaded into a transport global on your system.
       The next step is to use KIDS to install the Transport global.  On
       the KIDS menu, under the 'Installation' menu, use the following
       options:
  
          Verify Checksums in Transport Global
          Print Transport Global 
          Compare Transport Global to Current System 
          Backup a Transport Global
          Install Package(s) 
  
       When using the Install Package(s) menu option to install the 
       patch build, you may be asked several questions.  The questions,
       and the answers you should supply, are shown below.
  
        INSTALL NAME: <XU*8.0*569>
  
        Want KIDS to Rebuild Menu Trees Upon Completion of Install? <NO>
  
        Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONS during the install? NO// <NO>
  
        Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options,
          and Protocols? NO// <NO>
   
   6. Verify that the install completed.   No further steps are needed. 
  
   7.  The post-install routine ^XUP569 should not be deleted.  It can be
        run again to recompile the user secondary menus without causing
        any harm.
