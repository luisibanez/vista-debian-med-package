Subject: Fix Record Locks and Checksums

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch fixes errors in four Kernel routines and provides one 
 enhancement.
  
 Routines ^XQ, ^XQ12, and ^XQTOC are modified to display <TEST ACCOUNT>
 when displaying VistA menus in a test environment, removing the need for
 systems administrators to modify the routines in test accounts.
  
 Routines ^XQ12 and ^XQ83 are modified to The Department of Veterans 
 Affairs M Programming Standards and Conventions (SAC) policy on using 
 incremental record locks.  No VistA functionality is changed as a result 
 of these modifications.
  
 A new menu option "User start-up event" [XU USER START-UP] is added to the
 OPTION file (#19).  The option will provide sites with a means to include
 interactive user input upon VistA sign-on before the Primary Menu Option
 is displayed.  Instructions for using the new option will be included in
 the Kernel manuals in their next maintenance update.

 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch XU*8*593 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in VHA OI SEPG SOP 192-023 Review of 
 VISTA Patches for Effects on VISTA Blood Bank Software. This patch 
 does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software design safeguards
 or safety critical elements functions.
   
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch XU*8*593 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.

 "User start-up event"
 [XU USER START-UP]            X:extended action   New
 This is an option used exclusively during a VistA user sign-on event. 
 Items listed in this option are "TYPE:action" options in the OPTION file
 (#19) that can be used to prompt users for input upon VistA sign-on and
 before their Primary Menu Option is displayed.  It will not be used for
 GUI sign-on.  It is called from XQ12.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  HD0000000408572    Locks left on global XUTL
  HD0000000583660    PATCH XU*8*570 CHECKSUMS DO NOT AGREE
  HD0000000595357    LOCAL MOD TO XUS1
  
 1. HD0000000408572 Locks left on global XUTL
  
 Problem:
 -------
 In MERGE^XQ12, MGPXU^XQ12 and MGSEC^XQ12 the lock and unlock are on 
 different globals.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified routine ^X12 to add a corresponding "unlock" on global ^XUTL to 
 match the record lock. Removed the "unlock" on global ^DIC(19, as it was 
 never locked.  Replaced zero timeout on the incremental locks with global 
 variable DILOCKTM per SAC 2.4.6.1 "All incremental LOCKS must have a 
 timeout, the timeout must not be less than the value of the Kernel 
 variable DILOCKTM".  Also found and corrected incremental record locks in 
 routine ^XQ83 that violated the same policy.
  
 2. HD0000000583660 PATCH XU*8*570 CHECKSUMS DO NOT AGREE
  
 Problem:
 -------
 During installation of patch XU*8*570 in the test account, it was found
 that routine checksums for ^XQ did not agree with the patch description.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 NVSSTAR routines are used to create a test environment from a production
 Backup. They modify the routine ^XQ to display the text <TEST ACCOUNT> 
 when prompting for a VistA menu option.  Routine ^XQ was changed to check 
 for variable DUZ("TEST") before displaying menus, so this modification
 will no longer be necessary when creating a test environment.  DUZ("TEST")
 is set in routine ^XQ12 if the VistA system is not a production
 environment.  Routines are ^XQ12 and ^XQTOC are similarly modified where 
 menu prompts are created.
  
 3. HD0000000595357 LOCAL MOD TO XUS1
  
 Problem:
 -------
 VISN 23 has modified ^XUS1 to display alerts when users log into VISTA 
 when they have IFCAP reconciliations and pending actions to complete.  It 
 also displays users' locations, phone numbers, room numbers, etc. and 
 prompts users when information is missing or needs to be updated.  Since 
 ^XUS1 is a Kernel routine that does not permit local modifications, a 
 change needs to be considered that will meet local site needs while 
 maintaining the integrity of Kernel software.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 This patch adds option "User start-up event" [XU USER START-UP] to the
 OPTION file (#19) and modifies routine ^XQ12 to run the new option upon
 VistA sign-on before the user's Primary Menu Option is displayed.  The new
 option allows sites to add local options that include interactive
 prompting to users upon VistA sign-on.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to minimize 
 potential for disruption to users. TaskMan should be put in a Wait State
 (DO WAIT^ZTMKU) and HL7 filers should be stopped. This patch should take
 less than 10 minutes to install.  NOTE:  When installed in a TEST 
 environment, your BEFORE checksums might not match the values shown below 
 if any of the routines were modified to display <TEST ACCOUNT> in the 
 VistA menu prompts. The checksums should match in a production 
 environment.
  
   =======================================================================
   This patch contains the routine XQ, which is the primary VistA Menu
   Manager routine.  WARNING: Taskman should be put in a Wait State (DO
   WAIT^ZTMKU) while installing this patch.  There is the possibility of a
   few <EDITED> errors with VistA (non-GUI) users being kicked off the
   system, but this will not cause any data corruption.  This patch should
   be installed when system usage is minimal.
