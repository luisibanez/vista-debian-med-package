Subject: SSN FOR DOD VISITOR USER

Category: 
  - Informational
  - Other

Description:
============

 Remote access to VistA for Department of Defense (DoD) applications uses 
 a "VISITOR" entry in the NEW PERSON file (#200) identified as "DEPARTMENT 
 OF DEFENSE,USER".  This entry uses a dummy Social Security Number (SSN) 
 of 123456789 to identify the user.
  
 Some VA sites have assigned this SSN to test users or terminated users.  
 As a result, it appears that test users or terminated users are accessing 
 patient data, giving the appearance of a security violation.
  
 To remedy the situation, the following steps should be performed:
  
    1.  Identify users with SSN 123456789
    2.  If user is "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER", then do nothing
  
        NAME: DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER        DATE ENTERED: NOV 14, 2012
        CREATOR: 0                            SSN: 123456789
         LAST SIGN-ON DATE/TIME: NOV 28, 2012@10:06:41
         XUS Logon Attempt Count: 0            XUS Active User: Yes
        ALIAS: VISITOR
         NAME COMPONENTS: 200
         SIGNATURE BLOCK PRINTED NAME: USER DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
        SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS: DVBA CAPRI GUI
        SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS: OR CPRS GUI CHART
        SECONDARY MENU OPTIONS: OR CPRS GUI CHART
  
    3.  If user is NOT "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER" then change the SSN
  
 If the site already has a "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER" entry with SSN 
 123456789, then VistA will use that entry for DoD visitor access.  If 
 not, then once these steps are completed, a new VISITOR entry will 
 automatically be created for "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER" when a remote
 DoD application accesses VistA.
  
 Example:

    STEP 1 - Identify users with SSN 123456789
    ------------------------------------------
  
    Use VA FileMan to Search for entries in file #200 that have SSN 
    "123456789".
  
    Select VA FileMan Option: Search File Entries
  
    OUTPUT FROM WHAT FILE: // 200  NEW PERSON

    589          TEST,USER THREE                      123456789
  
  
  
                             1 MATCH FOUND.
  
  
    STEP 2 - If user is "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER", then do nothing
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Note that in STEP 1 above, the search found "TEST,USER THREE" with SSN 
    "123456789", so changes will be required.  Proceed to step 3.
  
  
    STEP 3 - If user is NOT "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER" then change SSN
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Use VA FileMan to Enter/Edit entries found in the above search.  
    Replace the SSN with a value beginning with five zeros.
  
    Select VA FileMan Option: enter or Edit File Entries
  
  
  
    INPUT TO WHAT FILE: NEW PERSON// 
    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// SSN  
    THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
  
    Select NEW PERSON NAME: TEST,USER THREE              
    SSN: 123456789// 000006789

 1. HD0000000776473 Inactive visitor account used to access many sites
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The Information Security Officer (ISO) ran the monthly "Patient Same Name 
 Next of Kin" report and flagged a terminated non-VA (contractor) employee 
 as having accessed patient information after the employee termination 
 date.  Upon further research it was determined that a remote application 
 was identifying the employee by Social Security Number (SSN) "123456789" 
 as the terminated user.  This SSN should have been associated with a user 
 entry of "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER".
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 When the SSN was changed to a different value, a new "VISITOR" entry was
 automatically created with user name "DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE,USER" and SSN
 "123456789".  This patch provides instructions to identify and correct NEW
 PERSON file (#200) entries that have been improperly assigned the SSN of
 "123456789".
