Subject: FIX: <UNDEFINED> ERROR IN XUSTERM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:

                         XU*8.0*588
  
 This patch fixes an error <UNDEFINED>GET+6^XUSTERM for option 'Deactivate
 a User' [XUSERDEACT]. The error happens when a mailgroup is improperly
 killed directly from the programmer mode. The global nodes are deleted but
 the ^XMB(3.8,"AB") cross reference for the mailgroup members is not
 removed.
  
 To fix the error this patch modifies the routine XUSTERM for the option
 'Deactivate a user' [XUSERDEACT] to check the existing of related
 global nodes before removing a deactivated user from the sub-file
 Member(#3.81) in the Mail Group file(#3.8).
