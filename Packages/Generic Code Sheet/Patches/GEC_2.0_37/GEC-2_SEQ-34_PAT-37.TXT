 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000581927 ASKTOBAT^GECSXBL1+29 change ZTIO=IO TO ZTIO=ION
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Information Technology specialist at Bay Pines site requested to change
  the IO variable to the ION variable in the ZTIO string for queuing the
  output for the device in the Linux environment. According to the Kernel
  Developer's Guide, the ZTIO variable accepts the same I/O formatting 
  string as IOP variable in the ^%ZIS: Standard Device Call. The IO variable
  is returned with the device $I value of the selected device, but the ION
  variable returns the device name (.01 field) in the Device file (#3.5)
  which is the same device name (.01 field) of the IOP variable.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine GECSXBL1 was modified to replace the IO variable in the ZTIO
  string for the printer when the Taskman job starts to print the generic
  code sheet in the [GECS KEYPUNCH] option.
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
