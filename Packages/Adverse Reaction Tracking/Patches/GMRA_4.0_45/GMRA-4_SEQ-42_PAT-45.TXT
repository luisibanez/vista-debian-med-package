Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI 
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
  
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
  
 Installation and set-up information specific to OR*3*280 is included in 
 "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation Guide".   
  
 Patch information:
 PSS patches exported as two host files support CPRS v28 functionality.
 PSS_1_142.KID
 PSS_1_151.KID
  
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID includes the required patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 OR*3.0*293
 GMRC*3.0*66
 GMRA*4.0*45
  
 OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID includes the CPRS, Pharmacy and Clinical Reminders 
 patches required for CPRS GUI v28.  It includes builds for the following 
 patches: 
 OR*3.0*280
 PSJ*5.0*226
 PXRM*2.0*16
  
 CPRS28_RELATED.KID includes the related patches needed to support CPRS 
 GUI v28 functionality.  It includes builds for the following patches:
 GMRC*3.0*64
 GMTS*2.7*90
 OR*3.0*337
  
 Installation of these five host files should be coordinated among the 
 packages affected because these host files will install the software 
 needed to implement CPRS GUI v28.
  
  
 Patch OR*3.0*293 creates a centralized repository for the collection of 
 all order check information in each VISTA instance.  This repository is 
 located in the new file 100.05.  Therefore, order checking information 
 will no longer be stored with the order in file 100. Thus the ART code 
 that reads file 100 is updated in this patch to now call an API to get 
 the order checking information.
