 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000754278 - Not allow Change Title on a Rescinded Advance
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patches MAG*3.0*121 and TIU*1*261 work together so that when an Advance
 Directive is rescinded, through the Change Title action in TIU, the MAG 
 patch puts the watermark of "RESCINDED" on the attached image(s). The
 problem is that a Rescinded Advance Directive can have its title changed
 back to Advance Directive but the "RESCINDED" watermark stays on the
 attached image(s). This has the potential for causing confusing
 instructions to providers and may place a patient in jeopardy of
 receiving/not receiving actions based on the confusion caused by an
 Advance Directive with RESCINDED images attached.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Add a new business rule to prevent any user but the Chief of Management 
 Information Systems (MIS) from changing the title of a Rescinded Advance
 Directive back to Advance.
  
 This is the business rule that needs to be added:
    1    A COMPLETED (TITLE) RESCINDED ADVANCE DIRECTIVE may 
         HAVE ITS TITLE CHANGED by a CHIEF, MIS Directive.
  
 Note:
 =====
 This pertains to sites who have the [DOCUMENT DEFINITION] option  with 
 the [RESCINDED ADVANCE DIRECTIVE] option. The preferred fix for this issue
 would be functionality added to the code to prevent the Change Title for
 Rescinded Advance Directive. This would be a new service request. Until
 such time as a patch is created, tested, and released for this possible
 service request; the addition of this new business rule is the suggested
 work around. Please ensure that this is the sole business rule for the 
 title RESCINDED ADVANCE DIRECTIVE as this will prevent all users except
 for the Chief, MIS from changing the title of this note.
