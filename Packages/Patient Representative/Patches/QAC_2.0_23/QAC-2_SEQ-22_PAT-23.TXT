Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 The Patient Advocate Tracking System (PATS) is a web-based system used to 
 document, track, and report patient-related issues. PATS replaces the 
 legacy Patient Representative (Patient Rep) system. 
  
 This patch introduces updates to the web component and database (Oracle 
 11g).
  
 The updates include:
  
 1. Introduction of KAAJEE 1.0.1 (upgrade)
 2. SDS version upgrade to 18.
 3. Remedy 344975 - Erroneously handled JSPs
 4. Remedy 327260, 284833,422092 - Notification employee lookup problem
 5. Remedy 284100 - Application error during ROC entry
 6. Remedy 316775, 210322, 213510 - Application timeout redesign
 7. IRIS application interface based on SOAP protocol, PAD API, db updates

 PAD API
  
 TO interface PATS with IRIS application, a new API was introduced, called 
 PAD. This API will handle the dialog with IRIS, create the ROC
 automatically. It will then send the new ROC number back to IRIS for
 insertion into the IRIS inquiry for tracking purposes.
 Pt. Advocates at the VAMC/CBOC will see this ROC, with Information 
 Taker 'IRIS,SYSTEM', in their PATS LIST-OF-OPEN-ROCs.
 A TREATMENT STATUS of 'Undetermined - IRIS' will be used in ROCs where 
 no unique patient was found to auto-insert to the ROC
  
  
  
 KAAJEE 1.0.1
  
 For login process PATS application utilizes KAAJEE login screen which 
 provides secure signon architecture. PATS is able to authenticate against 
 Kernel on the VistA M Server via an Internet Browser on the client 
 workstation and a middle tier application server. Currently PATS is using 
 version 1.0.0.019 version of Kaajee. PATS needs to upgrade the latest 
 version (1.0.1.003) of Kaajee to integrate the new login page with the 
 following features:
  
        KAAJEE Login Page-Removal of Refresh Button. 
        Enhanced Login Functionality:
        Added JavaScript code for client-side sorting of Institutions.
        Provided Access code; Verify code capability in one line.
        Added support for parameter passing of Default Institution and
        Institution sorting preferences. This addresses the issues of
        persistent cookies when using Thin Clients and Terminal Servers.
        Made the KAAJEE Login Web page more Section 508 friendlier.

 SDS 18 Upgrade
  
 PATS uses SDS tables (Institution, Country, State and Facility Type) and 
 its corresponding API's. PATS currently uses version 9.9 of SDS.
 Currently any changes made to the SDS tables data used by the PATS 
 application is being done manually in the production database.
 These scripts need to be customized since the SDS Master at the Austin
 Information Technology Center (AITC) is not
 compatible with the version in the local PATS production database.
 The customized SQL scripts are sent by the SDS team to the HealtheVet
 Maintenance team. After the internal testing is completed successfully 
 the scripts are sent to the Enterprise Infrastructure Engineering team to 
 be applied in production database. The manual process takes place twice in
 a month with the customized scripts being sent to the HealtheVet team
 which are then packaged for installation to the production database shared
 by PATS, VPFS and SDS. 
  
 After successfully updating the PATS production database manually for the 
 SDS tables, the SDS data will soon become out of sync with the master SDS 
 table data at the AITC. Hence to keep the SDS data in the PATS production 
 database in sync with the master SDS data, replication has to take place. 
  
 Automatic replication of the data from the master database at the AITC
 to the
 local PATS production database would take place if the SDS versions 
 match. Hence upgrading the SDS version would facilitate the automatic 
 replication process to take place without any manual intervention.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket Fixes.
  
 344975          erroneously handed jsps
 Centralized production server has started to have problems responding to 
 user requests with properly compiled jsp pages. Java Server Pages as a 
 technology is integral part of PATS application architecture which 
 requires compilation by the server before a user is served with a proper 
 response to a request. The problem was identified as a lack of server's 
 heap memory availability, compounded by the forceful StringBuffer 
 allocation during run-time. The default capacity of StringBuffer objects 
 was adjusted, to avoid forcing the server to perform additional 
 allocations during runtime.
  
 327260, 284833, 422092  Employee lookup problem
 Exercising PATS Notification feature was observed to be problematic for 
 names having an apostrophe in the last name. The problem had to do with 
 the way HTML pages are being interpreted and rendered. An apostrophe 
 character happens to be one of HTML special markup characters and needs 
 either special formatting of being referred to by the UTF code in order 
 to be rendered and interpreted correctly. Such formatting has been 
 implemented and has proven to correct the problem in the development 
 environment.
  
 284100          PATS application error.
 During new ROC entry, users are allowed to enter invalid DATA OF CONTACT 
 value which will propagate via internal algorithm to creation of an 
 invalid ROC number.  Thereafter users will be prevented from closing the 
 ROC by errors triggered from the invalid ROC number. Please fix the 
 algorithm, so only valid dates can be entered into the DATE OF CONTACT 
 field during new ROC creation.
  
 316775          Cannot complete Notes.
 Users have reported multiple instances of timing out while trying to 
 complete Notes on the ROC Resolution Tab. Problem has to do with the fact 
 that PATS does not notify a user of a pending timeout, catching a person 
 in the midst of a typing/composing session.
 The typed text is lost them, since user is forced to re-login into 
 application.
  
 A proposed change consists of a notification box, blocking a PATS 
 interface (to avoid accidental focus losing issues) and presenting an 
 option to reset a timeout counter.
