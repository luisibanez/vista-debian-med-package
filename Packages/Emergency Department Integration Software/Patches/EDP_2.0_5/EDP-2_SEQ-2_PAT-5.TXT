Subject: EDP*2*4 CORRUPTION RESOLUTION

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Associated patches: EDP 2.0       <<= must be installed BEFORE 'EDP*2*5'
   
  
 This PATCH FOR A PATCH addresses the below issue, as well as a
 corruption issue encountered with EDP*2.0*4. During the release process
 routine EDPFPTC had been corrupted in the development environment
 causing the routine to be incorrect at the time of release. This patch
 resolves the logic issues within EDPFPTC.
   
 This EMERGENCY patch addresses an issue in EDIS that causes errors in
 routine XOBVSKT when selecting a patient with multiple Patient Record
 Flags (PRF's) with multiple lines of text in more than one of the flags.
  
 This patch contains a single routine (EDPFPTC), and contains no other
 patch components.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
   
 1.   #INC000000841991 - Error message Loading log entries failed.
                         Error number 1085.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Patch was installed last night and now users are unable to remove any
 patients who were on the board that were on the board at the time of
 the patch was installed and patients that were added after the patch
 was installed cannot be updated.  Error message Loading log entries
 failed.  Error number 1085.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
  EDP*2.0*4 was released with an incorrect version of EDPFPTC. The section
  of logic in EDPFPTC related to patch 4 is as follows:
  
  . F  S N=$O(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N)) Q:N<1 S 
 X=X_$C(13,10)_$G(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N,0))
  . ;F S N=$O(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N)) Q:N<1 S X=$G(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N,0)) D 
 XML^EDPX(X)
  . ;bwf - 3/1/2013 - removed line due to multiple flag issues
  . D XML^EDPX("<text>"_$$ESC^EDPX(X)_"</text>")
  . ;bwf 3/1/2013 - added following line to build footer for patient 
 record flag issues.
  . ;D XML^EDPX("</text>")
  
  
  EDP*2.0*5 corrects the logic to be the following:
  
  . ;F S N=$O(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N)) Q:N<1 S 
 X=X_$C(13,10)_$G(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N,0))
  . F  S N=$O(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N)) Q:N<1 S X=$G(EDPY(EDI,"NARR",N,0)) D 
 XML^EDPX($$ESC^EDPX(X))
  . ;bwf - 4/16/2013 - removed line due to multiple flag issues
  . ;D XML^EDPX("<text>"_$$ESC^EDPX(X)_"</text>")
  . ;bwf 4/16/2013 - added following line to build footer for patient 
 record flag issues.
  . D XML^EDPX("</text>")

 2.   #INC000000773607 - Cannot do anything with patient on board - 
                         receive error.
   
 Problem:
 -------
 Multiple Patient record flags causing patient to be inaccessible in EDIS.
   
 Resolution:
 ----------
 Modified EDPFPTC routine to build XML in a more friendly way to XOBVSKT. 
 The old logic would build the xml in a structure where there were 
 $C(13,10) values imdded and a single line was used to create the XML.
 Ex. <text> Record flag info line 1_$C(13,10)_line 2_$C(13,10)_$C(13,10) 
 </text>
  
 The modification builds the xml so that each line of text is represented 
 in the xml as the body.
   
 Ex.
 <text>
 Record flag info line 1
   
 line 2
 </text>
