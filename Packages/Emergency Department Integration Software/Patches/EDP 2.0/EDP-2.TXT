Subj: RELEASE of Emergency Department Integ. Software (EDIS) V2  [#56983]
18 Jan 2013 12:40:15 -0500 (EST)  908 lines
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------The Emergency Department Integration Software (EDIS) team is pleased to
announce the release of EDIS version 2.0.  EDIS offers an open-view 
digital log of critical activities in the Emergency Department. It 
produces a display of all active patients in the department as well as 
their location, status, and provider. The information may be displayed on 
any computer with server access via a web browser and/or on a big screen 
display centrally located in the emergency department. This updates and 
replaces the manual white board still found in many emergency departments.
 
EDIS incorporates several web-based views that extend the current 
Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) to help staff track and manage 
patient flow and patient care. EDIS offers a team-view of department 
status instead of the first-person view (one patient at a time for one 
user) common to CPRS.
 
The features and functionality included in this release are:
 
  -  Add emergency-department patients to the applications display board
 
  -  View information about patients on the display board 
 
  -  Edit patient information 
 
  -  Remove patients from the display board 
 
  -  Views for entering patients dispositions 
 
  -  Configuring the display board
 
  -  Create administrative and operational reports 
 
  -  Supports assistive reading technologies such as Job Access with 
     Speech (JAWS) for accessibility
 
 
EDIS V2.0 corrects defects found in the optional Convert local ER data
to EDIS 1.0 files [EDP CONVERSION] option.  This option allows a site to
copy the data from the class 3 Syracuse Emergency Department files 
#172000-172012 into the new Emergency Department application if they so
desire. Late in the testing cycle of the new Emergency Department 
application, a couple of small defects were identified which are being
addressed in this version as well as a small adjustment to insure closed
historical patient data is added as closed and not active.
 
EDP2_0.KID also modifies some internal timeout settings related to 
server communication and it modifies several of the reports to correct
undefined errors related to dispositions and enhances several of the
reports to better identify VA Admissions and Missed Opportunities.
It also modifies the shift report to display more than 4 shifts worth
of data in a 24 hour period as well as correcting the shifts that
occur after midnight when the start of shifts is not midnight (0:00).
The shift reports header and data are also being modified as well as
the exported version of the report.  
 
The following is a list of NEW features being released in the Emergency
Department Integration Software (Version 2.0):
 
 - Improve lab status column display
 - Re-add patient to the board who was removed in error
 - Display record of patients removed in error
 - Restore all timestamps of patients removed in error
 - Edit all timestamps associated and non-identifier values
 - Provide ability to View and Update outpatient demographics
 - Update Outpatient Demographics
 - View Outpatient Demographics
 - Search 'Edit Closed Record'
 - Add Vitals directly into EDIS 
 - Remove new entries prior to saving
 - Provide task based lab access view
 - Provide a direct admission status
 - Scroll vertically and horizontally to view all content
 - View and print med list at time of arrival and discharge
 - Print med list at time of arrival and discharge
 - View med list at time of arrival and discharge
 - Ability to view lab results
 - Acknowledgement of lab results notifications
 - Provide identification and notification of critical lab results
 - Enable identification of critical lab results
 - Enable notification of critical lab results
 - Ability to enter date/time in a simple text box
 - Ability to work directly from a status display list
 
**********************************************************************
NOTE:
 
The EDP .ear file for the Graphical User Interface will display a version 
of EDIS v2.1, while the VistA Host File will show a version of 2.0 (As 
seen in the SOFTWARE RETIVEAL). This is okay and should not be a reason 
for concern.
 
The application guides will appear with version 2.1
**********************************************************************
 
This software will be a phased release.  The EDIS Implementation Team will
contact sites prior to installation so they can complete several
pre-install steps.  Sites should not install the EDIS 2.0 software until 
the checklist has been completed and verified by the EDIS Implementation 
Team.

1. HD0000000468015   Display board times out too quickly
   
    Problem #1:
    -----------
    EDIS v1.0 was released with the ability to set a timeout and a
    timeout countdown value in VistA.  These values control how long
    the EDIS application can remain inactive before the application
    will timeout and then display a countdown timer before eventually
    logging out of the application.  Unfortunately, EDIS used the
    ORWOR TIMEOUT CHART and ORWOR TIMEOUT COUNTDOWN parameters within
    VistA to accomplish this.  These parameters also control the
    timeout and countdown values for the CPRS GUI application and
    belong to CPRS (OERR).  Because of this, the ability to modify them
    is limited by the fact the CPRS GUI must be considered first and
    sites may not wish for their CPRS timeout values to be adjusted.
    A solution was needed that would allow the EDIS timeout and
    countdown values to be adjusted independently of CPRS.
  
    Resolution #1:
    --------------
    Routine EDPFAA was modified to use two new EDIS parameters to
    determine the timeout and countdown values for the EDIS application.
    The two new parameters have been created in the PARAMETER DEFINITION
    (#8989.51) file.  The two new parameters are:
  
    NAME: EDP APP COUNTDOWN
       DISPLAY TEXT: Countdown Seconds upon Timeout
       VALUE TERM: Countdown Seconds         VALUE DATA TYPE: numeric
       VALUE DOMAIN: 0:999
       VALUE HELP: Enter the number of seconds (0 to 999) for the
                   countdown before closing EDIS.
       DESCRIPTION: This value is the number of seconds used for the
                    countdown when the timeout notification appears.
       PRECEDENCE: 1                           ENTITY FILE: USER
       PRECEDENCE: 5                           ENTITY FILE: SYSTEM
       PRECEDENCE: 9                           ENTITY FILE: PACKAGE
     
    NAME: EDP APP TIMEOUT
       DISPLAY TEXT: Timeout for EDIS application
       MULTIPLE VALUED: No                   VALUE TERM: Timeout (EDIS)
       VALUE DATA TYPE: numeric              VALUE DOMAIN: 30:999999
       VALUE HELP: Enter the number of seconds (30-999999) that should
                   pass before EDIS times out.
       DESCRIPTION: This value overrides the user's DTIME only in the
                    case of the EDIS application.
       PRECEDENCE: 1                           ENTITY FILE: USER
       PRECEDENCE: 3                           ENTITY FILE: DIVISION
       PRECEDENCE: 5                           ENTITY FILE: SYSTEM
  
    A post-init routine, EDPYP2, has been created to move existing
    ORWOR TIMEOUT CHART and ORWOR TIMEOUT COUNTDOWN parameter values
    into the corresponding EDP APP COUNTDOWN and EDP APP TIMEOUT
    parameters. A default system level setting will be entered as
    2 minutes for the EDP APP COUNTDOWN parameter and 20 minutes for
    the EDP APP TIMEOUT parameter.  User parameter values will only
    be copied over if the user exists in the TRACKING STAFF (#231.7)
    file.
 
 2. HD0000000466332   Excess WEB Error Logic Display
 
    Problem #2:
    -----------
    Many sites have experienced an <UNDEFINED>ACT+22^EDPRPT1 error when
    attempting to run the EDIS Activity report.  This error is caused
    by a flaw in the way the Activity report initialized its counter
    variables.  Specifically, those related to dispositions.  The
    report was using the abbreviation index (^EDPB(233.1,"AB")) for
    the TRACKING CODE (#233.1) file to compile the list of potential
    dispositions.  However, the abbreviation is not required and file
    233.1 is only updated once at the time of creation of the
    disposition.  All future updates to the disposition appear in the
    TRACKING CODE SET (#233.2) file.  This allows for a disposition to
    be created without an abbreviation (no entry in ^EDPB(233.1,"AB")
    index and then later have an abbreviation added which is stored in
    the 233.2 file.  Since the Activity report uses the 233.2 file to
    determine if a disposition abbreviation exists, this causes a
    situation where a counter variable had not been initialized and
    thus an <UNDEFINED> error occurs.
 
    Resolution #2:
    --------------
    Routine EDPRPT1 was modified to compile the list of potential
    disposition abbreviations using both the TRACKING CODE (233.1)
    file and the TRACKING CODE SET (#233.2) file.  This will prevent
    dispositions originally created without an abbreviation from
    causing an <UNDEFINED>ACT+22^EDPRPT1 error if later an
    abbreviation is added.
 
 3. Report issues discovered while researching problem 2 (HD0000000466332)
 
    Problem #3:
    -----------
    1. Some reports failed to count dispositions that were originally
       created without abbreviations or never had an abbreviation.
    2. If no abbreviation and the disposition was counted, the entry
       would display no value in the Disposition column and/or would
       lump them together under "none".
    3. Missed Opportunities and VA Admissions were being under counted
       as only dispositions containing abbreviations in the TRACKING
       CODE (#233.1) file were being counted.
 
    Resolution #3:
    --------------
    Routines EDPRPT, EDPRPT1, EDPRPT10, EDPRPT2, EDPRPT3, EDPRPT4,
    EDPRPT5, EDPRPT7, EDPRPT7C and EDPRPT8 were modified to address the
    three identified issues.  These changes effect the Activity Report,
    the Admissions Report, the Delay Report, the Missed Opportunity
    Report, the Delay Summary Report, the Shift Report, the Exposure
    Report and the Acuity Report.  If a report displays the disposition
    (abbreviation) and the disposition does not have an abbreviation,
    the report will display the first 30 characters of the Display Name
    for the disposition.  Spaces in these Display Names will be
    replaced with underscores.  For example, a Display Name of "Patient
    Left ED Without Treatment" would display as
    "Patient_Left_ED_Without_Treatm".
 
 4. HD0000000489402   Getting EDIS Server Error
 
    Problem #4:
    -----------
    The Server Unavailable error message is displayed in many different
    instances.  It can be an indicator that communications between the
    web browser (EDIS front-end), the EDIS server, and VistA has
    encountered a problem or it can occur because the messaging between
    these three entities has exceeded the maximum time allowed for the
    communication to occur.  The maximum time allowed for EDIS
    communications has been hard coded into the EDIS server software.
    It has been determined that sites have been experiencing a high
    number of Server Unavailable error messages due to the communication
    timeout values being too low.  This has caused sites to experience
    the Server Unavailable error message when attempting to run reports
    as well as when just attempting to use the EDIS application.  As
    these errors can be caused by large data retrieval taking too long
    or be due to general slowness in the network, it has been determined
    that the server software should be modified to allow for longer
    communication timeout periods.
 
    Resolution #4:
    --------------
    It was determined that two separate timeout variables were being
    encountered and causing the Server Unavailable error messages.
    The first timeout variable was the HttpService requestTimeOut
    variable.  This variable determines how long the HttpService would
    wait for a response from the server.  It was initially set at 20
    seconds, which has shown to be too short of a time period to wait
    for a response from the server.  Especially, if running a report
    over a longer time interval that may require more time to compile
    the data in VistA.  This value is being changed to a -1, which will
    effectively set the requestTimeOut to "unlimited".  Thus, the
    HttpService will no longer timeout or cause Server Unavailable
    error messages.  The second timeout variable effects the VistALink
    timeout.  A value of 30 seconds was being used to limit the amount
    of time VistA had to respond to a request from the server.  If
    VistA required more than 30 seconds to compile the data and respond,
    VistALink would throw a timeout error.  As this is also hard coded
    on the EDIS server, this value is also being modified to reduce the
    number of Server Unavailable error messages caused by this timeout.
    The new value for the VistALink timeout is being set at 90 seconds
    which should reduce the number of Server Unavailable error messages
    currently being thrown due to the 30 second timeout.
  
    As these two timeout changes reside on the server, sites will not
    need to install anything on their systems to see these fixes.
    When EDP 2.0 is released, the EDIS servers will
    simultaneously be updated to include the solutions for problem #4.
 
 5. HD0000000500768   Report times are wrong
 
    Problem #5:
    -----------
    The Shift Report covers a period of 24 hours.  However, if you set
    the first shift to start at a time other than midnight (0:00), then
    the report fails to calculate shifts past midnight up to the start
    shift time.  What displays is a shift starting before midnight and
    then going until the start time of the first shift.  For example,
    if the start time is 8:00 and the shift durations are 8 hours the
    report column headers will look like:
 
       8:00 to 16:00          16:00 to 8:00
 
    As the column headers show, there are only two shifts identified
    instead of the three as you would expect with the second shift
    displaying as 16 hours in duration. 
 
    Resolution #5:
    --------------
    Routine EDPRPT5 was modified to correctly handle shifts that extend
    past midnight when the first shift start time is something other
    than midnight (0:00).  Using the example from the problem
    description the column headers will now display three columns of
    data:
 
       8:00 to 16:00          16:00 to 0:00          0:00 to 8:00
 
 6. HD0000000498267   EDIS Reports has 4 columns instead of 12 columns
 
    Problem #6:
    -----------
    It was discovered the Shift report would only display 4 columns
    (shifts) worth of data, even if there were more shifts than this.
    The additional shifts would display the columns in the report,
    but they would be blank.  The exported version of the Shift
    report would display all shifts properly.  It was also discovered
    the data being returned from VistA could only handle 13 unique
    columns worth of data.  More than 13 shifts in a day could produce
    duplicate data in every column after column 12 in the exported
    Shift report and in the display if it was showing data in all the
    columns.
  
    Resolution #6:
    --------------
    Routine EDPRPT5 was modified to return up to 24 unique data columns
    in order to handle a one hour shift duration setting.  The server
    EAR file is also being modified to limit the shift duration
    parameter setting to a minimum of one hour and a maximum of 24
    hours.  The Shift report will now properly show up to 24 columns
    worth of data when displayed to the screen or exported to a file.
 
 7. Shift report issues
  
    Problem #7:
    -----------
    While testing changes related to the shift report, issues 5 and 6
    above, it was discovered there were three additional items which
    required attention.  First, it was noticed the exported shift report
    was shifting the last shift displayed on the shift report to the
    first column making it the first shift on the report.  Second, the
    date/time indicated in the header is not always accurate.  If the
    "First shift begins at" parameter is set to 00:00, then the header
    is accurate.  However, if the "First shift begins at" parameter is
    set to any other value, the report actually runs from the
    previous day at the time of the start of the last shift.  For
    example, if the shift duration is set for 12 hours and the "First
    shift begins at" parameter is set to 07:00, and the shift report
    is run for 7/25/2011 then the report will run from 7/24/2011@19:00
    to 7/25/2011@19:00.  This makes the current header display
    inaccurate.  Thirdly, we noticed some problems with the way the
    report was calculating some of the data to display.  Most notably
    the "Carried over at Report Start" and the "Carry over to Next
    Shift" fields.
 
    Resolution #7:
    --------------
    Routine EDPRPT5 is being modified to correct the "Carried over at
    Report Start" and the "Carry over to Next Shift" fields in the
    Shift report.  It is also adjusting the way the report determines
    the start date/time for the report to run.  Currently, when the
    "First shift begins at" parameter is greater than 00:00, then the
    report starts one day earlier and at the start time of the last
    calculated shift of the day.  The new start time will be modified
    to be the same as the "First shift begins at" time of the previous
    day.  The server, EAR file, will be modified to display an
    appropriate header and report from/to date times to match the new
    report start time so the users will see the correct report range
    being displayed.  The server modifications will also address the
    moving of the last shift to the first column when exported.

INSTALLATION:
==============
 
Pre - Installation Instructions:
--------------------------------
**************************************************************************
 
This software will be a phased release.  The EDIS Implementation Team    
will contact sites prior to installation so they can complete several
pre-install steps.  Sites should not install the EDIS 2.0 software until
the checklist has been completed and verified by the EDIS Implementation 
Team.
**************************************************************************
 
The software will be available for installation/ implementation upon 
completion and verification of the pre-install checklist that will be 
distributed in phases by the Implementation Team. Sites will be set up on 
the National Server for EDIS access based on the implementation 
schedule.  Upon setup and access to the National Server, sites will be 
able to test and then move into production.

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------
This Host File may be installed with users on the system although it is 
recommended that it be installed during non-peak hours and that all EDIS 
users log out of the system to minimize potential disruption to users and 
data.  This Host File Build should take less than 5 minutes to install.
 
No menu options need to be disabled for this installation.
Time to configure the application parameters will vary by site depending 
on site preparation. Due to configurations being completed for EDIS 
v1.0,setup should be minimal. The Version 2.0 build is backwards 
compatible with EDIS version 1.0, but do not install version 2.0 until 
your IM team has contacted you.
 
 
Installation should take less than 5 minutes.
