Subject: FIX FOR GENERAL ERRORS IN PROBLEM LIST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1. A diagnosis entered on the Diagnosis Tab of the Encounter Form on the 
 Notes Tab of CPRS GUI is not added to the problem list for inpatients
 whose hospital location type is "Clinic".
  
 2. A CPRS GUI user at a non-VA site entering a new problem list item while
 entering an encounter for a patient will generate an undefined variable 
 error when saving the form. This will cause all of the just entered data
 for the encounter to not be saved.
