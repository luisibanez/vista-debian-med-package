Subject: IHTA 5.0.0 Released 

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch is to announce that the IHTA 5.0.0 updates to 
 the Integrated Home Telehealth Application (IHTA) will be nationally 
 rolled out the weekend of March 30, 2013, beginning at 9:00 PM ET on 
 March 29.
  
 IHTA 5.0.0 builds on the current IHTA 4.5.0 release with enhancements to 
 the Disease Management Protocol (DMP) module and the Manage Quality 
 Improvement Report (QIR) functionality of the Inventory Tracker module.
  
 The first of these enhancements is the addition of functionality that 
 allows reviewers of Veteran Health Administration (VHA)-written DMP 
 content to add their comments on specific DMP content in one central 
 location in IHTA, reducing the amount of time DMP facilitators spend 
 managing the feedback on DMP content from multiple reviewers from various 
 sources.
  
 Also included in this release is the addition of an export to Excel 
 feature in the Manage QIR functionality of Inventory Tracker that will 
 allow administrators to export a list of all QIRs submitted in IHTA.
 IHTA is a Web-based portal application sponsored by the VHA Office of 
 Telehealth Services (OTS).  IHTA is designed to provide a flexible, 
 maintainable, and resilient platform for Home Telehealth (HT) business 
 functions.  Each business function supported by IHTA is constructed as an 
 application module of IHTA.  IHTA 5.0.0 includes the following modules:  
 My Profile, Administration, Inventory Tracker, which includes the Manage 
 QIR functionality, and DMP Development Process.  Details on each module 
 are provided below:
 - Inventory Tracker: Designed to enable Care Coordinators and Program 
 Support Assistants (PSA) to generate reports on device availability and 
 vendor compliance.  Reports can be saved for later viewing in native, 
 Excel, and PDF formats.  To round out this module, three searches provide 
 the capability to search for home devices/appliances based on serial 
 number, activation date, and patient name.  
 - Manage QIRs: Inventory Tracker also contains the Manage QIR 
 functionality, which allows Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) 
 staff to electronically submit, process, track, and print QIRs that 
 document quality and patient safety issues related to HT devices.  This 
 functionality replaces the legacy VA Reporting and Processing Medical 
 Materiel Complaints/ Quality Improvement Report form (VA Form 0729).
 - Administration: Provides IHTA administrators with the ability to 
 approve or reject registrations and assign roles to users.  This module 
 also allows administrators to manage and schedule batch jobs (i.e., 
 Weekly Vendor Compliance Report E-mail, Purge Completed Reports, Vendor 
 Response Due Date).
 - DMP Development Process: Provides DMP Administrators and assigned VHA 
 Subject Matter Experts (SME) with the ability to create and update DMPs 
 and their associated clinician alerts and patient health information in a 
 Web-based development tool.
 - My Profile: Allows the user to view his/her system information and 
 adjust personal application settings.
