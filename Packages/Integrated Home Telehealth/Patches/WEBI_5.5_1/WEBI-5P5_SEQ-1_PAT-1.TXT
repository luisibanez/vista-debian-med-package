Description:
============

 This informational patch is to announce that the IHTA 5.5.0 updates to 
 the Integrated Home Telehealth Application (IHTA) will be nationally 
 rolled out the evening of Monday, September 30, beginning at 9:00 PM ET.
  
 IHTA 5.5.0 builds on the current IHTA 5.0.0 release with enhancements to 
 the Disease Management Protocol (DMP) module and the Manage Quality 
 Improvement Report (QIR) functionality of the Inventory Tracker module.  
 Enhancements to the Manage QIR functionality of the Inventory Tracker 
 module includes the addition of two new fields to the electronic QIR that 
 will allow National Administrators to track whether the QIR is related to 
 a VHA-written or Vendor DMP.  Additional UI enhancements to the export a 
 list of all QIRs to Excel functionality will also be included in this 
 release.  
  
 Also included in this release is the addition of the new Home Telehealth 
 (HT) Reports module of IHTA.  The HT Reports module will allow users to 
 search on aggregate DMP response data from the Health Data Repository 
 (HDR) to produce and export to Excel management-level DMP Response 
 Reports, including the following:
  
 Number of Patients by DMP
 Number of Patients by DMP and VISN
 Number of Patients by DMP and Facility
 Number of Patients by DMP and Vendor
 Number of Patients by DMP, VISN and Vendor
 Number of Patients by DMP, Facility and Vendor.
  
 IHTA is a Web-based portal application sponsored by the VHA Office of 
 Telehealth Services (OTS).  IHTA is designed to provide a flexible, 
 maintainable, and resilient platform for Home Telehealth (HT) business 
 functions.  Each business function supported by IHTA is constructed as an 
 application module of IHTA.  IHTA 5.5.0 includes the following modules:  
 My Profile, Administration, Inventory Tracker, which includes the Manage 
 QIR functionality, DMP Development Process, and HT Reports.  Details on 
 each module are provided below:
 Inventory Tracker: Designed to enable Care Coordinators and Program 
 Support Assistants (PSA) to generate reports on device availability and 
 vendor compliance.  Reports can be saved for later viewing in native, 
 Excel, and PDF formats.  To round out this module, three searches provide 
 the capability to search for home devices/appliances based on serial 
 number, activation date, and patient name.  
  -Manage QIRs: Inventory Tracker also contains the Manage QIR 
 functionality, which allows Care Coordination/Home Telehealth (CCHT) 
 staff to electronically submit, process, track, and print QIRs that 
 document quality and patient safety issues related to HT devices.  This 
 functionality replaces the legacy VA Reporting and Processing Medical 
 Materiel Complaints/ Quality Improvement Report form (VA Form 0729).
 Administration: Provides IHTA administrators with the ability to approve 
 or reject registrations and assign roles to users.  This module also 
 allows administrators to manage and schedule batch jobs (i.e., Weekly 
 Vendor Compliance Report E-mail, Purge Completed Reports, Vendor Response 
 Due Date).
 DMP Development Process: Provides DMP Administrators and assigned VHA 
 Subject Matter Experts (SME) with the ability to create and update DMPs 
 and their associated clinician alerts and patient health information in a 
 Web-based development tool.
 HT Reports: Provides Home Telehealth management with the ability to 
 search on aggregate DMP response data from the Health Data Repository 
 (HDR) to produce and export to Excel various reports.
 My Profile: Allows the user to view his/her system information and adjust 
 personal application settings.
  
 Intended users of IHTA include National, Veterans Integrated Service 
 Network (VISN) and Facility Administrators, Care Coordinators, PSAs, 
 Program Office Managers, National Home Telehealth Training Center (NHTTC) 
 staff, and VHA SMEs.
