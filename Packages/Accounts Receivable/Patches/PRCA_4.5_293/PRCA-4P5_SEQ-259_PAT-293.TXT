Subject: HIPAA 5010 D.0 Level II Phase 2

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The HIPAA 5010 D.0 Level II Phase 2 project includes the following
 modifications to the Electronic Payments V. 4.5 application:
  
 1. Duplicate Receipt Numbers
    -------------------------
    Modified VistA to create a unique receipt number for the user when
    creating a receipt in order to post payments without manual
    intervention. Previously, it was possible for VistA to create an
    already used receipt number and this would cause the user to re-enter
    data because VistA did not recognize the duplicate receipt number
    until later in the creation of receipt process.
  
 2. Manual Receipts - EFT Selection
    -------------------------------
    Modified VistA so that the user is unable to select a MATCHED EFT
    when performing the Manual Match EFT-ERA. Due to this modification the
    user will NOT be able to see or select a MATCHED EFT when using the
    MANUALLY MATCH EFT-ERA [RCDPE MANUAL MATCH EFT-ERA] option.
  
    Once the match is made, the EFT will NOT be listed on the Unmatched
    Aging Report.
  
 3. EFT Unmatched Aging Report & ERA Unmatched Aging Reports
    --------------------------------------------------------
    Modified VistA so that only non-duplicate EFTs that are unmatched and
    have a payment amount greater than zero appear on the EFT Unmatched
    Aging Report.  VistA was also modified so that only non-duplicate ERAs
    that are unmatched and have a payment amount greater than zero appear
    on the ERA Unmatched Aging Report.
  
 4. Unapplied EFT Deposit Report
    ---------------------------
    Modified VistA to prevent duplicate EFTs from displaying on the
    Unapplied EFT Deposit Report.
