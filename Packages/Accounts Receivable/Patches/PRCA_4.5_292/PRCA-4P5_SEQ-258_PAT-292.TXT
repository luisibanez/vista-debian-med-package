 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 HD0000000728230 AR DATA not transmitting
  
 Problem:
 --------
  
 Site reported that the Data Extract files generated for the Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA) CBO were unable to transfer using File
 Transfer Protocol (FTP) to the Allocation Resource Center (ARC)
 automatically after the site migrated to a full Linux operating system.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 Modified routines RCXVFTP and RCXVFTC to perform valid FTP commands for 
 a full Linux operating system environment.
  
  
 Pre-installation Instructions:
 ==============================
                 
 IMPORTANT NOTE - for Linux based systems:
 Prior to installation, sites should identify a directory to which Taskman 
 has full read/write access.  It is recommended that you use the same HFS 
 directory as specified in the PRIMARY HFS DIRECTORY field (#320) of the 
 KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3).  For Linux based systems, this 
 should have the form /srv/vista/scd/user/hfs/ (where scd is the 3 letter 
 site code). You will need to enter this into the VITRIA STANDARD DIRECTORY
 field (#20.01) of the AR SITE PARAMETER file (#342) using Fileman. Note
 that the preceding and trailing slash ('/') in the directory name is
 important.  
  
 Example:
 Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES  
  
 INPUT TO WHAT FILE: AR SITE PARAMETER// 342  AR SITE PARAMETER
                                           (1 entry)
 EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL// 20.01  VITRIA STANDARD DIRECTORY
 THEN EDIT FIELD: 
  
 Select AR SITE PARAMETER: `1  EL PASO VA HCS
 VITRIA STANDARD DIRECTORY: /srv/vista/elp/user/hfs/
            Replace
  
  
 IMPORTANT NOTE - for non-Linux based systems:
 No changes should be made to the directory or AR Site Parameter file at 
 this time.  If you convert to a Linux based system in the future, you will
 need to remember to follow the instructions for Linux based systems.
  
  
 ALL SITES:
 Please add yourself to the existing Mail Group specified by the MAIL GROUP
 field (#20.02) of the AR SITE PARAMETER file (#342) (i.e. RCXVFTP).  This 
 Mail Group will receive any FTP or other extract related failure messages.
