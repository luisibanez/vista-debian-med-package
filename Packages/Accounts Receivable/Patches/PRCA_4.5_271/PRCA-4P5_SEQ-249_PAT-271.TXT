Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*359
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*435
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*10
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*271
  
 The four patches (PSO*7*359, IB*2*435, BPS*1*10, and PRCA*4.5*271) are 
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB PRCA BUNDLE 6.0.  For more specific
 instructions please refer to the installation steps provided in each of
 the patches.
  
 For the pharmacy claims that are processed electronically, the ePharmacy 
 module is currently compliant with the National Council for Prescription 
 Drug Programs (NCPDP) industry standards for version 5.1. NCPDP version 
 D.0 Level 1 compliance (completion of internal testing) must be in place 
 by January 1, 2011, and it must have completed external testing with 
 payers and be in production as of January 1, 2012. Meeting the deliverable
 dates is essential to VHA meeting this legislative mandate and for
 continued business with pharmacy payers. As part of these changes, VHA
 should also have backwards compatibility to the NCPDP version 5.1 to allow
 for continued revenue and processing of VHA pharmacy claims.
  
 The combined build will allow the processing and release of prescriptions 
 for patients with Insurance payers that use the new NCPDP version D.0 
 format for electronic claims processing as well as the current NCPDP
 version 5.1 format.
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------

     patch makes modifications to AR routines to accommodate a longer
     ECME number.

 Documentation Retrieval:
 ------------------------
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
  
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
  
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a
      specific server as follows:
  
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.
  
 The documentation distribution includes:
  
     FILE NAME                             DESCRIPTION

        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Do not queue the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
 Install Time
 ------------
 The installation will take between 10 and 90 minutes depending upon how
 many entries your site has in the BPS CLAIMS file (9002313.02) and in the
 BPS RESPONSES file (9002313.03).  Data conversions will be run in both
 files and all entries will be checked during the installation of BPS*1*10.
  
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID, which contains the
     following patches:
  
         BPS*1.0*10
         PSO*7.0*359
         IB*2.0*435
         PRCA*4.5*271
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID host file is located in the 
      anonymous.software directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the
      file.
