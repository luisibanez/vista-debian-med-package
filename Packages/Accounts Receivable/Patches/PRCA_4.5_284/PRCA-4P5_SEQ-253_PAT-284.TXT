Description:
============

 This patch includes enhancements (as requested by CBO), and Remedy Tickets
 submitted to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE application. Enhancement/repair
 descriptions, and installation steps are described below.
  
  
 1. Mark ERA option changes 
    -----------------------
  Per CBO request the Mark ERA Returned to Payer option was replaced with 
  the new option - Remove ERA from Worklist.  The latter option will 
  implement the software procedures as the former option. There were 
  minor changes to this existing software, but the functionality will 
  essentially behave the same. The following modifications have been made:
  
    a. The following option (Old) attached in the EDI Lockbox [RCDPE EDI 
       LOCKBOX MENU] menu was replaced (New):
  
    Old: Mark ERA Returned To Payer [RCDPE ERA RETURNED TO PAYER]
    New: Remove ERA from Active Worklist [RCDPE REMOVE ERA FROM WORKLIST]
  
    b. The following option (Old) attached in the EDI Lockbox Reports 
       Menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX REPORTS MENU] menu was replaced (New):
  
    Old: Mark ERAs Returned to Payer Audit Report [RCDPE RETURNED ERA
         AUDIT]
    New: Remove ERA from Active Worklist Audit Report [RCDPE REMOVED 
         ERA AUDIT]
  
    c. When the user selects an ERA to be removed from the EEOB Worklist 
       with the use of the Mark ERA from Active Worklist option, the EFT
       MATCH STATUS for the ERA entry is updated to REMOVED FROM WORKLIST
       (refer to item d below for associated data dictionary change).
  
  
    d. The following fields defined in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE 
       file (#344.4) were modified to reflect the option name change from
       "RETURNED" to "REMOVED":
        
    -  EFT MATCH STATUS (344.4,.09) - new SET OF CODES item was added.
       4-REMOVED FROM WORKLIST
    -  DETAIL POST STATUS (#344.4,.14) - a SET OF CODES description 
       was modified.  4-NOT POSTED-RETURNED was changed to 4-NOT
       POSTED-REMOVED
    -  RETURNED BY was changed to REMOVED BY (#344.4,.16)
    -  RETURNED DATED was changed to REMOVED DATE (#344. 4,.17)
    -  RETURN REASON was changed to REMOVE REASON (#344.4,.18)
  
 2. Correction to the Claims Matching Report 
    ----------------------------------------
    Identified in Remedy ticket HD0000000594126 - a modification to the
    Claims Matching Report [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH] option has been made to
    correct the undefined error (<UNDEFINED> HDR+4^RCDPRTP1 *RCPT) that
    occurs during printing when the 'Receipt  Number' option (#4) is
    chosen.
  
    Remedy ticket HD0000000600366 identified another issue affecting the 
    Claims Matching Report [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH]: an undefined error while
    executing the Payment Dates selection (#3) for the report. 
    Modifications have been made to correct the undefined error.
   
 3. Modification to locate 3rd Party claims with EEOB's 
    ---------------------------------------------------
    Identified in remedy ticket HD0000000597554 - it was determined that
    patches IB*2.0*451 and PRCA*4.5*276 added the ability to identify, via
    a '%' indicator, first party bills with associated third party bills
    with EEOB's on file. The code to locate these utilized the 399,"D"
    (bills by date) index. It was found that these changes substantially
    slowed down the display of the corresponding reports to unsatisfactory
    levels. The functions that drive the report now utilize the 399,"APDT" 
    (bills by patient by date) index to speed it up.
  
    Accounts Receivable namespace options affected
    ----------------------------------------------
    Brief Account Profile   [PRCAY ACCOUNT PROFILE]      
    Full Account Profile    [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE]    
    List All Bills          [PRCA LIST ALL BILLS]   
    Bill Profile            [RCDP BILL PROFILE] 
    Bill Transactions       [RCDP BILL TRANSACTIONS]
    Transaction Profile     [RCDP TRANSACTION PROFILE]
    Transaction Profile     [PRCAC TRANS PROFILE]
   
 4. Update ERA Posted Using Paper EOB default change 
    ------------------------------------------------
    When an automatic update is performed on an ERA, the default response
    to the prompt 'Link to update Remittance entry #xxx with receipt xxx?'
    has been changed from "YES" to "NO". This modification helps prevent
    accidental updates.
  
 5. Correction to printed EDI Lockbox reports
    -----------------------------------------
    It was reported by the test sites that the Daily Activity, 
    ERA Unmatched Aging & EFT Unmatched Aging reports
    when queued for printing returned no results. It was also
    determined that this issue was only occurring on sites with a
    particular server set-up that prevented the background job accessing 
    the saved global references that had been recorded during user 
    input selection at the start of the report.  The particular server
    configuration for sites that reported the issue have multiple 
    nodes and the VistA logon may reside on a different node than the
    the node the print tasks are performed on. 
  
 6. Correction to the Daily Activity Report
    ---------------------------------------
    Identified during field testing - it was determined that ERA# would be
    truncated if it was longer than 7 characters. Changes were made to
    allow for the full 10 characters. 
   
 7. Correction to RECEIPT PROCESSING
    --------------------------------
    Identified by test sites - when adding a new receipt for an EDI Lockbox
    type payment, the user was allowed to select an EFT record that had 
    already been matched to an ERA record.  Changes were made to prevent
    selection of EFT records that are in a matched status. 
  
    The following field defined in the AR BATCH PAYMENT file (#344) was 
    modified to reflect the input transform code change.
        
    -  EFT RECORD (344,.17) - input transform modified.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD0000000594126 - <UNDEFINED>HDR+4^RCDPRTP1 *RCPT
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reported a <UNDEFINED>HDR+4^RCDPRTP1 error occurred when
 trying to run the Claims Matching Report option.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When printing the Claims Matching Report with the 'Receipt Number'
 option (#4) selected, the routine 'NEWs' the original receipt number
 variable RCPT (which holds the number the user had selected), thus
 killing it. When the reports header attempts to display the receipt#
 an undefined error occurs.
  
 Modified routine RCDPRTP1 to remove the variable RCPT from the NEW
 variable line.
  
  
 2. HD0000000600366 - <UNDEFINED>PROC+16^RCDPRTP1 ^TMP("IBRBT")
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reported an undefined error when executing Claims Matching 
 Report, Option #3 (Payment Dates). 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Troubleshooting led to the routine RCDPRTP1, tag PROCQ where the 
 ^TMP global was being cleaned up improperly. Modified the routine to
 accomplish cleaning up the global correctly.
 
  
 3. HD0000000597554
 
 Problem:
 --------
 Sites reported that reports modified in patches IB*2.0*451 and PRCA*4.5*276
 to display first party bills with associated third party bills substantially
 slowed down the display of the corresponding reports to unsatisfactory levels. 
 
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The functions that drive the report now utilize the 399,"APDT" (bills by
 patient by date) index to speed it up.
 
  
 Test Sites:
 ----------
 Birmingham
 Louisville
 Martinsburg
 New Jersey HCS
