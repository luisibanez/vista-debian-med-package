Subject: AR - 5010 ENHANCEMENTS

Category:

  - Other

Description:
============

 The Chief Business Office (CBO) requested enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA)'s Veterans Health Integrated Systems 
 Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party Electronic Data Interchange 
 (EDI) Lockbox module ePayments Enhancement project. These enhancements
 will increase timely and accurate processing of payments in compliance
 with Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 
 VHA fiscal accounting policies. 
  
 Currently to perform the Accounts Receivable (AR) functions, Veterans 
 Administration Medical Center (VAMC) staff is performing manual 
 workarounds to address limitations of the existing software tools. 
 Addressing ePayments software issues will enable compliance with HIPAA 
 security and administrative regulations as well as VHA Fiscal Accounting 
 policy. 
  
 The project has two patches (PRCA*4.5*269 and IB*2*431) which are being
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi
 build distribution EPAYMENTS_5010.KID.  
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*269
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*431
  
 Changes made to the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE application and installation steps
 are described below. See IB*2*431 for changes made to INTEGRATED BILLING 
 application.
  
 HIPAA 5010 changes
 ------------------
 Modifications are made to the EDI Lockbox menu to allow VistA to receive, 
 process and display ERA, EFT and EEOB data from FSC in HIPAA 5010
 compatible format. Backward compatibility is supported to allow VistA to
 also receive messages in the existing HIPAA 4010 format.
  
 The data content of ERA, EFT and EEOB messages is modified to meet HIPAA 
 5010 standard. Existing EFT/ERA Payer Name, Trace #, Contact Numbers,
 Rendering Provider and Adjustment Reference fields are extended in length
 and a new ERA field 'Payer Web Site Address' is also introduced.
  
 These expanded fields in the 835 messages are also stored in VistA and 
 this requires that the database is reorganized. The following fields are 
 unchanged, but moved to new locations in the VistA database to make space
 for the extended fields:
  
    ERA - Check #, Rendering Provider Comment and Adjustment Text fields
    EFT - ACH Trace # and Manual TR Document fields
                                                                        
 This data reorganization is performed as part of the post install routine
 for this patch.
  
 Other Changes
 -------------
 Additional system modifications (outside of HIPAA 5010) are included which
 will enable automation of the labor intensive workarounds and minimize
 costly system errors.
  
 1) The PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS batch job auto matches EFT and ERA 
    transactions and updates receipts for the AR package. This process 
    includes a purge of receipts which is extended by this release from 
    one year's retention to seven years.
  
 2) The process for receiving EFT messages is modified to verify on date as
    well as ticket number. This allows 469 and 569 3rd Party ticket number
    ranges to be reused without being treated as duplicates.
  
 3) Minimum dollar amount of zero is enforced in Worklist adjustments.
  
 4) ERA numbers are no longer truncated in Worklist but are now displayed
    as the full 10 digits.
  
 5) 'Patient Charge Maintenance' option in the Worklist/Research Menu 
     is replaced by the 'Administrative Charge Adjustment' option. 
  
 6) Within TPJI (menu option [IBJI THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]) the 
    Comment History sub option is modified to display contact details 
    (including the new Payer Web Site field).

 Documentation Retrieval
 -----------------------
  
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
   
  1.  The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
      download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from the
      first available FTP server.
   
  2.  Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a 
      specific server as follows:
   
      Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
  3.  Documentation can also be retrieved from the VistA Documentation 
      Library (VDL) on the Internet at the following address,
      http://www.va.gov/vdl.
   
 The documentation distribution includes:

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named 
 PRCAP269. The purpose of the post install routine is to move data 
 in the ELECTRONIC REMITTANCE ADVICE file (344.4) and the 
 EDI THIRD PARTY EFT DETAIL file (344.31) to new locations within
 the files specified in the released data dictionary changes. This 
 process runs in foreground and will take several minutes to run on
 larger sites.
  
 On completion a bulletin is sent to the installer with the number of
 entries moved. A further bulletin is sent to VHA CBO ePay 5010 mail
 group on Outlook to notify CBO that the install is complete and the
 site is ready to receive 835 transactions with HIPAA 5010 format data.
  
 The post-install routine is not deleted.
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ================= 
  
 THIS PATCH MUST BE LOADED AFTER NORMAL WORKING HOURS. Extensive 
 changes are made to Accounts Receivable so it should not be in use 
 during the install. 
  
 The install should take approximately 10 minutes.
  
 It is important to make sure that all Accounts Receivable users are logged
 off the system BEFORE INSTALLATION of this patch. You must also disable the
