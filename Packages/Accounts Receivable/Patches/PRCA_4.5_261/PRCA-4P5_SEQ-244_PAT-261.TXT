 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1.  HD0000000258731 - <NOLINE>RUN+3^ZTMS3
  
     Problem:
     --------
     Site reported a <NOLINE>RUN+3^ZTMS3 error occurred when queuing the 
     AR - Print ERA Discrepancy Report from Worklist.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------
     When queuing the AR - Print ERA Discrepancy Report from Worklist by 
     using EEOB Worklist [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX WORKLIST] option, it calls
     DISRPT^RCDPEV. But, Routine RCDPEV does not have the line tag DISRPT.
  
     Modified routine RCDPEV0 to replace the routine name RCDPEV for the
     line tag DISRPT with RCDPEV0.
