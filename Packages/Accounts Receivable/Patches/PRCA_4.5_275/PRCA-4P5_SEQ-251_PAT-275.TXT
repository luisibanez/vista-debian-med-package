Description:
============

 This combined Integrated Billing (IB) and Accounts Receivable (AR) patch 
 expands the HIPAA 5010 enhancements introduced in patch IB*2.0*432.
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
 1. Modify the Third Party Joint Inquiry option [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT
    INQUIRY] to allow up to 10 characters of an inactive claim number to
    display.
  
 2. Modify the Full Account Profile option [PRCAY FULL ACCOUNT PROFILE] to
    allow up to 10 characters of an inactive claim number to display.
  
 3. Create the processes to support the receipt, storage and display of
    Medicare deductible information from Trailblazer Health care
    Enterprise.
  
 4. Create a new option called the Medicare Deductible Alert Worklist [PRCA
    MDA WORKLIST] from which users can view Medicare deductible 
    information.
  
 5. Create a new MDA Mail Group that will receive the incoming MDA data 
    and initiate a server process to store the data. A mail group
    coordinator will need to be assigned.  This is usually the Accounts
    Receivable Supervisor.
