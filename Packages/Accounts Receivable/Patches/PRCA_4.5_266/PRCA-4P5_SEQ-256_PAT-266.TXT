 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000714329 - Revenue source codes - Non-health care debt
   
 Problem:
 --------
 The office of VHA Chief Financial Officer (10A3) - Office Resources
 Management (10A3B) has requested that this change take place:
 inactivate one (1) existing revenue source code and add five (5) new CWT
 related revenue source codes to the REVENUE SOURCE CODE (#347.3) file.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch updates the REVENUE SOURCE CODE (#347.3) file for the following
 5 codes, as indicated:
  
 CODE    NAME
  
 8CW1    CWT SHELTERED WORKSHOPS
 8CW2    CWT/TRANS WORK EXP (VAMC)
 8CW3    CWT/TWE (FED NOT VAMC)
 8CW4    CWT/TRANS WORK EXP (NON FEDERAL)
 8CW5    CWT/VETERANS CONSTRUCTION TEAM
  
 In addition, revenue source code 8023 (COMPENSATED WORK THERAPY) needs to 
 be inactivated in the same file. (The use of Compensated Work Therapy as a
 revenue source is being disaggregated into the above five new codes.)
  
 The previous use of the 8023 code already on the ACCOUNTS 
 RECEIVABLE (#430) file needs to stay that way.
  
 A post-init routine PRCAP266 is created to add the above referenced five
 revenue source codes to the REVENUE SOURCE CODE (#347.3) file and
 inactivate code 8023 on that table file.
  
 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 This patch should be installed after normal business hours, when all 
 Accounts Receivable users are logged off the system.
  
 Ensure that the PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS is NOT running while installing this 
 patch.
  
 The post-init routine PRCAP266 can be deleted after installation.
