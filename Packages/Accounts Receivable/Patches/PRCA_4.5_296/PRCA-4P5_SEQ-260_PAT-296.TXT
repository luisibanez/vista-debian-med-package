Subject: LOCKBOX CHANGE REQUEST

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues.
  
 The first issue contains two changes to the Automatic Payment Process Server
 [RCDP AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS] option that processes deposit files containing 
 records of veterans' cash and check payments of their copayment bills to 
 the national Lockbox. VistA Accounts Receivable (AR) will begin to receive
 new types of deposit files that represent withholdings of VA Compensation
 and Pension (C&P) benefits or amounts owed to the veteran by the US
 Treasury. They are then applied to veterans' delinquent accounts in the 
 same manner as cash/check payments.
  
 The second issue is about the account lookup keys which will be included
 in the new Treasury and Compensation & Pension (C&P) withholding deposit
 files to identify the correct veteran in VistA.
  
 Note *** This patch will allow VistA Accounts Receivable to accept 
 automated TOP (Treasury Offset Program) and C&P (Compensation and 
 Pension) files sent from the DMC.  DMC files are generally sent between 
 the 20-25th of each month so installing this patch before then will 
 greatly reduce the amount of work required for your accounting staff.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000817917 Accounts Receivable - Lockbox
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested two changes to the
  Automatic Payment Process Server [RCDP AUTOMATIC PAYMENTS] option in
  order to process new types of deposit files that will be transmitted to
  VistA AR from Debt Management Center (DMC) systems.
  
  1. Utilize specific letters for the system-generated receipt number for
     receipts that store the veterans' withholdings to designate the
     deposit file type as detailed below:
  
     Deposit File Type          Deposit # Prefix        1st Letter Receipt #
     ------------------------   ----------------        --------------------
     DMC (C&P) Offset                  168                      A
     Treasury Offset                   169                      T
     Other (Cross-Servicing)           170                      P
  
  2. Suppress the generation of the Cash Receipt document (usually sent to
     the Financial Management System) for deposit files that represent:
     (1) Treasury Offset amounts, (2) Compensation & Pension (C&P)
     withholdings, or (3) Other Collections through the Cross-Servicing
     program.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  1. Routine RCDPXPAP was modified to retrieve the event number from the
     file (#341.1) based on the structures as listed below and pass it into
     the function for the generation of the first letter of the receipt 
     number.
  
     - When the deposit number begins with '168' (DMC (C&P)), the event  
       number is 15 for the 'ADMINISTRATIVE OFFSET' event type.
     - When the deposit number begins with '169' (Treasury Offset), the event
       number is 13 for the 'TOP PAYMENT' event type.
     - When the deposit number begins with '170' (Other (Crossing-Servicing),
       the event number is 16 for the 'PRIVATE COLLECTION AGENCY' event type.
  
  In addition, post-init routine PRCAP296 was created to add two new event
  types for'DMC (C&P)' offset and 'Other (Cross-Servicing)' offset to the 
  AR Event Type file (#341.1). Routine PRCABJV was also modified to add
  these new event types in file verification for the [PRCA NIGHTLY PROCESS]
  Accounts Receivable Nightly Process Background Job option.
  
     Name                             Event Number           Category
     ----------------------------     ------------           --------
     ADMINISTRATIVE OFFSET                15                 PAYMENT
     PRIVATE COLLECTION AGENCY            16                 PAYMENT
  
  2. Routine RCDPURE1 was modified to suppress the generation of the Cash 
     Receipt (CR) document for those above event types of receipts.
  
 2. INC000000850561 Treasury/Lockbox/C&P Deposit issue
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The CBO has requested proper utilization of account lookup keys for the
  new Treasury and Compensation & Pension (C&P) withholding deposit files
  to identify the correct veteran in VistA. The account lookup key is a
  14-character string that consists of the veteran's social security
  number, followed by 5 alpha and punctuation characters that represent the
  veteran's name. The 5 alpha and punctuation characters have the following
  representations:
  
  1. Lockbox deposit file:  Characters are the first five characters of the
     the veteran's last name, including any punctuation characters that are
     part of that name. This account lookup is currently in use in VistA.
  
  2. Treasury deposit file:  Characters are the first five characters of the
     veteran's last name, excluding any punctuation characters that are part
     of that name.
  
  3. C&P deposit file:  First position represents the first character of the
     veteran's first name; second position represents the veteran's middle
     initial (or a space character if there is no middle initial); last
     three positions represents the first three characters of the veteran's
     last name, excluding any punctuation characters that are part of that
     name.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The account lookup function $$FINDACCT in routine RCDPXPAP was modified to
  use the representations to check each of the three deposit files and
  return the associated internal number of the veteran to update the account.
  
  It also fixed a bug to identify the correct veteran when the account lookup
  key for the current Lockbox deposit file contains any punctuation
  characters that are part of the veteran's last name.
