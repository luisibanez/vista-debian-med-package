Subject: THIRD PARTY PHARMACY ENHANCEMENT

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 
 
     ****    PLEASE NOTE:  the compliance date is April 26, 2011  ***
 
 
 Currently, the VHA bills a $51 flat rate per prescription to third party
 payers for outpatient prescriptions. This rate does not vary based on the
 number of days for the prescription or the drug provided.
 VHA requested a modification to the federal regulations to change the
 methodology for third party pharmacy charges to allow VHA to charge a rate
 based on the cost of the drugs plus administrative fee instead of a flat
 rate for rate types No Fault Auto Acc, Reimburs Health Ins, Tort Feasor, and
 Workman's Comp. In addition, a new fund account and four new Revenue Source
 Codes were created to specifically capture the third party pharmacy billing
 and accounts receivable in VistA.
  
 This patch contains functionality for the new fund account (528711) and
 Revenue Source Codes. Patch IB*2*437 addresses the rate change and must be 
 installed prior to loading this patch.

 2. The Deposit Reconciliation Report [PRCA DEPOSIT RECON REPORT] will print a
 report showing the cash receipt documents sent to FMS.  The user can print a
 summary or detailed report. The summary report will show the total cash
 receipt dollars sent to FMS. The detail report will show the individual
 lines in the cash receipt document sent to FMS. 
  
 The report has been modified to display the new fund for Third Party
 Pharmacy and the four new Revenue Source Codes.
  
 3.  The option to calculate the Revenue Source Code for a Bill is [PRCA FMS
 RSC CALCULATE]. This option will calculate the Revenue Source Code for a
 MCCF (fund 5287) bill and display it on the screen.  The code will be
 modified so the four new Revenue Source Codes will calculate and display. 
 
 4. The new fund account information and Revenue Source Codes will be added to 
 Standard Voucher (SV) Document for the Summary Receivable Balance and the 
 Write-off (WR) Document.  Existing transaction types will remain in effect for 
 the new fund. 
  
 5.  The Cash Receipt (CR) Document is used for check payments made directly to 
 facilities and applied directly to e-pharmacy receivables. E-pharmacy
 reimbursements received electronically through the EDI Lockbox process will
 immediately be set aside in FMS (fund account 528704/RSC 8NZZ) and then
 transferred via the Transfer (TR) Document to the appropriate fund and
 revenue source code when the dollars received are matched with the
 e-pharmacy receivable. The new fund account information and Revenue Source
 Codes will be added to the TR Document. 
 
 6.  The Bad Debt Report [PRCA NR BAD DEBT ACCR. REPORT], located under the
 Supervisor's Menu [PRCAF SUPERVISOR MENU], is used to print the Bad Debt
 Allowance Estimates that AR stores for one month. The report has been
 modified to display the new fund for Third Party Pharmacy. Existing
 Standard General Ledger (SGL) account numbers will remain in effect for the
 new fund.
