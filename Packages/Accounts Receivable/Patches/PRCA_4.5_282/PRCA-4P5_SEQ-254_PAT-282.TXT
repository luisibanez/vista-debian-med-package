Subject: BAD DEBT REPORT CORRECTION

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VA Central Office (VACO) reported an issue found in the Accounts 
 Receivable Bad Debt Report [PRCA NR BAD DEBT ACCR. REPORT]. This defect 
 causes "No Fault Auto" receivables to be incorrectly accounted for on the 
 Bad Debt Report. Only members in the facility's local RC AR DATA COLLECTOR
 mail group will receive this report.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000526331 Located a defect in routine RCRJRBD
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A). VA Central Office (VACO) reported an issue found in the Accounts 
 Receivable Bad Debt Report. This defect causes "No Fault Auto" 
 receivables to be incorrectly accounted for on the Bad Debt Report.
  
 B). In routine RCRJRBD, a LOCK is not compliant with the Programming
 Standards and Conventions (SAC) standards. Based on the SAC, the LOCK
 command must have a timeout. However, the LOCK command in routine
 RCRJRBD is missing the timeout.
  
 2.4.6 LOCK Command 
  
 2.4.6.1 All LOCKs shall be of the incremental form. (Exemption: Kernel) 
  
 All incremental LOCKS must have a timeout, the timeout must not be less 
 than the value of the Kernel variable "DILOCKTM". 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A). Modified routine RCRJRBD to correct order of expression evaluation; 
 the use of parentheses can alter the strict left to right order of 
 expression evaluation. To get the correct Standard General Ledger  
 (SGL) and Fund, both expressions have to be true. For example, the
 Fund is 528711 AND the category has to be either Workman's Comp (6) OR 
 No-Fault Auto (7). If both expressions are true, the SGL is 1319.5.
  
 The line of the code is changed
 from "I $G(FUND)=528711&(CAT=6)!(CAT=7) Q 1319.5"
 to   "I $G(FUND)=528711&((CAT=6)!(CAT=7)) Q 1319.5"
  
 So, the "No-Fault Auto" receivables will have the correct SGL for the 
 Fund other than 528711. Otherwise, it will be causing the allowance in 
 528711 to be overstated.
  
 B). The timeout has been added to the LOCK command in routine RCRJRBD; 
 therefore, the LOCK is now SAC compliant.
