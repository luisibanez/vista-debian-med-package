Subject: FIX RCIB VARS & TRANS NUM

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will fix two issues found with the transmission of the original
 bill to the Regional Counsel (RC).
  
   1. Accounts Receivable does not include Prosthetics data with the claim.
   2. Accounts Receivable does not include Revenue Code charges with the 
      claim.
  
 This patch will also fix a display format problem between the transaction 
 number and the comment field under the TRANSACTIONS section of the 
 Profile of Accounts Receivable [PRCAC PROFILE] option since there is no 
 space between these fields. The changes will let the display easier to 
 read by the viewer.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000064275 - ISA-1004-10314 REGIONAL COUNSEL INTERFACE PROBLEM
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Revenue Codes charges and Prosthetics data information were missing
    when selecting the action Refer Bill(s) to RC in the Review/Refer TP
    Bills to RC [PRCAC RC REVIEW/REFER] option to transmit bills to
    Regional Counsel.
  
    Array RCIB("PDR") and RCIB("RCV") were misspelled in the routine.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine RCRCXM1 to correct references the RCIB("PRD") array 
    and RCIB("RVC") array.
  
 2. HD0000000296847 - Transaction Number so large running into comments
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running the option Profile of Accounts Receivable [PRCAC 
    PROFILE], under the TRANSACTIONS section, there is no space between the
    transaction number and comment field if the transaction is a COMMENT
    or an ADJUSTMENT type or a receipt; users are difficult to distinguish
    the content between these fields.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routine PRCADR2 to add two spaces between the transaction 
    number and comment field and add spaces among the rest of fields to
    make them easier to read.
