Description:
============

 **************************************************************************
 Note: the Compliance Date is July 30, 2012.
  
 This is a high priority patch to prevent reconciliation issues and loss 
 in revenue from deposits. The VA must comply with the Treasury mandate and
 be able to accept the new deposit number schema from the Treasury 
 contracted bank. 
 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch will resolve the following three issues:
  
 1. For manual creation of deposits, VistA Accounts Receivable (AR)
    must be changed to allow users to create a deposit record with a
    Deposit Ticket Number that is six digits long, with no restrictions on
    the first three digits.  
  
 2. For the Third Party EDI Lockbox process, AR must be changed to accept
    any nine-digit deposit number.
  
 3. The following four AR reports are being adjusted to display all of the 
    nine-digit deposit number field (not just six of the digits).
  
    EFT Deposit Reconciliation Report [RCDPE DEPOSIT RECON REPORT]
    Daily Activity Report [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
    EFT Unmatched Aging Report [RCDPE EFT AGING REPORT]
    Unapplied EFT Deposits Report [RCDPE UNAPPLIED EFT DEP REPORT]

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000536657 Emergency changes to AR to accommodate OTCnet/Treasury
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Recently, a problem was encountered with OTCnet deposits rejecting in 
 the Accounts Receivable (AR) system. The deposits had to be canceled 
 and re-deposited by using other processing methods. 
  
 The CBO has requested the following changes for the Deposit Ticket
 Number in the AR system:
  
    1. For manual creation of deposits, AR must be changed to allow users
       to create a deposit record with a Deposit Ticket Number that is six
       digits long, with no restrictions on the first three digits.
  
    2. For the Third Party EDI Lockbox process, AR must be changed to
       accept any nine-digit deposit number.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
    1. The limitation on the TICKET # (#.01) field definition of the AR
       DEPOSIT (#344.1) file that prevents users from entering Deposit
       Ticket Number beginning with the numbers 269, 369, 469, 569, or 669
       is being removed.
  
       In addition, the TICKET # (#.01) field PRE-LOOKUP 
       (D LOOKUP^RCDPUDEP) will be updated to allow users to use 269, 369, 
       469, 569, or 669 prefix for Deposit Ticket Number when using the
       RCDP Deposit Processing option. Manual entering will continue to be
       limited to six digits.
    
    2. Routines RCDPEM and RCDPESR3 are modified to remove the restrictions
       for accepting only series numbers starting with '469' and '569' for
       the Third Party EDI Lockbox process. It now accepts any sequence.
       A Deposit Ticket Number of nine digits is still limited to the
       Lockbox automated deposit process.
  
       The restrictions for only accepting the '469' and '569' series 
       numbers is being removed in the AR DEPOSIT RECORD (#.03) field
       definition of the EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT (#344.3) file.
  
 2. HD0000000623959 - Repair 5 reports affected by PRCA*4.5*283
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The following four reports (not five as previously thought) require
 modification to display the full 9-digit deposit number.
  
    EFT Deposit Reconciliation Report [RCDPE DEPOSIT RECON REPORT]
    Daily Activity Report [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX ACT REPORT]
    EFT Unmatched Aging Report [RCDPE EFT AGING REPORT]
    Unapplied EFT Deposits Report [RCDPE UNAPPLIED EFT DEP REPORT]
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine RCDPEREC, RCDPEDAR, RCDPEDA1, RCDPEAR2, and RCDPE8NZ to
 display the full 9-digit deposit number.
  
  
 Components Sent with Patch:
 ===========================
 The following is a list of updated fields included in this patch:
  
         Field Name (Number)             File Name (Number)
         ------------------------        ----------------------------
         TICKET # (#.01)                 AR DEPOSIT (#344.1)
         AR DEPOSIT RECORD (#.03)        EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT (#344.3)
  
 Technical:
 ==========
 A pre-installation routine (RCDPP283) is included. The purpose of it is 
 to delete the AR DEPOSIT RECORD (#.03) field in the EDI LOCKBOX DEPOSIT
 (#344.3) file so that the field definition for the field can be replaced
 with the partial DD included in the patch. No data is deleted, only the 
 field definition will be deleted.

      ANONYMOUS SOFTWARE DIRECTORY from a specific server as follows:

      Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City  ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The documentation distribution includes:
