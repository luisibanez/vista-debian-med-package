Subject: EPAY II - CORRECTIONS TO PRCA276 DESCRIPTION

Category: 
  - Informational
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 The patch description for PRCA*4.5*276 has incorrect statements, which
 this informational patch identifies and restates accurately.
  
  
 EFT Worklist -
 The Remove Duplicate EFT Deposits option was added to the EDI Lockbox Menu
 which provides the capability to remove a duplicate EFT from the EFT
 Unmatched Aging report [RCDPE EFT AGING REPORT]. Patch PRCA*4.5*276 
 incorrectly identifies that the user must have the security key 
 [RCDPE RETURNED TO PAYER]. The security key that should have been 
 identified (and to be assigned to the proper users) is Remove Duplicate 
 EFTs [RCDPE REMOVE DUPLICATES].
  
  
 EEOB Worklist Search -
 While a search for ERA records is in progress, the Vista system displays
 information to the user that indicates that the system is continuing to
 gather records to prepare for the display of the EEOB Worklist. Patch
 PRCA*4.5*276 incorrectly states that the "." character is displayed while
 this search is in progress. Rather than the "." character, dialogue is
 displayed (e.g.,"SEARCHING, PLEASE STANDBY").
  
  
 RCDPE MOVE COPY mail group -
 This is a new mail group delivered with PRCA*4.5*276. Bulletins are sent
 to this mail group which identify inactive EEOBs that have been moved or
 copied within the last 24 hours. PRCA*4.5*276 does not provide the member
 set-up instruction for this new mail group. The following instruction and
 example can be used:
  
 Assign the proper ePayments users to the members field of the RCDPE MOVE
 COPY mail group. The list of members can be obtained from the ePayments
 supervisory staff.
