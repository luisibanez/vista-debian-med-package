Subject: INFORMATIONAL - VistA Standardization: Functional Independence

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch is issued as directed in Memorandum: Open Source 
 VistA Deployment (VAIQ #7256522), dated Aug 31, 2012. Refer to this 
 document for specific details.
   
 A review of the VistA Standardization routines was completed for: 
 Functional Independence, version 1.0. A baseline list of the nationally 
 released M routines and their official checksums is included below. VistA 
 Standardization Certification represents the matching of the routine 
 checksums, compared in the site's Production account only.
   
 The VistA Standardization Team performed an analysis of each site's 
 Production environment. For any site with routine checksum variance, this 
 team worked with the site to remediate any variance from the baseline. 
 After the completion of this process, sites with no variance were 
 identified as VistA Standardization Certified for the package. There is 
 NO additional action required on the part of these sites. 
   
 For sites which had variance (local modification) and determined it was 
 important to maintain for their Production environment, a waiver was 
 requested. If approved, the waiver allows retention of the local 
 modification to a VistA Standardization routine, as detailed in VA 
 Directive 6402.
   
 Each site will be placed on one of the lists below:  
       VistA Standardization Certified Sites
       Sites with Approved/Pending Waiver
       Non-Compliant Sites with Pending Remediation
  
 The expectation for sites on the Non-Compliant Sites with Pending 
 Remediation list is for their remediation to be completed, by either 
 removing the modification or requesting a waiver. There will NOT be an 
 additional Informational Only patch to move the site to the VistA 
 Standardization Certified Sites list.
   
 Please Note:
       Environment check routines, pre or post installation routines 
 remaining from previously installed patches, compiled routines (e.g. 
 cross-reference), or prior package version routines, will NOT affect your 
 site's standardization compliance. Their existence, or non-existence, at 
 your site, or on the VistA Standardization routines list below, does not 
 impact the VistA Standardization Certification. 
           
       VistA Standardization Certification for this package applies to the 
 date specified in the Official Checksum heading below. If additional 
 patches, or a newer version for the package, has been released since this 
 date, the checksums for affected routines will be different. For these 
 routines, refer to the patch/version documentation for the most 
 up-to-date checksums.
