Category:

  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the following issues:
  
 1)  Allow the OWCP (Office of Workers' Compensation Programs)
     CHARGEBACK SUFFIX field (#.8) field to accept numeric values
 2)  Issues with classifying Incident Outcome
 3)  Death is not checked on OSHA300 Report
 4)  Fix misleading description on the "Reason for Controvert 
     Report" and the "Reason for Dispute Report"
  
 Associated Remedy ticket(s):
 ----------------------------
 1)  HD0000000194501    Changing ASISTS OWCP CHARGEBACK CODES
 2)  HD0000000396917    ASISTS - Cannot save Classify Incident Outcome
 3)  HD0000000461742    Death is not checked on OSHA Report
 4)  HD0000000472221    ASISTS Reports Discrepancies

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1)  HD0000000194501    Changing ASISTS OWCP CHARGEBACK CODES
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 Currently, the OWCP CHARGEBACK SUFFIX field (#.8) from the STATION
 subfile (#2262.03) in the ASISTS (Automated Safety Incident 
 Surveillance and Tracking System) SITE PARAMETER (#2262) file only
 allows values of two alpha characters and for certain stations, 
 numerics are necessary. 
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the Data Dictionary for the OWCP CHARGEBACK SUFFIX field (#.8)
 to allow numeric characters.  Also, need to modify code in the 
 Graphical User Interface (GUI) that restricts this field to only Alpha
 Characters. 
   
 2)  HD0000000396917    ASISTS - Cannot save Classify Incident Outcome
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When ASISTS updates the INCIDENT OUTCOME (#2260.095) subfile in the 
 ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING (#2260) file it passes the actual names for
 the INCIDENT CREATED BY (#7) and LAST EDITED BY (#9) fields rather 
 than the DUZs (internal values).  So when there are multiple names, 
 Fileman does not know who to resolve the name to for those fields and 
 the update fails. 
    
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Where it can, the GUI now passes the internal value of the user.  Also,
 prior to filing, OOPSGUIC will check if the values representing the 
 users are in internal or external format.  If they are in external
 format then it will set the values to the internal values to
 uniquely identify the users.
  
 3)  HD0000000461742    Death is not checked on OSHA Report
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When an incident has an "Incident Outcome" of death on the OSHA 
 (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) report, the incident is
 counted on the OSHA300 log, but the box indicating there was a death
 is not checked. 
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the code in the GUI to make sure if an incident has an "Incident
 Outcome" of death that the box is checked.
  
  
 4)  HD0000000472221    ASISTS Reports Discrepancies
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 On the ASISTS "Reason for Controvert Report" and the "Reason for Dispute
 Report" the description of the count representing the amount of 
 cases with additional free text detail is misleading.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Based on the current description, users would expect the count to 
 reflect the number of cases with ANY data in Block 36, when the 
 actual count reflects cases with "State the reason in detail" data.
 The description will be changed from:
  
 Number of Cases (from above) with data in Block 36:
  
 To:
  
 Number of Cases (from above) with additional "State 
 the reason in detail" data in Block 36:

 The KIDS build will be distributed in the normal fashion. All VA Medical
 Centers are encouraged to use the TCPIP FTP functionality to obtain the
 install guide, GUI portion, and updated user manual of the software from
 one of the following OI Field Offices:
  
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directories:
  
         OI Field Office        FTP Address             
         ----------------       -----------              
         Albany                 ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  
         Hines                  ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov  
         Salt Lake City         ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
         VistA Download Site    download.vista.med.va.gov
  
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may 
 also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
  Salt Lake City ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov     <ftp://ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov> 
  
 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: It has been determined that the install will not work with sites 
 using SCCM as a method of distribution.  This is not a defect of ASISTS 
 or the install file, but rather SCCM's inability to work with the install
 file because it requires user interaction.  Due to certain customizable 
 options available during the interactive install and following the 
 initial ASISTS Installation user manual, it has been determined future 
 distributions will go out as previous versions have as an INTERACTIVE 
 INSTALL so this install WILL NOT work at sites using SCCM.
