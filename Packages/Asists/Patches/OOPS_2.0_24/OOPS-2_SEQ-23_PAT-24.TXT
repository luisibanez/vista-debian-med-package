 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 HD0000000620373    User cannot classify Incident Outcome
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 When ASISTS updates the INCIDENT OUTCOME (#2260.095) subfile in the ASISTS
 ACCIDENT REPORTING (#2260) file it uses a FILEMAN Application Package
 Interface (API) to complete the update that will look for partial matches
 on the data. In cases where the user has a four digit DUZ it does not know
 if the value is a DUZ or the last four digits of the social security
 number so it quits without completing the file update.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the filing code to update the INCIDENT CREATED BY (#7) and LAST 
 EDITED BY (#9) fields in the INCIDENT OUTCOME (#95) sub-file and update 
 the entries as internal values.
