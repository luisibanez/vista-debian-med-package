Description:
============

 This patch addresses 3 issues in the ASISTS (Automated Safety
 Incident Surveillance and Tracking System) GUI (Graphical User Interface):
  
 1) Issues displaying Stations on the "Edit Site Parameter" form 
 2) Incident Outcome display order problems
 3) OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) 300 "Away From 
    Work" and "Job Transfer/Restriction" calculation issues

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) INC000000781436  Site Perimeters are not showing up
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 If a site has an inactive station in the ASISTS SITE PARAMETER file
 (#2262) any station following the inactive station will fail
 to display on the "Edit Site Parameter" form in the ASISTS GUI.   
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the code so that when a Station entry is encountered that is 
 marked as inactive, the process will continue to list all stations listed
 in the file after the inactive one.
  
 Routine: OOPSGUI6
  
 2) INC000000730564  ASISTS - Other:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 Once an individual exceeds nine records in the INCIDENT OUTCOME 
 SUB-FILE (#95) in the ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING (#2260) file, the records 
 begin to display out of chronological order on the Incident Outcome form
 on the ASISTS GUI.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The FILEMAN call to retrieve the records and subsequently return the results
 to the ASISTS GUI does not sort correctly once the subfile reaches ten
 records.  This patch will add code to further sort the results to ensure
 the data returned to the ASISTS GUI will be in the order the records were
 saved in the INCIDENT OUTCOME SUB-FILE (#95). 
  
 Routine: OOPSGUIC
  
 3) INC000000809171  ASISTS - Report Issue:
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 The system will calculate the total days the individual has accumulated 
 for all added incident outcome classification entries.  The result will 
 be the summation of the actual number of days for both "Away From Work" 
 and "Job Transfer/Restriction" entries.  If the calculated total days for 
 a specific case exceed 180 days, the maximum number of days that will 
 be reported for that case on the OSHA 300 Log will be 180 days.  However,
 if the summation equals exactly 180 days, it fails to record the most
 recent incident outcome days.    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the software to account for instances when the summation equals
 exactly 180 days so that all valid incident outcome data is included.
