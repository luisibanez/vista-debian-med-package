 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1) HD0000000417677  UNDEF ERROR
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 If an ASISTS user views an ASISTS ACCIDENT REPORTING file (#2260) 
 record with the following parameters:
 PERSONNEL STATUS field (#2) = Employee;
 SSN field (#5) = empty or null;
 HIRE DATE field (#336) = empty or null; 
 using ASISTS option "Complete/Validate/Sign Incident report", an 
 <UNDEFINED> error occurs in Vista which causes the ASISTS application to
 fail. 
  
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 When trying to retrieve a hire date for the employee, the software
 assumes a social security number (SSN) exists and instances where it 
 does not an undefined error occurs. Routine OOPSGUI7 has been modified to
 handle instances where the SSN does not exist.
  
  
 2) HD0000000171144  Need Ft. Sill National Cemetery (4459) listed in
                     the OWCP charge back codes.
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 A Fort Sill National Cemetery OWCP Chargeback code is required by DOL
 (Department of Labor) for the submission of a CA1/CA2 claim.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine OOPS2P22 has been modified to update the ASISTS OWCP CHARGEBACK
 CODES file (#2263.6) with an entry for Fort Sill National Cemetery (see
 File Updates section below).
  
  
 3) HD0000000392958  Chargeback Codes need to be added to file
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 OWCP Chargeback codes are needed for three entries as required 
 by DOL for the submission of a CA1/CA2 claims (see File Updates below).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routine OOPS2P22 has been modified to update the ASISTS OWCP CHARGEBACK
 CODES file (#2263.6) with the necessary codes.
