 *****************  MANDATORY PRE-INSTALLATION ACTIVITY  *****************
 The IB/MCCF Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to 
 the Installation of this patch.
 See Pre/Post Installation Overview in this patch description for details.
 *************************************************************************
  
 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch introduces substantial changes to the
 electronic transmission of claims and to the local printing of claim 
 forms (CMS-1500 and UB-04).
  
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
 1. Add new fields to the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT
    BILLING INFO] to allow users to enter new X12 5010 data elements to
    claims for health care services provided to patients.
  
 2. Remove fields that are no longer needed in an X12 5010 claims 
    transmission from the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT 
    BILLING INFO].
  
 3. Modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    837 Health Care Claim message formats to reflect the changes made to
    Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO].
  
 4. Modify the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
    to retrieve the calculated Billing Provider's name from the new BILLING
    FACILITY NAME field (#200) of the INSTITUTION file (#4).
  
 5. Modify the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
    to allow the creation of electronic claims to a payer which are
    subsequent to Medicare WNR, without first sending the claims to
    Medicare for receipt of Medicare-Equivalent Remittance Advice (MRA).
  
 6. Modify the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
    to allow users to enter larger dollar amounts for each line item 
    (9999999.99).
  
 7. Modify the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO]
    and the HIPAA 837 Health Care Claim transmissions to no longer require
    or transmit Social Security Numbers (SSNs) as primary IDs for human
    providers.
  
 8. Modify the Auto-biller process so that claims for health care services
    provided to patients are only created for dates of service that fall
    within both the Filing Time Frame (FTF) of the payer and the effective
    dates of the patients' insurance.
  
 9. Modify the Auto-biller process so that institutional claims for health
    care services provided to patients are created with a calculated
    Billing Provider of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) if the
    patient was treated at the VAMC, or the first Community Based
    Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), if the patient was not treated at the VAMC,
    but was treated at more than one CBOC on the date of service.
  
 10. Modify the Provider ID Maintenance option [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] to
     allow users to define Contact Information for non-VA Facilities.
  
 11. Modify the Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO 
     EDIT] to allow users to set a flag that will determine when
     automatically created secondary/tertiary claims must be forced to
     print locally (set to allow transmission at the time of installation).
  
 12. Modify the Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO 
     EDIT] to allow users to set a flag that will determine when claims 
     secondary to Medicare WNR claims, which were not first sent to
     Medicare (no MRAs), must be forced to print locally (set to not allow
     transmission at the time of installation).
  
 13. Modify the Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO 
     EDIT] to allow users to select additional Electronic Plan Type
     Qualifiers.
  
 14. Add the ability for the system to automatically create and transmit
     secondary/tertiary claims (non-Medicare) to payers when the
     Explanation of Benefits (EOB) data from the primary/secondary claims
     meets specified criteria.
  
 15. Add the ability for users to access a new option, COB Management 
     Worklist [IBCE COB MANAGEMENT], to manage those secondary/tertiary
     claims whose EOB data fails to meet specified criteria.
  
 16. Add a new, non-human user called AUTHORIZER,IB REG  to the New 
     Person (#200) file, to the system to which the automatic
     processing of secondary/tertiary claims will be attributed.
  
 17. Add new, and remove old warning/error messages, to support the changes
     to the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING INFO].
  
 18. Remove the default Billing Provider Secondary ID (the Tax ID Number of
     the VAMC) that used to be added to claims if no Billing Provider
     Secondary ID was defined in Insurance Company Entry/Edit [IBCN
     INSURANCE CO EDIT].
  
 19. Modify the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING 
     INFO] to prevent the addition of the hard-coded Medicare Billing
     Provider Secondary IDs (674499 and 670899) from being erroneously
     added to Medicare WNR Part A claims when they are not defined in the
     Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT].
  
 20. Modify the MCCR Site Parameters Display/Edit option [IBJ MCCR SITE
     PARAMETERS] to allow users to define printers to which automatically 
     created secondary/tertiary claims, and their associated EOBs, can be
     sent when the payer is unable to accept electronic claims, and to
     disable the automatic processing of secondary/tertiary claims.
  
 21. Addresses an issue with claims rejection due to the Taxonomy code
     for the rendering provider having no value.

 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 eClaims Iteration 4 #20080109
  
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 1. HD00000000259725 Billing Problem after user has been terminated in new
                     person file
  
 2. HD0000000361576  Billing Provider ID Invalid for Payor - 674499
   
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 1. HD00000000259725 Billing Problem after user has been terminated in new
    person file
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a provider was inactivated in the option Deactivate a User
 [XUSERDEACT], and his Taxonomy code was no longer valid, Integrated 
 Billing (IB) didn't populate the code into the claim in the option
 Enter/Edit Billing Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine IBCEF73A, and the trigger data definition in the
 Performed By field of the Provider sub-file under the BILL/CLAIMS (#399)
 file. It will set the Taxonomy code in the file if the event date on the

 The post-init routine will detmine if a Taxonomy code needs to be 
 added to any claim with the status of Entered/Not Review billing when the
 Taxonomy for the provider was not set in the BILL/CLAIMS (#399) file. If
 any are found, they will be listed as part of the install. In addition,
 all Billing Screen Input templates are re-compiled in the post-install for
 the taxonomy trigger data definition and the other DD changes introduced
 with patch *432 (See component list earlier in this description).
  
  
 2. HD0000000361576  Billing Provider ID Invalid for Payor - 674499
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Claims have been rejected due to provider number 674499. This number 
 was provided to the VA a long time ago as a Medicare Psych facility 
 provider number. The number, 674499, is hard-coded in VistA, which causes
 it to override the site's wage index number on inpatient psych claims.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB EDIT BILLING 
 INFO] to prevent the addition of the hard-coded Medicare Billing Provider 
 Secondary IDs (674499 and 670899) from being erroneously added to Medicare
 WNR Part A claims when they are not defined in the Insurance 
 Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO EDIT].

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 ****Important Note: There is one **MANDATORY** pre-installation
     activity associated with this install.
  
 The IB Staff MUST empty the 837 extract/transmission queue PRIOR to
 the installation of this patch. ***
  
 The site IRM would coordinate with the Billing Department to insure that 
 the 837 extract/transmission queue is empty. The Billing Department 
 should be aware of the set of instructions to be executed. If not 
 billing supervisor can be contacted. Once the Billing Department has 
 completed the instruction, the Billing department is to inform IRM that 
 the patch installation could proceed.   
  
 There are no other mandatory pre-installation activities associated
 with this package.
  
  
 **** Please note, if you select the option below, Compare Transport Global
      to Current System, and select #1 Full Comparison, you will get a
      system error:  <UNDEFINED>S+1^DIQ ^IBA(364.6,1937,0) due to a known
      issue with the KIDS Full Compare option (see Remedy Ticket
      HD0000000449218). You can run any of the other 3 compare options
      without issue.
  
 Post installation, the site should define the default printers in Section
 7 of the IB Site Parameters that will provide the ability to print
 automatically created non-Medicare secondary/tertiary claims and their
 associated EOBs for payers who are unable to accept secondary/tertiary
 claims electronically. Failure to define the default printers will 
 prevent IB from automatically printing the claims.
