Subject: ADD CAMP LEJEUNE TREATMENT AS A NON-BILLABLE REASON

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Add CAMP LEJEUNE TREATMENT as a new entry in the CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE
 REASONS file (#356.8).
  
 ================================================================================
  
 Congress has authorized VA (Veterans Administration) to provide hospital
 care and medical services to certain Veterans who served in special
 service conditions per 38 U.S.C. ' 1710(e). A newly added category of
 Veterans are those who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina for
 not fewer than 30 days between the period of January 1, 1957 and December
 31, 1987. This special authority is limited by statute to treatment for 15
 specific conditions or illnesses listed in 1710(e)(1)(F) for all eligible
 Camp Lejeune Veterans and their Family Members.
  
 From years 1957 through 1987, people living or working at the U.S. Marine
 Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, were potentially exposed to drinking
 water contaminated with industrial solvents, benzene, and other chemicals. 
 President Obama signed into law the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for
 Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012, on August 6, 2012. This law (H.R. 1627, 
 now Public Law 112-154) requires VA to provide health care to Veterans who 
 served on active duty at Camp Lejeune (North Carolina) and to eligible Family
 Members for one or more of 15 specified illnesses or conditions:
  
  Esophageal cancer; Lung cancer; Breast cancer; Bladder cancer; Kidney cancer;
  Leukemia; Multiple myeloma; Myelodysplastic syndromes; Renal toxicity; 
  Hepatic steatosis; Female infertility; Miscarriage; Scleroderma; 
  Neurobehavioral effects; and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 
  
 NOTE:  At this time, treatment cannot be provided to Family Members until
 ~~~~~  Congress has appropriated funds for family care and regulations 
        are published.
  
 This patch adds a new Reason Not Billable (RNB) to the CLAIMS TRACKING 
 NON-BILLABLE REASONS (# 356.8) file. Revenue personnel shall use this new RNB
 to document why a potential claim isn't billable for an eligible Camp Lejeune
 Veteran who has been treated for one or more of the 15 specified illnesses
 or conditions.
