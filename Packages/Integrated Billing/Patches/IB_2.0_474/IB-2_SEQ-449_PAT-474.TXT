Subject: FILTER FOR NON BILLABLE PROSTHETICS 

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains two issues. The first involves non billable HCPCS
 (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System) codes for prosthetic items
 that need to be filtered out of the Claims Tracking module. The second
 issue concerns the '^' key which, when entered, does not exit out of the 
 Rate Schedule Adjustment Enter/Edit [IBCR ADJUSTMENT ENTER/EDIT] option as
 expected.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKETS:
 ==========================
 1. HD0000000599144 New Filter for Integrated Billing
 2. HD0000000311105 ^ not exiting as expected

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000599144 New Filter for Integrated Billing
  
  Problem
  -------
  The Chief Business Office (CBO) has requested a patch to filter
  prosthetics out of the Claims Tracking module when their HCPCS codes have
  2 alpha characters at the beginning: DI, DL, EC, EV, FE, HN, HS, NR, RE,
  SB, SI, TH, TR, and VA. They are not billable codes and should not go to
  the Claims Tracking module.
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  A filter was created in routine IBTRKR5 to stop adding prosthetics to the
  Claims Tracking if the associated HCPCS codes start with 2 alpha
  characters used by the CBO as listed above.
  
  
 2. HD0000000311105 ^ not exiting as expected
  
  Problem
  -------
  When site user did not do an adjustment for the rate schedule and entered
  '^' at the 'Is it correct' question prompt, the system did not exit out
  of option Rate Schedule Adjustment Enter/Edit [IBCR ADJUSTMENT 
  ENTER/EDIT].
  
  Resolution
  ----------
  Modified routine IBCREE to display a note 'using '^' to exit the option
  will not change the adjustment' before the 'Is this correct' question
  is prompted. The help message for the question prompt was updated as
  well to accommodate the change.
