Description:
============

 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch finalizes the HIPAA 5010 enhancements.
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
 1. When a procedure is entered on the claim, users are prompted to 
    point/link diagnoses to that procedure. Up to four diagnoses can be 
    linked. If an associated diagnosis code is deleted in the number one 
    slot, the system doesn't re-order the codes, but it moves the
    remaining codes up levels to fill the gaps. So if there are 4 codes
    and 1 and 2 are deleted, the new software will move codes 3 and 4 into
    the 1 and 2 position.
  
 2. Capture and transmit Remaining liability qualifier and Remaining
    Liability to Financial Services Center (FSC). 
  
 3. Only send Purchase Service Provider ID and Purchase Service Amount when
    claims contain a purchased service. The user will now get an error
    instead of a warning for the following conditions:
      a. A Purchase Service Amount exists but the Non-VA Facility is 
         missing. 
      b. A Non-VA Facility exists but there is no Purchase Service Amount.
  
 4. Sync up Purchase Service Provider ID to agree with either Purchase
    Service Provider Primary ID or Purchase Service provider secondary
    ID.  
  
 5. Send 000 in field 4 (Service Line Paid Amt) of the LCOB record and
    field 8 (Other Payer Paid Amt) of OI1 record for entries with 0.00
    dollar amounts.  
    
    Note:  For future payers, the amount will be null instead of 0.00 
           dollars. For example, a secondary claim will show a null entry
           for the tertiary payer and a dollar amount for the secondary
           payer. 
  
 6. Update CHAMPVA Rx Rate Schedules by adding data to the BILLABLE 
    SERVICE and DISPENSING FEE fields.
  
 7. Update TRICARE Rx Rate Schedules by creating two new Rate Schedules 
    for the updated TRICARE dispensing fee of $10.27 with an effective 
    date of 01/23/12. Inactivate the old TRICARE Rx Rate Schedules with an 
    inactive date of 01/22/12.
  
 8. Modify ePharmacy IB Billing Determination by excluding non-pharmacy 
    insurance policies when calculating the Rate Type.
  
 9. Correct slow down in locating 3rd Party claims with EEOBs - The need
    was identified in Remedy ticket HD0000000597554.

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD0000000597554 - Recent changes substantially slowed down the display.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Slow down locating 3rd Party claims with EEOBs - It was determined that
 patches IB*2.0*451 and PRCA*4.5*276 added the ability to identify, via a
 '%' indicator, first party bills associated with third party bills which
 have EEOBs on file. The code to locate the bills utilized the
 cross-reference "D" of the EVENT DATE field (#.03) in the Bill/Claims file
 (#399). It was found that these changes substantially slowed down the
 display of two specific reports to unsatisfactory levels.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 After installation of this patch, the two report options affected will
 utilize the cross-reference "APDT" of the EVENT DATE field (#.03) in the
 Bill/Claims file (#399) to speed up data display. The following options
 are modified:
  
   First Party Follow-Up Report   [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY]
   List all Bills for a Patient   [IB LIST ALL BILLS FOR PAT]
  
  
  
 Test Sites:
 -----------
 Birmingham
 Loma Linda
 North FL/South GA
 Palo Alto
 Richmond
