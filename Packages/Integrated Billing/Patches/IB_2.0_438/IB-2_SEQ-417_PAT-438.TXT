Description:
============

 This patch contains electronic insurance verification (eIV) enhancements,
 which allows VistA to fully comply with Health Insurance Portability and
 Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines by allowing the generation of
 service type specific transactions. It will also further enhance the eIV
 process by modifying existing reports and providing new notification for
 tracking payer links. This patch also includes real-time insurance
 verification functionality and changes to eIV inquiries and responses
 designed to accommodate for transmission of extra information and improved
 error handling.
  
  
 Complete list of patch items:
  
 1. Eligibility inquiry and response messages are now compliant with
    HIPAA 5010 X12 electronic transaction standards.
  
 2. Inquiries may now be sent for multiple service codes, specified by
    user. Responses also include multiple service codes. The selection
    of service codes is now available in the following options:
  
    MCCR Site Parameter Display/Edit  [IBJ MCCR SITE PARAMETERS]
    Request Electronic Insurance Inquiry  [IBCNE REQUEST INQUIRY]
  
 3. More detailed error information and information about insurance
    related dates are now available in the eIV Response Report 
    [IBCNE IIV RESPONSE REPORT] option.
  
 4. Address information now includes country code and country
    sub-division code for all addresses received in the
    eligibility/benefit response message.
  
 5. Additional qualifiers for various pieces of data have been added.
  
 6. Automatic periodic check for unlinked/locally inactive payers has
    been added that sends reminders via Mailman messages to make
    necessary changes to payer maintenance.
  
 7. Real-time insurance verification functionality is now available.
    Verification inquiries will be generated and transmitted right
    after the creation of insurance buffer entry.
