  - Informational

Description:
============

  Per VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST, GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND
  PENSION THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2013, this patch MUST be installed
  before January 1, 2013. The patch is being released as an Emergency patch
  together with DG*5.3*860 (2013 Means Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*108
  (2013 GMT Thresholds) and may be installed out of sequence with respect
  to other released IB patches.
   
  Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
  and for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in 
  the associated billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose 
  of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
  Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2013.
  
  A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
  update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
  section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
  in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST, GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST AND
  PENSION THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2013. If a site has already entered
  the values manually, the record will be overwritten with the national 
  update.
   
  The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2013 (with an effective date 
  of 12/1/12) are defined in VHA FACT SHEET titled MEANS TEST, GEOGRAPHIC-
  BASED MEANS TEST AND PENSION THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2013 as:
   
  *   $ 12,465 for a single veteran without dependents
  *   $ 16,324 for a veteran with 1 dependent
  *   An additional $ 2,129 for each additional dependent beyond 1 
      dependent
   
  And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2013 is shown as:
   
  *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,184.
   
  This patch, IB*2.0*485, is one of three VistA 2013 threshold patches. It 
  addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
  DG*5.3*860 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the 
  Maximum Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*108 will address the annual
  updates for the GMT Thresholds.

  Installation Instructions
  -------------------------
  The components sent with this patch IB*2.0*485 have been included in the 
  HOST File DG_53_P860.KID.  Please follow the instructions listed in the 
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS section of the patch description for patch 
  DG*5.3*860.
    
   
   
  Pre-Installation Instructions
  -----------------------------
  NOTE:  during the installation, please bear in mind items below.
   
     1.   During installation, the BILLING EXEMPTIONS file (#354.1) will be
          checked for medication co-payment exemptions based on prior
          thresholds. If there are some, the installer will be prompted to
          UPDATE AND PRINT the exemptions report since the exemption status
          may change due to the new rates.
    
          Press <Enter> to accept the default value of Update & Print.
          At the DEVICE prompt you must enter a print device. An entry is
          required and the HOME device is not allowed; neither is the
          p-Message device (this will abort the install). You MUST choose a
          valid printer. You need not queue the report since the patch will
          do so automatically.
