 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000742124 The Technical Component (TC) modifier needs to be
     reactivated
  
     Problem:
     --------
     The Chief Business Office has requested to reactivate the Technical 
     Component (TC) Modifier on institutional bills based on the rules:
  
     1. Modifier TC will not be removed from all procedures on institutional 
     bills.
     2. Modifier TC will be added to the procedure on an institutional bill
     if the only professional charge for the procedure is 26 modified. 
  
 
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routine IBCU7A was modified to create a function for adding Modifier TC
     to the procedure on an institutional bill and the 'Modifier TC Added to 
     Procedures (x)' message to accommodate with the change. The line codes
     about Modifier TC removed from all procedures on institutional bills 
     were also commented out in the routine.
 
  
 2) HD0000000768361 Message - Modifier 26 Deleted from Procedures (1)
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When Modifier 58 for the procedure was entered to apply the procedure
    updates for charges on the institutional bill, the 'Modifier 26 Deleted
    from Procedures (1)' message mistakenly appears after that on screen <5>
    in the [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option.
 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Routine IBCU7A was modified to correct the check for Modifier 26 and
    display the Modifier 26 deleted message when the internal number of 
    any Modifier entry is matching up to the internal number of Modifier 26.
