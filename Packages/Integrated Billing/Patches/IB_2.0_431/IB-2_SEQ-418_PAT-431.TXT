Subject: IB - 5010 ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Chief Business Office (CBO) requested enhancements to the Veterans 
 Health Administration (VHA)'s Veterans Health Integrated Systems 
 Technology Architecture (VistA) Third Party Electronic Data Interchange 
 (EDI) Lockbox module ePayments Enhancement project. These enhancements
 will increase timely and accurate processing of payments in compliance 
 with Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and 
 VHA fiscal accounting policies. 
  
 Currently to perform the Accounts Receivable (AR) functions, Veterans 
 Administration Medical Center (VAMC) staff is performing manual 
 workarounds to address limitations of the existing software tools. 
 Addressing ePayments software issues will enable compliance with HIPAA 
 security and administrative regulations as well as VHA Fiscal Accounting 
 policy. 
  
 The project has two patches (PRCA*4.5*269 and IB*2*431) which are being
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi
 build distribution EPAYMENTS_5010.KID.   
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                               PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                 PRCA*4.5*269
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                    IB*2*431
  
  
 Changes made to the INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) application are described
 below. See PRCA*2*269 for changes made to ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE application
 and installation instructions.
  
 IB Package changes
 ------------------
 Modifications are made to allow VistA to receive, process and display 
 ERA/EEOB and MRA EOB data from FSC in HIPAA 5010 compatible format.
  
 Backward compatibility is supported to allow VistA to also receive
 messages in the existing HIPAA 4010 format.
  
 The data content of EEOB messages is modified to meet HIPAA 5010 standard.
  
 Existing EOB Trace #, ICN and Contact Number fields are extended in length
 and new fields are added for:
  
         Claim Received Date
         Coverage Expiration Date
         Corrected Priority Payer Name and ID
         Other Subscriber Name
         Adjustment/Payer Policy Reference
  
 The expanded fields in the 835 messages are also stored in VistA and this
 requires that the database is reorganized. The Crossed Over Name field is
 unchanged but is moved to new locations in the VistA database to make
 space for the extended fields:
  
 This data reorganization is performed as part of the post install routine
 for this patch.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named 
 IBP431. The purpose of the post install routine is to move data 
 in the EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS file (361.1) to new locations within
 the file specified in the released data dictionary changes. This 
 process runs in foreground and will take several minutes to run on
 larger sites.
  
 On completion a bulletin is sent to the installer with the number of
 entries moved.
  
 The post-install routine is not deleted.
