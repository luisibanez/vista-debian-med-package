Subject: CANNOT BILL FOR LOW DRUG COSTS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains two issues. The first issue is about the unit price
 of the drug cost seeming to be zero resulting in an error message of 'Not
 ECME Billable: Cannot find price for Item'. This error message prevents IB
 from generating third party bills for outpatient prescriptions. The second
 issue concerns payment amounts on e-Pharmacy claims where the bill 
 amount is different than what is shown via the ECME Billing Events Report
 [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] option.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000483161 4 Cannot Bill for Low Costs Drug
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Within the VistA Pharmacy Data Management (PSS) package, the Price Per
    Dispense Unit field in the Drug file (#50) and the SYNONYM subfile
    (#50.1) has rounded the dispense unit cost to 0.0000 if its actual
    value from the calculated quotient of the Price Per Order Unit divided
    by the Dispense Units Per Order Unit is less than 0.00005. When this
    unit price of the drug is zero, ePharmacy users encounter an error
    message and cannot generate a 3rd party bill for the prescription
    in the IB package.
    
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines IBNCPDP1 and IBCRCC to verify the unit price of the
    drug when the value received from the PSS package is zero. When the
    value is zero, the actual unit price of the drug is recalculated and 
    then the dispensing fee is added to successfully generate a 3rd party
    bill for the prescription.
  
 2. HD0000000483975 Different Payment Amounts on ePharmacy Claims
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When creating bills for e-Pharmacy claims, if the software is unable to
    determine the CURRENT UNIT PRICE OF DRUG (#1.2) for the corresponding
    REFILL (#52.1) sub-file entry it will default to the UNIT PRICE OF 
    DRUG (#17) for the drug when calculating the bill amount which may 
    lead to an incorrect value. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    When trying to locate the CURRENT UNIT PRICE OF DRUG (#1.2) from the 
    correct REFILL (#52.1) sub-file entry, the software will now use the 
    FILL NUMBER field (#.1) from the IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION REFILL 
    file (#362.4) and pass it to the function call so the billed value is
    calculated using the correct amount.
