Description:
============

 The purpose of this patch is to automate the Extract file transfer 
 created by the HMS data extractor at the VAMCs, sending the data to the 
 HMS Inc. server via the AITC DMI Queue.  
  
 The data sent will be used to identify patients' current, active 
 insurance.  
  
 There is one extract file for each of four different insurance services. 
 Each VAMC may contract individually with HMS Inc. to receive up to four 
 different insurance services: 
  
    HMS_NOINSUR - pulls patient information when there is no insurance on 
 file 
    HMS_ENHNOIN - pulls patient information when the records reflect 
 Medicare 
                  but no other commercial insurance. 
    HMS_NORXINS - pulls patient information when there is no "Prescription 
                  Only" insurance on file.  
  HMS_NONVERINS - pulls patient information for re-verification purposes.  
  
 A site may only run the extracts identified in the current contract and 
 must disable any extract in the event it is not included in a subsequent 
 contract renewal.  The CPAC IV Manager is the COTR for each contract and 
 is expected to communicate any changes in contract status to the IRM's.  
  
 HMS Inc., after processing the extract files, sends the result file back 
 through AITC DMI to the VAMC site so it can be uploaded to the Insurance 
 Buffer file by the HMS Data Extractor. eII software alleviates the 
 administrative burden to the IRM and HMS staff that manually transfer and 
 collect data files from SharePoint,  providing a more efficient and 
 secure insurance identification process.  
  
 HMS/VEHM software must already be installed at the site for the extract 
 process to work.  Pre-installation instructions will describe how to 
 check if the HMS software is on the system. 
 The Electronic Insurance Identification (eII) software automates the 
 existing manual eII process: 
   
 1.      The HMS extracts from VistA will be routed automatically to a 
 central server at AITC as MailMan messages, with no manual 
 intervention from IRM or HMS. Each file is sent as one or more MailMan 
 messages. 
   
 2.      AITC will route the HMS results to the VAMC that initiated the 
 extract, as MailMan messages.
               
 3.      Extract the returning HMS results data from the MailMan messages, 
 and place the file in the designated VMS directory. 
   
 4.      Send the IRM a notification when the results are in the 
 directory. The IRM is able to upload the results to the VistA insurance 
 buffer file. 
   
 5.      HMS data is converted into an XML file format. HMS data has two 
 additional fields: Patient Relationship to Insured ID and Patient ID. 
 These fields are included in the XML file.
   
 6.      The existing HMS extract file will continue to be produced as 
 scheduled.
   
 7.      Automated notification messages will be sent to the IBCNF EII IRM 
 mail Group at the VAMC site if an HMS extract file is not generated by 
 the HMS data extractor software at the site when expected, as defined in 
 the IB SITE PARAMETERS file.
   
 8.      Automated acknowledgement messages are sent from AITC to the 
 VAMCs, acknowledging that the extract file message(s) are received by 
 AITC. If the confirmation message(s) are not received within the expected 
 time (usually 24 hours) as defined in the IB configuration parameter, the 
 IBCNF EII IRM mail group is notified. For each message that no 
 confirmation message is received, a new extract message will be send to 
 AITC. 
   
 9.      The eII Edit Configuration [IBCNF EDIT CONFIGURATION] option is 
 used to enable/disable file transfer and/or set other parameters for eII 
 software.

 Patch Installation: 
   
 Pre/Post Installation Overview 
 ------------------------------
 Before installing this software: 
 1.      Be sure IB*2.0*312 patch is installed at your VAMC.
 2.      Check if the HMS Data Extractor Software is installed at your 
 VAMC by doing a FileMan Inquire into the INSTALL file. If your site has 
 HMS software, there will be an entry for VEHM. 
 3.      Be sure the IB MT NIGHT COMP option is already scheduled to run 
 at your site.
  
 Identify the mail group coordinator (most likely the person who is 
 installing the patch) to be assigned to IBN, IBK,IBX, IBH, IBCNF EII IRM 
 and IBCNF EII XML READY mail groups when installing the patch.  
   
 As part of post-routine's patch installation, the following configuration 
 will be set up. Verify that the fields denoted by "*" match the HMS Data 
 Extractor parameters (if your site is running the HMS Data Extractor 
 software). Extract/Result File names contain station ID (<id>) of the 
 VAMC site where the eII software is installed.  
    
 *HMS DIRECTORY: USER$:[HMS]            *EII ACTIVE: NO 
 *RESULT FILE NAME:VA<id>.TXT           *DAY OF MONTH RESULT FILE DUE: 31 
 *DAYS BEFORE LATE MESSAGE SENT: 2       MAX EXT FILE QUE CONFIRM TIME: 24 
  MAX NUM OF RECORDS PER MESSAGE: 100 
   
  EXTRACT FILE TYPE: NOINSUR           *EXTRACT FILE ACTIVE: YES 
 *FILE NAME: VEHMN<id>.TXT 
  AITC DMI QUEUE EMAIL ADDRESS: XXX@Q-IBN.VA.GOV 
 *DAY OF MONTH EXTRACT FILE DUE:1      *DAYS BEFORE LATE MESSAGE SENT: 2 
   
  EXTRACT FILE TYPE: ENHNOIN           *EXTRACT FILE ACTIVE: YES 
 *FILE NAME:VEHMH<id>.TXT 
  AITC DMI QUEUE EMAIL ADDRESS: XXX@Q-IBH.VA.GOV 
 *DAY OF MONTH EXTRACT FILE DUE:1      *DAYS BEFORE LATE MESSAGE SENT: 2 
   
  EXTRACT FILE TYPE: NORXINS          *EXTRACT FILE ACTIVE: YES 
 *FILE NAME: VEHMX<id>.TXT 
  AITC DMI QUEUE EMAIL ADDRESS: XXX@Q-IBX.VA.GOV 
 *DAY OF MONTH EXTRACT FILE DUE:1      *DAYS BEFORE LATE MESSAGE SENT: 2 
   
  EXTRACT FILE TYPE: NONVERINS        *EXTRACT FILE ACTIVE: YES 
 *FILE NAME: VEHMK<id>.TXT 
  AITC DMI QUEUE EMAIL ADDRESS: XXX@Q-IBK.VA.GOV 
 *DAY OF MONTH EXTRACT FILE DUE:0      *DAYS BEFORE LATE MESSAGE SENT: 2 
   
 Based on the HMS Data Extractor parameters, the above parameters need to 
 be modified.  
   
 Note: For each of the extracts running at the site it is recommended that 
 you set the expected day to 22 (twenty-two) and the days before late 
 message is sent to 0 (zero); the exception to this is the NONVERINS 
 extract, which is run as needed.  
   
 In addition verify that the FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV domain is defined in DOMAIN 
 file. The patch installation will then create the following entries in 
 the DOMAIN file: 
   
 NAME: Q-IBH.VA.GOV                      FLAGS: S 
   RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV       DISABLE TURN COMMAND: YES 
   
 NAME: Q-IBK.VA.GOV                      FLAGS: S 
   RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV       DISABLE TURN COMMAND: YES 
   
 NAME: Q-IBN.VA.GOV                      FLAGS: S 
   RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV       DISABLE TURN COMMAND: YES 
   
 NAME: Q-IBX.VA.GOV                      FLAGS: S 
   RELAY DOMAIN: FOC-AUSTIN.VA.GOV       DISABLE TURN COMMAND: YES 
   
 After the eII software is installed and activated, the communication 
 between the AITC DMI Queue and your VAMC should already be established 
 and AITC should be able to transfer Extract and Result files between VAMC 
 and HMS Inc. server too.

 2.      Run the Core --> IB --> IRM --> eII Edit Configuration to match 
 their values with HMS Data Extractor parameters.  
    
 Depending on how the HMS Data Extractor parameters are set up, you may 
 accept or change the default values. Also, be sure to set the EII ACTIVE 
 field to "YES". In the following list <id> postfix is the station id of 
 the VAMC site where the eII software is installed.  
  
 Note: For each of the extracts running at the site, it is recommended 
 that you set the expected day of month extract file due to 22 
 (twenty-two), and the days before late message is sent to 0 (zero). The 
 exception to this is the NONVERINS extract which is run as needed.
