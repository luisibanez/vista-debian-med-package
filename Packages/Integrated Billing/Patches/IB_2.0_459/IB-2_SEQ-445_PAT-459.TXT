Subject: CORRECTING CLAIMS MATCHING REPORT and IB ACTION TYPE FILE ENTRIES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues. The first change is to fix the Claims
 Matching Report [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH] regarding sometimes missing
 corresponding first party debts for third party claims. The second issue
 is that an incorrect charge type of NURSING HOME (NSC) is showing on 
 some patient's bills.
  
 This patch contains a combined package Kernel Installation and Distribution
 System (KIDS) host file. The following are included in the host file:
  
       IB*2.0*459     Contained in KIDS Host File IB_20_459.KID
       PRCA*4.5*280   Contained in KIDS Host File IB_20_459.KID

 OVERVIEW OF REMEDY TICKETS(s):
 ==============================
 1. HD0000000264756 Claims Matching Report will not pull e-pharmacy CMOP
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site user reported that the Claims Matching Report [RCDP CLAIMS MATCH]
    didn't pull corresponding first party e-pharmacy CMOP claims.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified routines IBEFUR and IBEFURF to use the FILL NUMBER (#.1) field
    in the IB BILL/CLAIMS PRESCRIPTION REFILL (#362.4) file to find the
    associated first party debts for the third party claims when they have
    the matching copays in the system.
  
 2. HD0000000473968 Incorrect charge type
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The sites and patients are seeing NURSING HOME CARE (NSC) instead of
    HOSPITAL CARE (NSC) for when the patient charges are:
       DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) CANCEL   
       DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) NEW       
       DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) UPDATE. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The post-init routine IB20P459 will apply a correction to the IB ACTION
    TYPE (#350.1) file CHARGE CATEGORY (#.03) field to change three
    records. After that an Accounts Receivable routine will correct the
    necessary associated ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (#430) file records in the
    TYPE OF CARE (#15.1) field to correspond.
  
    Shown here are all six of the DG Fee Service records, and the three 
    changes:
  
 From:
  
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) CANCEL    NURSING HOME CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) NEW       NURSING HOME CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) UPDATE    NURSING HOME CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) CANCEL     OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) NEW        OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) UPDATE     OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
  
 To:
  
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) CANCEL    HOSPITAL CARE (NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) NEW       HOSPITAL CARE (NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (INPT) UPDATE    HOSPITAL CARE (NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) CANCEL     OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) NEW        OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
 DG FEE SERVICE (OPT) UPDATE     OUTPATIENT CARE(NSC)
  
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ==========================
 It is recommended that this patch be installed outside of normal business
 hours to avoid any complications resulting from users on the system.
  
 Install Time - less than 30 minutes - but will vary from site to site
 depending on the size of two files: the INTEGRATED BILLING ACTION (#350)
 file which is searched for AR bills, and then the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
 (#430) file.
  
  
  1.  Retrieve the KIDS distribution host file. This patch will be
      distributed in a host file due to the amount of data contained in
      the patch.  The name of the host file is:
  
      IB_20_459.KID
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
           download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
           Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
           Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
           Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The IB_20_459.KID host file is located in the anonymous.software
      directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
  2.  Load the KIDS distribution that is contained in file IB_20_459.KID

      a.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
      b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
          (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
      c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
          you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
          transport global.
  
  5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package IB*2.0*459
