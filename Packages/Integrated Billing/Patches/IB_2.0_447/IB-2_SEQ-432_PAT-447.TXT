Description:
============

 This Integrated Billing (IB) patch expands the HIPAA 5010 enhancements 
 introduced in patch IB*2.0*432.
  
 The intent of this patch is to:
  
  1. Add new fields to the Enter/Edit Billing Information option [IB
     EDIT BILLING INFO] to allow users to enter additional data
     elements to claims for health care services provided to patients.
  
  2. Modify the logic which calculates what the monetary amounts that 
     were bill to the secondary payers on the MRA Statistics Report
     option [IBCEM MRA STATISTICS REPORT].
  
  3. Modify the outbound 837 Heath Care Claims transmissions to 
     incorporate the additional or modified data elements that may be
     added to a claim.
  
  4. Modify the printing process for outpatient, UB04 claims to print 
     the Priority (Type) of Admission.
  
  5. Modify the printing process for UB04 and CMS-1500 claims to allow 
     the printing of Revenue/Procedure codes with zero dollar amounts.
  
  6. Modify the Insurance Company Entry/Edit option [IBCN INSURANCE CO 
     EDIT] to allow users to assign additional MEDIGAP policies as Type
     of Plan for an Insurance Company.
  
  7. Create a new option called the Non-MRA Productivity Report option 
     [IBCEM NON-MRA REPORT].
  
  8. Modify the mnemonic for the Third Party Billing Menu [IB THIRD 
     PARTY BILLING MENU].
  
  9. Modify the Insurance Payment Trend Report option [IB OUTPUT TREND 
     REPORT] to display the Insurance Plan Group Number.
  
  10. Modify the Correct Rejected/Denied Bill option [IB CORRECT 
      REJECTED/DENIED] to allow the correction of claims to
      non-accruing funds such as TRICARE claims.
