Subject: FIX FOR EIV INQUIRIES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch contains the fix for the issue with the eIV interface where it
 is possible for an inquiry to go out without a value in segment IN1, field
 2 when either the patient is a dependent, or patient relationship is left
 blank, and patient id is left blank in the insurance buffer entry.
  
 New logic will add an extra check to PROCESS INSURANCE BUFFER [IBCN 
 INSURANCE BUFFER PROCESS] option, real-time inquiry, and buffer extract
 that will ensure that entries are placed into the transmission queue only
 if either of the following conditions is met:
  
   - If subscriber inquiry (patient relationship is set to "self" or is
     blank) AND subscriber id is not blank
   - If dependent inquiry (patient relationship is not set to "self" and
     is not blank) AND patient id is not blank
  
 If neither condition is met, the buffer entry will not trigger an eIV
 transmission (either via real-time inquiry or via buffer extract) until
 the necessary data is entered into the insurance buffer file. The buffer
 entry in question will display a "!" (unable to transmit) symbol and when 
 expanded will contain a message specifying the reason - either missing
 subscriber id or missing patient id.
  
 The following error message is being added:
  
 eIV could not create an inquiry for this entry. This dependant inquiry 
 requires the Patient ID field to be populated before an inquiry can be 
 transmitted electronically.
  
 Action to take:  Update the inquiry with the missing Patient ID or 
 contact the insurance company to manually verify this insurance 
 information.

 Subscriber ID field to be populated before an inquiry can be transmitted 
 electronically.
  
 Action to take: Update the inquiry with the missing Subscriber ID or
