Subject: 2012 RX COPAY THRESHOLDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Per forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2011-###, new effective rates for Means 
 Test Thresholds, GMT Thresholds, and RX Copay Thresholds will go into 
 effect January 1, 2012. To ensure compliance with the forthcoming VHA 
 Directive, IB*2.0*465 MUST be installed by December 28, 2011. This patch 
 is being released as an Emergency patch together with DG*5.3*848 (2012
 Means Test Thresholds) and EAS*1.0*104 (2012 GMT Thresholds) and may be
 installed out of sequence with respect to other released IB patches.
  
 Please Note:  We expect the VHA Directive to be titled MEANS TEST AND 
 GEOGRAPHIC-BASED MEANS TEST THRESHOLDS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012. In order 
 to provide adequate time for sites to install, Central Business Office 
 has agreed that these patches may be released prior to availability of 
 the actual Directive Number.
   
 Every year, the government sets new values for the Medicare deductible 
 and for the pension threshold rates. These values need to be updated in 
 the associated billing files for accurate and legal billing. The purpose 
 of this patch is to assist sites in the entry of the Basic Pension 
 Threshold rates and the Medicare Deductible value for Calendar Year 2012.
  
 A post-init routine is included in this patch, which will automate the 
 update of the new Medicare and pension threshold values. The Technical 
 section below contains a list of the new rates, which may also be found 
 in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2011-###. If a site has already entered the
 values manually, the record will be overwritten with the national update.
   
 The new pension rates for Calendar Year 2012 (with an effective date 
 of 12/1/11) are defined in forthcoming VHA DIRECTIVE 2011-### as:
   
 *   $ 12,256 for a single veteran without dependents
 *   $ 16,051 for a veteran with 1 dependent
 *   An additional $ 2,093 for each additional dependent beyond 1 dependent
   
 And the Medicare deductible rate effective 01/01/2012 is shown as:
   
 *   The Medicare deductible:  $ 1,156.
   
 This patch, IB*2.0*465, is one of three VistA 2012 threshold patches. It 
 addresses the annual updates for the Pharmacy Copay Thresholds. Patch 
 DG*5.3*848 will update the thresholds for the Means Tests and the Maximum 
 Annual Pension Rate. Patch EAS*1.0*104 will address the annual updates for 
 the GMT Thresholds.
