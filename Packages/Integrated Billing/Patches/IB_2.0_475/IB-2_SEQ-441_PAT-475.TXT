Subject: TCP/IP ADDRESS UPDATE FOR THE HL7 LOGICAL LINK 'IIV EC'

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch contains the update for the TCP/IP address of the HL7 Logical
 Link 'IIV EC' record in the HL Logical Link (#870) file, and this change 
 is being made to connect to the new National Healthcare Insurance Cache
 server that is located at the FSC (Financial Services Center) in Austin,
 Texas.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD000000600402 Testing of VistA Logical Links
  
  Problem:
  --------
  Site POC reported that the FSC facility is in the process of moving their
  current interface connection from their old server to a new refresh server
  and they will need to change the logical link after the procedure has been
  performed. Site POC requests assistance testing the logical link.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  A post-init routine IB20P475 was created to check for the test account
  vs. the production account and populate the TCP/IP address connected to
  the new server at the FSC accordingly.
