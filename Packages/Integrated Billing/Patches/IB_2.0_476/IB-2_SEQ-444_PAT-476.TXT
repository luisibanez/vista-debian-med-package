Subject: FEE PROVIDER AUTOMATION TO IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER (#355.93) File

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch begins the process of automating Fee Basis (FB) claims to
 Integrating Billing (IB) bills.  It includes a new API that is called
 by Fee Basis code to update the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER
 #355.93) file with provider information from Fee Basis files. It also
 includes modifications to two IB screens where Non-VA Provider 
 information is entered to allow a user to allow/disallow record updates
 by the Fee Basis Payment to IB [FB PAID TO IB] nightly job which is 
 introduced in FB*3.5*135.
  
 This patch requires IB*2.0*400 and IB*2.0*432.
  
 *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
 Associated patch FB*3.5*135 requires IB*2.0*476 to be installed first.
 Once installed, FB*3.5*135 must be installed immediately after.
  
 FB*3.5*135 and this patch (IB*2.0*476) have enhancements to FB and IB
 that represent partial automation of Fee vendors and 5010 providers 
 (For Future Use). These enhancements were tested at the test sites and
 will be rolled out nationally, but not "turned on" (no post install).
 Future patches will build upon the baseline functionality established 
 in these patches.
  
  
 Enhancements to Integrated Billing v2.0
 ---------------------------------------
 *** All of the below are for future use.***
  
 1. The input transforms on two fields in the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING
    PROVIDER (#355.93) file were modified to allow the Fee Basis
    Payment to IB [FB PAID TO IB] background job make updates to the 
    fields:
      PRVFMT^IBCEP8 was modified for the NAME (#.01) field
      NPIUSED^IBCEP81 was modified for the NPI (#41.01) field
  
 2. A new routine IBCEP8C contains the API EPFBAPI that is called by the
    Fee Basis Payment to IB [FB PAID TO IB] background job to add/edit IB
    providers. Supporting functions include a lookup of existing records
    in the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER (#355.93) file using the
    NPI provided by Fee Basis records. Other functions include the
    ability to compare and update a matched record when required, and
    functions to create a new entry.  The new field (#50) DATE/TIME LAST
    FB UPDATE is edited during the automated process to allow tracking
    and reporting of IB providers edited by Fee Basis.
  
 3. Routines IBCEP8 and IBCEP8B have been modified to display and update a
    new multiple valued field, DATE/TIME ALLOW FB UPDATE (#51) in the
    IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER (#355.93) file. A new routine,
    IBCEP8C1 provides supporting code for this functionality. The new
    field allows an IB user to 'allow' or 'disallow' automated updates
    from Fee Basis.  The modified routines are accessed by the Provider ID 
    Maintenance [IBCE PROVIDER MAINT] option under the Non-VA Provider
    screens in IB.
  
 4. A new menu option, IB Provider From FB Reports Menu [IB PROVIDER FROM
    FB RPTS MENU] has been created that contain two new reporting options
    that provide tools to locate and display information about records
    modified or created by the Fee Basis Payment to IB  [FB PAID TO IB]
    interface for a date range. This menu is not available on any existing
    IB menus, but could be added to a menu or secondary menu for an IB user
    or supervisor.
    The report options available on this menu are:
     Non-VA Provider From FB Summary Report [IB PROVIDER FROM FB SUMMARY]
     Non-VA Provider From FB Detail Report [IB PROVIDER FROM FB DETAIL]

 20090705 VistA Fee HIPAA 5010 Implementation, Discovery and Requirements
          To meet the expanding needs of Electronic Data Interchange
          (EDI) processes and address the system and data changes
          required with the 5010 version, the Fee Basis package will need
          to collect, store and report additional elements from the claim
          data.  National Provider Identifiers (NPI) and physical service
          locations are needed to better inform downstream or dependent
          processes.  Much of the additional data collection is needed to
          support (1) revenue functions, where a third party insurance
          has a financial obligation surrounding payments made for
          non-service connected episodes of care and (2) pricing
          functions, where the service location impacts the allowed
          amount for a healthcare service.
