Subject: UPDATE FOR UNSUPPORTED ICD FIELD

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs) have been created to facilitate
 the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th
 Edition (ICD10) project.  These APIs replace direct global reads to
 unsupported fields in the ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) file.  This patch will use
 these APIs in order to obtain information from the file instead of
 performing a direct read of the ^ICD9 global.
  
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY:
 ==================
 INC0000000605329 IB CODE CONTAINS DIRECT GLOBAL READS TO THE ^ICD9 GLOBAL

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 INC0000000605329 IB CODE CONTAINS DIRECT GLOBAL READS TO THE ^ICD9 GLOBAL 
  
    Problem:   
    --------
    Direct global reads to the DIAGNOSIS (#3) field in the ICD DIAGNOSIS
    file (#80) are not supported and need to be replaced in order for the
    software to function properly. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE (1) field (#64) contained an unsupported direct
    global read.  This field was already marked for deletion and this patch 
    corrects the unsupported read by deleting this field.  
  
    Technical:
    ----------
    To delete the field properly, current values of the ICD DIAGNOSIS 
    CODE (1) field (#64) were set to null for all entries in the 
    BILL/CLAIMS file (#399).  The ICD DIAGNOSIS CODE (1) field (#64) was then 
    removed from the Data Dictionary.  The trigger for this field contained 
    the code that performed a direct read to the unsupported field within the 
    ^ICD9 global.  The IBXX* cross reference routines for the BILL/CLAIMS 
    file (#399) were then recompiled.  These actions removed the direct global 
    read of the unsupported field within the ^ICD9 global.
