Description:
============

 *************************************************************************
 PLEASE NOTE: There is a shortened Compliance Date for this patch.
 *************************************************************************
  
 This patch is an informational patch about reloading the replacement of 
 the Reasonable Charges host files.
  
 The replacement host files are available and these new host files have to
 be retrieved from anonymous and reloaded - even though IB*2*491 has been
 installed.

 OVERVIEW OF REMEDY TICKETS(s):
 ==============================
 INC000000840389 Integrated Billing - Reasonable Charges
  
  Problem:
  --------
  The Chief Business Office has requested that sites reload the replacement
  Reasonable Charges host files now that LEX*2.0*90 has been released.
  
  Resolution:
  -----------
  The Facility Charge (CPT) host file and the Physician Charges (CPT) host
  file have been updated to remove 121 inactive CPT/HCPCS codes which are
  currently inactivated in the CPT (#81) file, turn on the outpatient
  facility charges for 729 CPT/HCPCS codes and change the professional
  charge type for 42 CPT/HCPCS codes to make their charges available when
  the reload process is complete.
  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
 No installation is needed.
  
 ********************** RC v3.12 Upload Instructions ********************
  
 A typical upload of Reasonable Charges require approximately 1.8 - 2.0 MB 
 of disk space for each Division. This re-load will not require as much 
 space because most of the charges for 01/01/2013 are already on the file. 
 Other files will be searched, but the new charges data will only be added 
 to the Charge Item (#363) file.
  
 LEX*2.0*90 - Code Set FY13 3rd Qtr Update should be installed before 
 uploading Reasonable Charges v3.12 host files.
  
 Files Required for Upload:
 --------------------------
 The charge files are available on the following CIO Field Offices'
 Anonymous.Software directories.  Use the appropriate FTP capability to 
 retrieve the files (ASCII).

 Upload Steps:
 =============
  
 Step 1:  Get Host Files
 -----------------------
 Delete the old .txt files you may still have on your system from 
 uploading for patch IB*2*491. Then retrieve the new Host Files in ASCII
 format (see previous section for file sizes).
  
 Step 2:  Determine Divisions
 ----------------------------
 Use the Print Charge Master [IBCR REPORTS FOR CHARGE MASTER] option and 
 print the Billing Regions report to find which Billing Regions and 
 Divisions have charges loaded onto your system.  These are the divisions 
 that will need new charges loaded.
  
 Step 3:  Begin Upload Process
 -----------------------------
 Use the Load Host File into Charge Master [IBCR HOST FILE LOAD] option 
 to load Reasonable Charges onto your system for every division for which
 care is billed at your site. Carefully follow the instructions below, for 
 each Billing Region.
  
 You will see the prompt:
  
       Select one of the following:
 ============================================================================
             1.1       Load CMAC into XTMP
             1.2       Load AWP into XTMP
             1.3       Load RC into XTMP
             1.4       Load TP into XTMP
             2         Assign Charge Set
             3         Check Data Validity
             4         Load into Charge Master
             5         Delete XTMP files
                                        
 Below, in more detail, the steps will guide you through the process of 
 selecting first 1.3, then 3, then 4, and waiting until 4 stops before 
 continuing on to the next division (and capturing or printing all output 
 for future reference).
  
 Step 4:  Load the Reasonable Charges
 ------------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 1.3 - Load RC into XTMP
  
 This loads the Host Files into temporary storage and calculates charges
 for individual Divisions.
  
   - If there are no previously existing host files loaded, it will ask 
     which version of Reasonable Charges to load.    
     Select 3.12
  
   - When loading Reasonable Charges v3.12 the IBRC1301x.TXT files may be 
     used for multiple divisions without reloading. The first time 
     through even though the files will match the IBRC1301x.TXT format,
     they should be deleted so the new files can be uploaded.
  
   - If there exists any previously calculated charges (files) for a 
     division, they will be displayed, and you will get the prompt:
   
         The above files already exist in XTMP.
         Delete the above files and continue with upload?
     Select Yes, to delete the previously calculated charges.
  
   - Select Division:  Select the division number to load charges for. 
     This should correspond to the Divisions associated with the Billing 
     Regions determined previously.  Once the correct division is 
     selected, answer Yes to Calculate Charges.
  
 Step 5: Check Data Validity
 ---------------------------
 From the menu, select option 3 - Check Data Validity.
 This is optional, but it is suggested that it be run at least once, for 
 the first division loaded.
  
 If the resulting report has any Line Data Errors, then check that the
 latest version of CPT and DRG has been installed.  The Error key at the
 end of the report does not mean that errors have occurred.  It simply
 provides definitions of the types of errors that might occur.  Check the
 individual line items in the report to see if any of the listed errors
 have been detected.
  
 Step 6: Load into Charge Master
 -------------------------------
 From the menu, select option 4 - Load into Charge Master
 Moves the charges calculated in selection 1.3 to permanent storage in the 
 Charge Master.  The results report should match the examples below.
  
 It is important that this option completes before continuing.  Allow the 
 upload of a division's charges to finish before attempting to upload 
 another division.  A summary report will be printed when the upload is 
 complete.  This option uses the same temporary files to calculate the
 charges for all divisions, therefore they must be calculated and loaded 
 serially.  
                                        
 Step 7: Repeat steps 4-6 for each Division needed
 -------------------------------------------------
 Steps 4-6 must be repeated for each division billed at your site.  Refer 
 to the Divisions that already have charges assigned using the Billing 
 Region Report list determined previously.
  
 In most cases, simply using the above options for loading Reasonable
 Charges will result in the correct set up in the Charge Master. 
  
 -  Option 1.3, to calculate charges for a division
 -  Option 4, to load those calculated charges into the Charge Master 
    permanent files.
                                        
 However, if you are loading charges for a new site, or a site that may 
 have changed its division number, then extra care is needed to ensure 
 the setup of the Charge Master is correct. The following sections provide 
 examples of displays and reports for the upload.
