Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*385
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*452
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*11
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*73
  
 The patches (PSO*7*385, IB*2*452, BPS*1*11, and PSX*2*73) are being released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB PSX BUNDLE 7.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates and to address and correct gaps and 
 inefficiencies in the current electronic pharmacy billing processes.  This 
 will ultimately increase revenues collected by VA Medical Centers and 
 outpatient pharmacies by reducing the volume of short pays and payment 
 denials.
  
 All pharmacy claims for payers that are processed electronically are 
 compliant with the current industry standards.  This software adds support 
 for the electronic billing of the Health Administration Center (HAC) CHAMPVA 
 payer in order to provide an automated process and to prevent manual 
 workarounds for CHAMPVA.
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. Add IB support for CHAMPVA ePharmacy insurance and CHAMPVA patient
     eligibility, and process CHAMPVA ePharmacy prescriptions using the 
     CHAMPVA rate type.
  
  2. Add a new Claims Tracking Reason Not Billable (RNB) for CHAMPVA, 
     inpatient prescriptions.
  
  3. Enhance the ECME Billing Events Report option [IB ECME BILLING EVENTS] as 
     follows:
      a. Add patient eligibility (VETERAN, TRICARE, CHAMPVA)
      b. Display the NCPDP quantity and units when available and also the 
         Billed quantity and units
      c. Display a break-out of all fees and costs associated with each 
         prescription
      d. Display a break-out of the payer-reported amounts paid in the ECME
         response for each prescription
  
  4. Create a bill in IB and AR when a DUPLICATE ECME response is received and 
     only when a non-cancelled bill with the same Rx#, fill#, and payer 
     sequence doesn't already exist.
  
  5. Add the display of the ECME# to several existing reports, screens, and 
     MailMan messages that currently only show the Rx#.
  
  6. Add fields and prompts for the Pharmacy Relationship Code and for the 
     Pharmacy Person Code in both the Process Insurance Buffer [IBCN INSURANCE 
     BUFFER PROCESS] option and in the Patient Insurance Info View/Edit [IBCN 
     PATIENT INSURANCE] option.
  
  7. Add a new Claims Tracking Reason Not Billable (RNB) for 
     Auto-Reversals for Inpatient Prescriptions. Previous to this patch, 
     the RNB for this situation was being filed by the system as OTHER.

 Documentation Retrieval Instructions
 ------------------------------------
 Updated documentation describing the new functionality introduced by this
 patch is available.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from
 ftp://download.vista.med.va.gov. This transmits the files from the first
 available FTP server. Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from
 a specific server as follows:
  
  Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
  Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named IBY452PO.
 The purpose of the post-install routine is to create one new entry in the
 CLAIMS TRACKING NON-BILLABLE REASONS file (#356.8).  The new entry is named
 CHAMPVA INPATIENT/DISCHARGE and it is automatically used by the IB billing
 determination process when processing a CHAMPVA, inpatient prescription.
 These prescriptions are non-billable.
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by
 your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete routine 
 IBY452PO if the installation was successful and it is not automatically 
 deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take up to 20 minutes to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted
        to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish or complete the
        installation before the transmissions start. Both the CS
        (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission options
        should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your Pharmacy
        ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
               ***** IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES *****
  
 This patch bundle is changing the name of File #52.87.  The current name of
 this file is 'PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG'.  The new name of this file is 'PSO AUDIT
 LOG'.  During the patch installation you will see the following information
 presented to the screen:
  
       52.87     PSO AUDIT LOG
    *BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE 'PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG' AS FILE #52.87!
    Shall I write over your PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG File? YES//
  
 Please accept the default answer of YES to this question.
  
 You will also be prompted to enter the coordinator for the new BPS CHAMPVA
 mail group.  Prior to installation, please contact your Medical Care Cost
 Recovery (MCCR) business department (Facility Revenue Manager) to
 determine who will be the coordinator for this new mail group.  The users
 in this mail group will receive bulletins related to the processing of
 CHAMPVA electronic claims.  After the patch is installed, members can be
 added to the mail group by using the Mail Group Edit [XMEDITMG] option.
