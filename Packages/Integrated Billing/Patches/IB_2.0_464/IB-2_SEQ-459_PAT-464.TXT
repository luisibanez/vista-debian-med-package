 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000307061 NOT ABLE TO EDIT SC CARE PR OMPT FOR SOME PTS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site reported within the [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option that they were not 
 able to get the 'SC AT THE TIME OF CARE' edit prompt to display if the 
 patient had an extremely large number of rated disabilities. The list 
 goes into an infinite loop and never allows the user to access the prompt 
 to edit it. The user's only option is to '^' out of the list which exits 
 the 'SC AT THE TIME OF CARE' prompt altogether.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The variable Y was reset in the input template [IB SCREEN1] to get the
 'SC AT THE TIME OF CARE' prompt to display when they reach the end of the 
 list of rated disabilities. A post-init routine IB20P464 was created to
 recompile the input template for the data dictionary item affected by the
 patch.
  
 2. HD0000000598658 Misspelling in '(Enter '6' to list disabilites)'
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A typo was found in the help message associated with the SC Care field on
 screen <1> in the [IB EDIT BILLING INFO] option when Service Connected
 care for disability conditions are provided.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine IBCSC1 to correct the typo in the help message for the SC
 Care field on screen <1> in the IB option.
  
 3. HD0000000220815 bulletin misspelling
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The bulletin subject line with misspelled text 'REIVEW' was sent when the
 IB nightly background job passing the charge pending review to the Accounts
 Receivable package was completed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified routine IBOHRL to correct the misspelled text in the bulletin
 subject line.
