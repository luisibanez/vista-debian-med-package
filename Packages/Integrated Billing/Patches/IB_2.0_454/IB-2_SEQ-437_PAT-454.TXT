 On May 5, 2010, the President signed into law, Public Law (PL) 111-163, 
 the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.  This law
 provides assistance to caregivers of Veterans and improves the provisions
 of health care services to Veterans.  Section 511, Prohibitions on
 collections of certain copayments from Veterans who are Catastrophically
 Disabled.  Some of the provisions were implemented with the install of 
 IB*2*449.  This patch will implement the remainder of the copayment 
 related provisions.
  
 With the install of this patch, Veterans who are identified as being 
 Catastrophically Disabled will no longer be charged copayments for 
 Non-Institutional (Outpatient) Extended Care/Long Term Care from the
 effective date of their Catastrophically Disabled determination and
 installation forward.  This patch does not cancel charges created prior to
 the install, sites should continue to use the CBO guidance they have been
 provided to cancel those previously billed charges where necessary.
