   ******************************************************************
   *                                                                *
   *  PRCA*4.5*270 must be installed prior to installing IB*2*433.  *
   *                                                                *
   ******************************************************************
  
  
 This release will provide a new Integrated Billing (IB) option that will 
 allow users to correct rejected or denied claims to third party insurance
 companies, while maintaining the original claim number. The purpose of
 this patch, along with PRCA*4.5*270, is to provide the ability for sites
 to correct claims that have been either rejected at some stage in the
 processing of the claim or adjudicated by the payer and denied for a
 correctable reason, and to have the corrected version of the claim
 maintain the original claim number. Once corrected, the site can then
 resubmit the claim, electronically or by mail, to the payer for
 reprocessing. 
  
 The changes are primarily to the IB module. Because there is a 
 correlation between claim numbers in IB and in Accounts Receivable (AR),
 the accompanying AR patch, PRCA*4.5*270, modifies the BILL NO. field
 (#.01) of the ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE file (#430) to support adding the
 iteration number to the claim number of the original claim once it has
 been cancelled via the new correction process. This patch, IB*2*433, 
 contains the new Correct Rejected/Denied Claim menu option and protocol, 
 as well as the routines to support this new function. In addition, it  
 adds a new security key, IB CLON, which locks the Copy and Cancel [IB COPY
 AND CANCEL] menu option to limit future use of this existing option.
  
 The new option, Correct Rejected/Denied Bill [IB CORRECT REJECTED/DENIED]  
 will be added to the following locations:
  
 1. Third Party Billing Menu ... [IB THIRD PARTY BILLING MENU]
 2. CSA - Claims Status Awaiting Resolution [IBCE CLAIMS STATUS AWAITING]
 3. MRW - MRA Management WorkList [IBCE MRA MANAGEMENT]
  
 This new option will function similar to the existing Copy and Cancel 
 option [IB COPY AND CANCEL]. It is used to correct claims that have been 
 rejected at any stage in the claims processing by Financial Services
 Center (FSC), Emdeon, or Insurance Company, or denied by the insurance 
 company. The old claim will be cancelled & renamed with the original claim
 number plus an incremental #, KXXXXXX-01. A new claim, which is a copy of
 the original claim, will be created and will maintain the original claim
 number. This option can NOT be used to correct a claim if any payment has
 been posted to the claim in AR, or if the claim/account is a non-accrued 
 Billing type (such as a Tricare claim). If either of these are true, then
 the old Copy and Cancel option [IB COPY AND CANCEL] must be used.
  
 This is a result from business needs identified by the Chief Business
 Office (CBO). The ability to resubmit a rejected/denied claim with the
 original claim number is normal process for most of the industry. This
 ability will also provide the ability to better track the processing of
 claims as it provides the ability to follow claims through the
 resubmission process and track the changes that were required as a result
 of a rejection or denial.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 This patch introduces a new security key, IB CLON. The intent of this key
 is to lock out users from the old CLON menu option and encourage them to
 use the new CRD menu option introduced with this patch. The only time a
 user would still need to use CLON is in the rare circumstance where a
 claim needs to be corrected and a payment has already been posted to it,  
 or when correcting non-accrued Billing types such as Tricare claims.
 It is recommended that the assignment of this key be limited. Please have
 the Billing Supervisor determine to whom the key should be assigned when
 the patch is installed.
