Subject: HIPAA 5010-MRA & DUAL PROVIDER STATUS & LEGAL CLAIMS

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch will cover HIPAA 5010 - AR FOR MEDICARE POLICY TYPE,
 DUAL PROVIDER STATUS & ENTITY TYPE, and LEGAL CLAIMS AND THE NPI.
  
  A. AR FOR MEDICARE POLICY TYPE:
     ---------------------------
  
     The IB and AR modules are integrated parts of the overall VistA
     system that exists at each site.  The IB and AR modules make use
     of FileMan and MailMan.  The IB module receives a MailMan message
     containing the flatfile 835 (MRA) via the VA Financial Service
     Center in Austin, TX from Medicare.  In addition, the IB module
     transmits the flat-file 837 Health Care Claim data to the VA Financial
     Service Center in Austin, TX via MailMan.
  
     The scope of this enhancement is to manage the requirements for the
     VistA system's IB module as specified below:
  
   1. Create a new plan type in VistA to accommodate MediGap plan (F&G).
      "MEDIGAP (SUPPL - COINS, DED, PART B EXC)"
  
   2. When the Medicare Remittance Advice (MRA) is returned:
  
      All MRA secondary insurance claims will be billed the patient
      responsibility amount unless one of the following conditions is true.
      If an MRA, and the claim is an OUTPATIENT claim and the MRA
      secondary insurance plan type is NOT "MEDIGAP (SUPPLEMENTAL)" then
      the secondary insurance claim will be billed under the new
      calculation of patient responsibility PLUS MediGap unpaid amount.  If
      an MRA, and the claim is an INPATIENT PROFESSIONAL claim
      (professional means the same thing as Part B and the same thing as a
      CMS1500) and the MRA secondary insurance plan type is NOT "MEDIGAP
      (SUPPLEMENTAL)" then the secondary insurance claim will be billed 
      under the new calculation of patient responsibility PLUS MediGap
      unpaid amount.
  
      Therefore, for those MRA secondary insurance's whose plan type is the
      new one for MEDIGAP PLAN F & MEDIGAP PLAN G - only Outpatient claims
      and INPATIENT Professional claims will fall in the new calculation of
      of patient responsibility PLUS MediGap unpaid amount.  All inpatient
      UB04 claims with this new plan type for MEDIGAP PLAN F & MEDIGAP 
      PLAN G will use the original calculation of patient responsibility.
  
 B. DUAL PROVIDER STATUS & ENTITY TYPE:
    ---------------------------------- 
  
   The scope of this enhancement is to manage the requirements for the
   VistA system's IB module as specified below:
  
   1. To allow for entry and storage of a given provider's name (Last,
      First Middle) to exist in identical content and format in the NEW
      PERSON file (#200) and the IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file
      (#355.93).
  
   2. To allow the use of a comma in Non-VA Facility names.
      
   3. A clean-up effort is required during the patch installation process:
  
          Synchronize values between the NEW PERSON File (#200) and the
          IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER File (#355.93). This utility
          is run one time during the installation process to compare
          the Provider Name values using the NPI as the common field.
          When differences are identified, the provider name in the NEW
          PERSON file will be copied to the provider name field of the
          IB NON/OTHER VA BILLING PROVIDER file.
  
    4. Create a one-time report of all the changes resulting from the
       aforementioned installation utility.
  
    5. Email the above report to those users with the "IB PROVIDER EDIT"
       security key.
  
 C. LEGAL CLAIMS AND THE NPI:
    ------------------------
  
   NOTE: For the purpose of these requirements, legal claims will be
   defined as a Billing Rate Type of "NO FAULT INS.", "WORKERS' COMP.",
   and "TORT FEASOR".
  
   The scope of this enhancement is to manage the requirements for the
   VistA System's IB module as specified below to allow for the:
  
    1. Ability to authorize specified legal claims lacking an NPI.
  
    2. Ability to locally print legal claims lacking an NPI.
  
    3. Ability to locally print legal claims with any NPI, if any NPI is
       available.
  
    4. Ability to ensure that if the "NO FAULT INS.", "WORKERS' COMP."
       or "TORT FEASOR" claim is ultimately deemed billable to third-party
       insurance that the requirement for the NPI remains.
