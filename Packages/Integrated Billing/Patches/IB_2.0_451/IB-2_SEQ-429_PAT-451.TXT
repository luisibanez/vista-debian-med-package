 The Chief Business Office (CBO) in the Veterans Health Administration 
 (VHA), requested enhancements to the Integrated Billing (IB) system
 software in order to augment payment processing efficiencies at individual
 VA Medical Center accounts. The changes distributed with this patch affect
 reporting options used daily in the delivery of benefits and services
 provided to the patient population.
  
 Improvements to management reporting and additional automation of business
 process will support VHA performance measures and compliance policies to
 ensure fiscal accuracy and accountability.
  
 The project has two patches (PRCA*4.5*276 and IB*2*451), which are being
 released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) using 
 single build distributions.

 INQUIRY].
  
  
 Changes on the EDI Lockbox Menu

 The new option EEOB Move/Copy [RCDPE EEOB MOVE/COPY], which is part of the
 EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) Lockbox menu [RCDPE EDI LOCKBOX MENU],
 provides new functionality to enable the user to move an EEOB to another
 claim, and to copy an EEOB and clone it to several claims. The routine
 IBCEOB4 is being released to support this new functionality in Accounts
 Receivable.

    EOB MOVE/COPY BY

 Additionally, the Accounts Receivable and Integrated Billing systems

    Bill Charges screen of TPJI
    Comment History screen of TPJI  
    View/Print EEOB screen of the EEOB Worklist

    First Party Follow-Up Report    [IBJD FOLLOW-UP FIRST PARTY]
    List All Bills For a Patient    [IB LIST ALL BILLS FOR PAT]
    Insurance Payment Trend Report  [IB OUTPUT TREND REPORT]
    Bill Charges                    [IBJ THIRD PARTY JOINT INQUIRY]
