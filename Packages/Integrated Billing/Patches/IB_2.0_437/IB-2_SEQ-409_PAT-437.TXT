Description:
============

 
     ****    PLEASE NOTE:  the compliance date is March 4, 2011  *** 
 
  This patch aids VHA to be compliant with the current structure for charges 
  for third party pharmacy prescription claims under federal regulations 38 
  CFR 17.101 and 38 CFR 17.102.  The software modifications in this patch 
  will align VHA with industry methods of charging, billing and recovery of 
  drug costs.  The patch supports the modifications to the federal 
  regulations which change the methodology for these third party pharmacy 
  charges to a methodology that allows VHA to charge a rate based on cost of 
  the drugs. 
  
  Federal regulations have been changed to modify the methodology for billing 
  prescription costs to third party payers for outpatient prescriptions.  
  Based on federal regulations VHA will bill third party payers for 
  outpatient prescriptions at VA Prescription Cost and apply an 
  administration fee for each prescription filled.  Currently, there is a 
  flat rate of $51.00 per prescription to third party payers for outpatient 
  prescriptions and no administration fee is applied.
   
  The following Rate Types shall be updated to be billed at VA Prescription 
  Cost plus an Administrative Fee:
  
  1.     Reimbursable Insurance
  2.     No Fault Insurance
  3.     Tort Feasor
  4.     Workers Compensation.

 The enhancements made by this patch are summarized below:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
   
 Rate Schedules Updates
 ----------------------
 
 Definition: DISPENSING FEE. This is a flat amount or a percentage
 of the drug cost that is paid to the pharmacist for the labor and
 administrative effort provided.
 
 This project uses the DISPENSING FEE field (# 1.01) in the Rate 
 Schedules file (#363) to store the administrative fee of $11.40. 
 
 The post-init routine, IB20P437, will inactivate rate schedules that 
 contain TL Fill charge sets for the rate types Reimbursable Insurance, No 
 Fault Insurance, Tort Feasor and Workers Compensation with an inactive date 
 of March 17, 2011.  The routine adds new rate schedules for the rate types 
 defined above, setting the activation date to March 18, 2011 and adds a 
 dispense fee of $11.40 and includes the dispense fee in the 
 adjustment field (#10).  When rate schedules inactivated by this procedure 
 also contain additional charge sets other than TL Fill then a separate rate 
 schedule is created with those additional charge sets and the original rate 
 schedule name, fees and adjustments are maintained with an activation date 
 of March 18, 2011.
 
 Use of EPHARMACY API (# 4299)
 --------------------------------
  Although no change to the parameters for the e-pharmacy API 4299 are
  being made by this patch, there is an update to the underlying code in
  order to return VA's cost and the administrative fee for third party
  prescriptions.  The code is modified to use the charge master to look up
  the basis for the charge, by effective date, which is either VA Cost +
  admin Fee or $51 flat rate. Existing parameters in the interface are used
  to return the correct charge. 
 
 Updates to Manual Billing:
 --------------------------
  Updates to the rate schedules described above will result in the VA cost 
  plus admin fee being included on the bill total, which appears on the 
  Billing - General Information Screen of the option Enter/Edit Billing 
  Information [IB EDIT BILLING INFO].  This applies to 3rd party pharmacy 
  prescription bills with a prescription fill or refill on or after March 18, 
  2011.
 
 Updates to Reports
 ------------------
  The following reports have been updated to correctly use the Charge
  Master to look up the total charge (cost plus administrative fee) for
  prescription claims that have a prescription with a fill or refill date
  on or after March 18, 2011. 
 
      1. Re-Generate Unbilled Amounts Report [IBT RE-GEN UNBILLED REPORT]
      2. Reasons Not Billable Report [IBJD REASONS NOT BILLABLE]
 
 Annual Updates of the Administrative Fee
 -----------------------------------------
  A new procedure is included with this patch that provides a callable entry 
  point to update rate schedules in subsequent years.  It is intended that 
  this procedure will be called by a post-install routine of future patches 
  to update the dispensing fee field (#1.01) for the new administrative fee
  for third party pharmacy prescriptions.  Below is the specification of the
  procedure. 
  
  
 COMPONENT: ENT^IB3PSOU (IBRATY,IBDFFDT,IBADFE,IBDISP,IBADJUST)
 ----------
 
  Procedure updates rate schedules for default rate types or types
  specified in IBRATY by inactivating currently active rate schedules with
  date ( IBDFFDT-1 ) that contain either RX Cost or TL Fill charge sets. 
  Procedure adds new rate schedules for the rate types defined, setting the
  activation date to IBDFFDT and updating any defined Fees or adjustment. 
  When rate schedules updated by this procedure also contain additional
  charge sets other than RX Cost or TL Fill then a separate rate schedule
  is created with those additional charge sets and the original fees and
  adjustments are maintained. 
  
 Default Rate Types:  REIMBURSABLE INS.
                      NO FAULT INS.
                      TORT FEASOR
                      WORKERS' COMP.
 
 Input parameters:
 
   IBRATY: (optional)    Rate type names separated by ^.  If defined use these 
                         rate types instead of default types.
   IBDFFDT: (required)   Effective date in form mm/dd/yyyy for new rate 
                         schedules.
   IBADFE:  (optional)    not currently in use.
   IBDISP:  (required)   Dispense Fee: to contain the new annual administrative
                         fee for rate schedules.
   IBADJUST: (optional)  If defined must be MUMPS code to define a unique 
                         adjustment to the rate schedule.  If not defined 
                         default is S X = X + $G(ABADFE) + $G(IBDISP).
 
 EXAMPLE CALL:
 ------------- 
 For example, if in 2011 CBO intends to establish a new administrative fee, 
 effective December 01, 2011, at $14.50 and the fee will be applied to the 
 same rate types as the original patch then all that is required to update 
 the fee is the following call:
 
      D ENT^IB3PSOU(,"12/01/2011",0,11.40,)
