Description:
============

 *********************************ATTENTION***********************************
 Note:  This patch is an emergency released with a 48-hour compliance.
   
        This patch is being released in support of the Enrollment System
        Re-design (ESR) 3.5 Public Law 111-163 project.  IB*2*449 is being
        released along with DG*5.3*840 (Registration) and IVM*2*149 (Income
        Verification Match) in host file: DG_53_P840.KID.
   
        It is imperative that these patches be installed no later than the
        compliance date.  Your understanding and support is appreciated.
 **************************************************************************
  
 On May 5, 2010, the President signed into law, Public Law (PL) 111-163, 
 the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.  This law
 provides assistance to caregivers of Veterans and improves the provisions
 of health care services to Veterans.  Section 511, Prohibitions on
 collections of copayments from Veterans who are Catastrophically
 Disabled.  This patch is being issued in support of some of these
 provisions.
  
 With the install of this patch and the other related patches (DG*5.3*840 
 and IVM*2*149), Veterans who are identified as being Catastrophically
 Disabled will no longer be charged copayments for Means Test/Geographic
 Means Test related Outpatient Visits, Inpatient Visits and Outpatient
 Medications from the effective date of their Catastrophically Disabled
 determination and installation forward.  This does not affect Extended
 Care/Long Term Care Copayments.  These patches do not cancel charges
 created prior to the install, sites should continue to use the CBO
 guidance they have been provided to cancel those previously billed charges
 where necessary.
  
 To provide support for the cancellation of charges that have occurred 
 since the effective date of May 5, 2010 for Catastrophically Disabled, a
 new Reasons Not Billable is being added to the IB CHARGE REMOVE REASONS
 (#350.3) for selection during all types of cancellations of copayments:
  
       CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED
  
 To assist in identifying charges already created for Catastrophically 
 Disabled patients, a new report Catastrophically Disabled Copay Report [IB
 CD CHARGE REPORT] is being added to the Patient Billing Reports Menu [IB
 OUTPUT PATIENT REPORT MENU].  During installation of this patch the report
 will be produced automatically for charges that were created since May 5,
 2010 and the patient's Catastrophically Disability effective date.  This
 report needs a printer of at least 132 columns.  It is important this
 report is shared with the site's revenue department.  If needed the report
 can be re-run by the new menu option.
  
 Report Option Details:
  - The report is based on the Date of Decision date stored in the Patient
    (#2) file.
  - Even though charges may be cancelled, the report may continue to show
    $0 charges.  If the charge in IB is cancelled but there are still 
    charges on the AR side on the same bill number they will continue to 
    appear on the report.  This is because there is no way of determining 
    which charges on an AR bill are actually cancelled vs not cancelled.  
    Sites should not expect to see a clean report, the report is for 
    informational purposes for review.  After review of a specified
    timeframe is completed it is recommended sites use subsequent
    timeframes for review.
  
  
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
 ============================
 1. HD0000000469489 - add a new cancellation reason Catastrophically 
 Disabled 
  
 Problem:
 -------
 Patients who were designated as catastrophically disabled no longer have 
 to pay copayments and are going to be reimbursed for co-payments back to
 May of 2010.  Site is requesting to add this as a cancellation reason for
 selection when cancellation occurs.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 With the install of this patch all a new cancellation reason will be made
 available for selection.

 The enhancements made by this patch are summarized below:

 A new Exemption Reason (#354.2) file entry is being added by the 
 post-install of this patch (IB20P449) of CATASTROPHICALLY DISABLED.
  
  
 Exemption Update
 ----------------
 The exemption processing routine (IBARXEU1) is being updated to include 
 an additional data element for evaluation of Outpatient Medication 
 Copayment exemption.  The associated DG*5.3*840 patch will include an

 IB will use that additional data element to automatically exempt 
 Catastrophically Disabled patients using the new Exemption Reason.

      following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
      descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
      the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
