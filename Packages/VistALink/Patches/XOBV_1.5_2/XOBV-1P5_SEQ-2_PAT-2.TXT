  - Informational

Description:
============

 VISTA SITES NEED NOT INSTALL ANY PATCH ON THE M SIDE FOR THIS. THIS PATCH
 WILL BE INSTALLED ONLY ON THE CENTRALIZED (J2EE) SERVER.
 The patch contains updates to the java components only. While it contains 
 a full Java side VistALink distribution, an M side component -
 XOB_1_5.KID build was removed from the package to avoid confusion and
 accidental downgrading of the installation.
  
 If you are performing a brand new VistALink 1.5 installation, install 
 XOBV*1.5*0, followed by XOBV*1.5*1. If you are performing an upgrade,
 there is no need to do anything on the M side, since there are no updates
 to the routines in this patch.
  
 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1. A fix for internal caching of DNS resolved entries. A fix has to do 
 with the fact that due to caching of resolved IP addresses by 
 the VistALink code, several sites have reported connectivity problems
 after DNS information was changed and connectors were not redeployed.
 Caching has been disabled and from now on it is being controlled by the
 corresponding settings of an underlying JVM. The values controlling the 
 Caching Policy of the JVM the Connector is running on are being displayed
 on the Connector Detail page of VistALink Console as well. Refer to the 
 corresponding Console's Online Help pages for more information. 
  
 2. Introduction of additional security contraints to the VistALink 
 Console. The request came from the personnel supporting the production 
 sites. Members of the WebLogic's Monitors role will be able to navigate 
 to Connector Details pages, but not to the Connector Configuration 
 section of the console.
