 This informational patch is issued as directed in Memorandum:  Open 
 Source VistA Deployment (VAIQ #7256522), dated Aug 31, 2012.  Refer to 
 this document for specific details.
  
 The VistA Standardization term, in this context, represents M routines 
 only, baselined as the nationally released version of a specific package 
 for the timeline involved.  (see Official Checksum heading below for 
 timeline date)
  
 A review of the VistA Standardization routines was completed for
 VISTALINK, version 1.6. These routines will be the baseline used for
 standardization purposes across all sites.  A list of the routines and
 their official checksums is included below.  VistA Standardization 
 Certification represents the matching of the routine checksums compared.  
 Note:  environment check routines, pre installation routines, post 
 installation routines, and compiled cross-reference routines are not 
 considered for Certification purposes.
  
 VistA Standardization Certification represents the site's Production 
 account only.
  
 For sites with no variance from the baseline checksums, you will be 
 identified as VistA Standardization Certified for the package.  No 
 additional action is required.  Environment check routines, pre 
 installation routines, or post installation routines remaining from 
 previously installed patches, or even prior package version routines, do 
 not affect your site's standardization compliance.  Their existence, or 
 non-existence, on either your site, or the VistA Standardization routines 
 list below, has no impact on VistA Standardization Certification.
  
 Note:  VistA Standardization Certification for this package applies to 
 the snapshot in time specified in the Official Checksum heading below.  
 If additional patches, or a newer version for the package, has been 
 released since this date, the checksums for affected routines will be 
 different.  For these routines, refer to the patch/version documentation 
 for the most up-to-date checksums.

 ====================================================================
  
 For sites with checksum variation, the site must either:
   -  remediate to become VistA Standardization Certified, (contact your 
      Regional Operation Center (ROC) or log a Remedy Ticket for
      remediation assistance)
   or
   -  obtain a waiver, which allows retention of local modifications 
      to a VistA Standardization routine, as detailed in VA Directive 6402
