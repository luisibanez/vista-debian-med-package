Subject: DO NOT RESUSCITATE (DNR) DISPLAY PROBLEMS & DUPLICATE PATIENT DISPLAY ISSUE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Shift Hand Off Tool was released as a new package (CRHD*1) install on 
 June 26, 2008.
  
 CRHD*1*2 is the first maintenance patch released for the Shift HandOff 
 Tool package.
  
 If you have not installed the SHIFT HANDOFF TOOL KIDS Package  (CRHD*1)  
 please refer to the Install guide located on the VistA Documentation
 Library: http://www.va.gov/vdl Navigate to the Clinical Section then
 select the Shift Handoff Tool category.
  
 Install the initial PACKAGE release (CRHD*1)  BEFORE you install this 
 CRHD*1*2 maintenance patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following 4 issues:
      
 1.  When setting up an Ordering Dialog to define a DNR order in CPRS
     Manager Menu Option [ORCM ORDERS], if the text parameter 'WRAP/DON'T
     WRAP' is set to 'DON'T WRAP', the Shift Handoff Tool displays 'Code
     Status Not Found' instead of the DNR order.
      
 2.  Free Text DNR Searches defined in Shift Handoff Tool/Preference
     Configuration/DNR Orders do not always find the defined DNR Free Text.
      
 3.  Free Text DNR Searches defined in Shift Handoff Tool/Preference
     Configuration/DNR Orders do not always find the defined DNR Free Text
     due to being case sensitive.
            
 4.  Correct a display and print issue when encountering patients with
     duplicate names in the H.O.T. List.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 1.  HD0000000279620 unable to print or view information      
        
     Problem:
     --------
     When an ordering dialog is used to define a DNR order (code status),
     if the text parameter 'WRAP/DON'T WRAP' is set to 'DON'T WRAP' for a
     word processing field, Shift Handoff Tool cannot identify the DNR
     order and outputs 'Code Status Not Found' in the Code Status box.
     This problem resulted in Patient Safety Issue PSPO #1112.
         
     Resolution:
     -----------     
     A modification will be made in routine CRHDDNR to examine the entire
     order text while looking to match on the defined Free Text DNR Order.
     By searching the entire order text, Shift Handoff tool will no longer
     have an issue with finding the "DNR order text to search for" defined
     in Preference Configuration regardless of how the WRAP/DON'T WRAP
     parameter is set.
               
  
 2.  HD0000000353133 FREE TEXT DNR Searches
        
     Problem:
     --------
     Free Text DNR Order Text defined in Preference Configuration/DNR Order
     tab is not always found when examining patient orders when displaying
     the Patient Data Screen.
  
     Resolution:
     -----------  
     The resolution for problem #1 will also fix this problem.  By 
     searching the entire order text, Shift Handoff tool will no longer
     have an issue with Free Text DNR Orders.
  
       
 3.  HD0000000353153 Free Text search fails on mixed case
         
     Problem:
     --------
     Free Text DNR Order Text defined in Preference Configuration can be
     entered as either upper or lower case.  Shift Handoff Tool is case
     sensitive when attempting to match on Free Text DNR Orders and this
     causes some Free Text DNR Orders to not match and not display on the
     Patient Data Screen in some instances.  This could cause DNR Orders to
     be missed or overlooked.
        
     Resolution:
     -----------
     A modification will be made in routine CRHDDNR to translate characters
     from the Patent Order and the Free Text DNR Order Text to Uppercase
     for the comparison only in order to make the check non-case sensitive.
      
  
 4.  HD0000000264027 Patients with same name do not both display
        
     Problem:
     --------
     When displaying or printing H.O.T. List patients (H.O.T. List 
     Configuration or normal H.O.T. List display/print), if the user
     encounters patients with duplicate names, the Shift Handoff Tool GUI
     will only display one of the duplicate patients.
       
     Resolution:
     -----------
     Routines CRHD8 and CRHD9 will be modified to better handle duplicate
     patient names by internally changing array subscripting of patient
     data to uniquely identify patients and make them available for display
     and printing.
