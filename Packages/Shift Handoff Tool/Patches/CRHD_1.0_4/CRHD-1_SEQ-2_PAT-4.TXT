 Remedy Overview
 ===============
  
 1. HD0000000309195 List names/titles are not retained
   
    Problem:
    --------  
    When adding users from the hot list configuration, the last provider 
    loses their provider class or sometimes even dropped from the list 
    entirely.  
       
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in the ProviderExit procedure within Delphi
    to make sure the provider class is retained.
       
 2. HD0000000264610 Printout footer is incorrect
  
    Problem:
    --------     
    The footer of the Patient Data Report needs to reflect Clinician
    instead of Physician.
       
    (Current Text)
    Notice to Users    
    Text present on this print-out is a summary intended for use by
    physicians as they come on duty and for quick reference throughout
    their shift.  The patient's health record must be consulted in all
    cases when this summary information is inadequate for patient care.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    The Patient Data Report footer will now reflect the following:
      
    Notice to Users
    Text present on this print-out is a summary intended for use by
    clinicians as they come on duty and for quick reference throughout
    their shift. The patient's health record must be consulted in all cases
    when this summary information is inadequate for patient care.
      
 3. HD0000000287760 We are back to printing 50 pages on rpt for 
                    Shift Hand Off Tool
  
    Problem:
    --------  
    Shift Handoff Tool is printing blank pages (50) when data forces the
    report to overflow.
            
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made In Delphi to reduce the header printing to
    the first page of the report. Demographics, Code Status, Allergies, and
    Medications will now follow the same logic as the temp fields and 
    truncate when the wording has exceeded the maximum print value.
                
 4. HD0000000333816 Contact information not displaying properly
    
    Problem:
    --------
    When Shift Handoff Tool displays clinician data on the Patient Data
    screen, Contact Information, there are multiple clinicians within the
    same Class (i.e multiple medical students) Shift Handoff Tool that do
    not display the clinicians properly.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in the Shift Handoff Tool GUI to display
    the multiple clinicians, delimited with a semi-colon directly across
    from their corresponding label.
    Example:
    Student(s)   student1; student2; student3; etc
      
 5. HD0000000265782 No SENSITIVE patient warning
   
    Problem:
    --------
    When patient selection is performed in Shift Handoff Tool there is
    currently no 'Sensitive Patient' Warning displayed.
      
    Resolution:
    -----------     
    A modification will be made in the Shift Handoff Tool GUI to display
    the 'Sensitive Patient' warning.  The rpc's DG SENSITIVE RECORD ACCESS 
    and DG SENSITIVE RECORD BULLETIN were registered (added) to the CRHD 
    SHIFT CHANGE HANDOFF option. This gives the GUI access to these two
    RPC's.
      
  
       
 SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION DISTRIBUTION
 ======================================= 
 Sites may retrieve the new GUI and documentation directly via FTP. The 
 preferred method is to FTP the files from:
       
        download.vista.med.va.gov
       
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server.  
       
 Sites may also elect to retrieve the documentation directly from the
 ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory from a specific server as follows:
       
 Albany:             ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
 Hines:              ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
 Salt Lake City:     ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
