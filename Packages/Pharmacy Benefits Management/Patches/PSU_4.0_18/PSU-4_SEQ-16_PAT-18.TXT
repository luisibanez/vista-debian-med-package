Subject: DATE LIMIT PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGEMENT MANUAL REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch fixes the following issues:
  
 1) When users run reports from the Manual Pharmacy Statistics option [PSU 
 PBM MANUAL] for a large timeframe, this would cause the XTMP global to
 fill up in some cases and prevent users from logging into CPRS.
  
 2) Controlled substances are showing up as being linked incorrectly to an 
 outpatient clinic.
  
 3) Integrated facilities are not correctly distinguished between in 
 national reports.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000372048 - Restrict Time Range on PSO COSTMONTH
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user run a report from the Manual Pharmacy Statistics option [PSU 
 PBM MANUAL] for a large date range, it is possible for the XTMP global to
 fill up and cause other applications, such as CPRS to not work correctly.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine PSUCP1 has been modified to display a warning message if a report
 from Manual Pharmacy Statistics option [PSU PBM MANUAL] is being run with
 a date range greater than 93 days.
  
 WARNING you have chosen a range greater than 93 days.
 This could potentially create a very large amount of data.
 This may result in system problems.
  
 2) HD0000000276007 - Wrong Division for Order on Procurement Report
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the Pharmacy Benefits Management Procurement report [psu pbm manual],
 controlled substances are showing up as linked to an outpatient clinic
 when they should only be tied to the division.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routine PSUPR2 has been modified to reset the location for each invoice. 
 The location was being incorrectly carried over from the previously 
 processed invoice.
  
  
 3) HD0000000418686 - PBM Extract Lab Data does not identify integrated 
                      facility correctly
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When transmitting lab results to the national server, Pharmacy Benefits 
 Management was not sending the correct station number in the case of 
 integrated sites. The station number was sent by Health Level Seven 
 Optimized (HLO) and not PSU. This would send the 3 digit site number
 instead of the 5 character alpha-numeric value which distinguishes the
 station.
  
 Solution:
 ---------
 Routines PSULRHL1, PSULRHL2 and PSULRHL3 have been modified to send and
 receive the 5 character alpha-numeric station number.
 File 99999 has also been modified to add a new field to contain the 
 station number.
  
 **Note** This file is not a standard national file and is only used and 
 located on the CMOP-NAT server. For the most up to date definition at the 
 time of this release please see the related remedy ticket. 
  
  ***********************Warning*****************************
  *File 99999 should not exist on any server but CMOP-NAT.  *
  *The definition has been preserved for development and    *
  *reference purposes only.                                 *
