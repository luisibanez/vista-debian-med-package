Description:
============

 This patch is being released as part of Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements Fiscal 
 Year 2011 to address the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) 
 Enhancements. The Pharmacy Data Management patch PSS*1*156 is also being 
 released as part of this enhancement.
   
 Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) facilities have moved to using multiple 
 vendors for automated medication dispensing systems to improve the efficiency 
 of outpatient pharmacy operations. The following enhancements were made to the 
 Outpatient Pharmacy software to allow any one division to have more than one 
 Automated Dispensing Device (ADD) communicating with Veterans Health 
 Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) through the OPAI.
   
 1.  A new file named PHARMACY AUTOMATED DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53)
     was created. Entries in this file are required only if the site wants to 
     utilize the multiple dispensing functionality. The new file contains the 
     following fields:
    
     NAME - A free-text field that is between 3-30 characters in length. It 
            is the name given to the automated dispensing device.
     DNS  - A free-text field that is between 1-50 characters in length. It
            stores the DNS name or IP address of the automated dispensing 
            device.
     PORT - This field is a numeric between 1 and 65535 with no decimal places.
            It stores the port associated with the automated dispensing device. 
     INACTIVE 
     DATE - This is a date field, not required, but is used to inactivate 
            the OPAI connection to an automated dispensing device.
  
 2.  A new menu option named Enter/Edit Automated Dispensing Devices [PSO 
     AUTO DISPENSING DEVICE] was created to maintain the PHARMACY AUTOMATED 
     DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53). The option is located under the 
     Maintenance (Outpatient Pharmacy) [PSO MAINTENANCE] menu. Only sites 
     planning to use the multiple automated dispensing devices for an outpatient
     division should use this option.
   
 3.  A new sub-file (#59.20081) multiple named OPAI was added to the 
     DISPENSING SYSTEM PRINTER sub-file (#59.02008) in the OUTPATIENT SITE 
     file (#59). The sub-file contains the following new fields:
   
     DNS NAME      - This field is a pointer to the PHARMACY AUTOMATED 
                     DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53).
     CATEGORY      - Categories provide the flexibility of routing RXs to
                     different ADDs. This field contains the following set of 
                     codes:
                     MCS    MAIL - CS
                     MNCS   MAIL - NCS
                     MAIL   MAIL
                     WCS    WINDOW - CS
                     WNCS   WINDOW - NCS
                     WIND   WINDOW
                     CS     CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
                     NCS    NONCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE
                     A      ANY
                     S      STORAGE
    
 4.  The Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option was modified 
     for addition of the new fields in the OPAI multiple (#59.20081) in the 
     OUTPATIENT SITE file (#59).
   
 5.  During prescription processing, if the label printer selected has ADDs 
     defined then Rx will be routed to the appropriate ADDs. A message will 
     be displayed indicating the ADDs where the Rx will be routed. Below is 
     an example of the routing message.
  
       PRESCRIPTIONS SENT TO:
         OPTIFILL1
           100002815      ACETAMINOPHEN 325MG C.T.
           100002816      AMOXICILLIN 250MG CAP
           100002824      AMOXAPINE 50MG TAB
    
         SCRIPTPRO1
           100002844      CIMETIDINE 200MG TAB
    
 6.  During testing a problem was discovered in the Print from Suspense
     File [PSO PNDLBL] and Reprint Batches from Suspense [PSO PNDRPT] options. 
     The ZTIO variable, which stores the label printer, was being reset to null
     after processing each patient prescription. As a result a printer defined 
     with multiple ADDs was not routing prescriptions properly. Routines 
     PSOSULBL and PSOSUSRP were modified to address this problem.
  
 7.  A new Integration Control Registration (ICR) #5579 was created to grant 
     the Pharmacy Data Management package read access to the PHARMACY 
     AUTOMATED DISPENSING DEVICES file (#52.53).
  
 8.  As per the User Group request, when a dispense complete message is 
     received by VistA from the external dispensing interface and if the 
     mail tracking information is included in the 13th piece of the RXD 
     segment, then the Comment field of the activity log will be updated with 
     this information.
