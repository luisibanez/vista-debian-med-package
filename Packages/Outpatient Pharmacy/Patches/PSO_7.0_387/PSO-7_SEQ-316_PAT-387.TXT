 ****************************** Note **************************************
 This patch is a follow-up patch for Medication Order Check Healthcare 
 Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  The MOCHA v1.0 patches are being released as a 
 phased implementation release.  To see current status and target dates for
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites should have received instructions and guidance on the installation 
 of MOCHA v1.0 as it is a phased implementation. Patches PSO*7*387,
 PSJ*5*263, PSS*1*163 and OR*3*346 need to be installed within 2 business 
 days at all sites that have MOCHA v1.0 installed in production.  The
 remaining sites need to install the patches included with this release
 immediately after the installation of the MOCHA v1.0 patches.  These
 patches may be installed in any order after the MOCHA v1.0 patches are
 installed.   (The MOCHA v1.0 installation included patches PSS*1*136,
 PSO*7*251, PSJ*5*181, OR*3*272, PSS*1*117, PSO*7*375)
  
 **************************************************************************
  
 This patch corrects the following:
  
 1. Technician order issues:
  
    a. For a technician entered order, the message "Remote data not
       available- Only local order checks processed" was rolling off the 
       screen. This message is displayed when remote data isn't
       available just before therapeutic duplications during the
       prescription order process.  This has been corrected by adding an
       "Enter to continue" prompt after the messages displayed when the
       user is a technician.  (CCR 4133)
  
    b. A site reported that non-verified prescriptions are being sent to
       the Outpatient Pharmacy Automated Interface (OPAI). If a 
       prescription is non-verified, the Rx shouldn't go to OPAI regardless
       of whether a label is printed due to a critical interaction.  A
       change was made to prohibit non-verified orders from passing to
       OPAI.  HD0000000502791 (CCR 4467)
  
 2. Prescription Label issues addressed:
  
    a. For the warning label that prints during technician order entry 
       for NEW LABEL STOCK labels, the text in the middle section of the
       label was not wrapping properly.  This was for non-laser labels
       only. A modification was made to properly wrap the text to the next
       line.  (CCR 4093)
    
    b. An issue was reported where partial labels always printed MAIL on 
       the label even when the user selected WINDOW during entry of a
       partial prescription.  The system was using whatever route was
       defined on the original fill.  This issue only applies when the site
       uses a printer not defined as a laser printer and has the outpatient
       site parameter NEW LABEL STOCK set to YES.  A correction was made to
       print partial labels when the user selects WINDOW and to process
       MAIL partial prescriptions appropriately. (CCR 4421)
   
    c. A Meds-by-Mail site reported that the user was prompted to print a 
       drug interaction warning label when a technician entered an order
       that resulted in a significant drug interaction without an
       accompanying critical interaction.  In this case, the site had the
       pharmacy verification parameter set to ON.  The system should not
       prompt for nor print a drug interaction warning label in this
       scenario.  When the Outpatient Pharmacy verification parameter is
       set to ON for both NEW LABEL STOCK and LASER LABELS, a correction
       was made to not prompt technicians to print labels when there is
       only a significant drug interaction.  The functionality that
       automatically places such orders in a non-verified status has not
       changed.  HD0000000498667 (CCR 4434)
  
    d. When the verification site parameter is off and a technician enters
       an order that has a critical interaction, the technician warning
       label does not print for NEW LABEL STOCK labels.   The dispensing
       label does print.  This issue is not present with laser labels.  
       With this patch, the critical interaction warning label will print
       along with the dispensing label for NEW LABEL STOCK labels. (CCR 
       4494)
  
    e. For laser labels when verification is off, a technician entered
       order was printing the dispensing label, but not printing the
       warning label. With this patch, both the warning label and the
       dispensing label will print.  (CCR 4494)
  
    f. The text 'This prescription has caused a DRUG-DRUG INTERACION' has 
       been removed from the first column on the technician warning labels
       for non-laser labels to make them consistent with laser labels. 
       (CCR 4111)
  
  
 3. Undefined Errors found by SQA:
  
    These errors have not been reported by a site.
  
    a. When a page feed occurs just prior to the "Verify for" prompt:
       <UNDEFINED> VERIFY+2^PSOVER1 *DFN.(CCR 4126) 
  
    b. An undefined error occurs when the user is returned to the "Select
       RX with Order Checks:" prompt after verifying an order using the
       PROCESS ORDER CHECKS [PSO ORDER CHECKS VERIFY] option:
       <UNDEFINED>DGDGI+11^PSOVER *DFN.(CCR 4126)
  
    c. Using the Rx Verification by Clerk option, a subscript error occurs
       after an unsuccessful request to First Data Bank (FDB) is received.
       This occurs during the order check process just before the PDM API
       is called: <UNDEFINED> OBX+3^PSODDPRE.
       ^TMP(547819387,"PSOPEPS","OUT",0).  (CCR 4472) 
  
    A modification was made to retain the DFN variable prior to processing 
    enhanced order checks and restoring it afterward to eliminate each of
    the undefined errors. (CCR 4487)
  
 5. Enhanced Order Check modifications:
  
    a. A site reported that Discontinued/Expired OP orders were not being
       screened in CPRS or Inpatient Medication for Drug Interaction Order
       Checking.  With this patch the software will screen out
       Discontinued/Expired outpatient orders for CPRS and Inpatient
       Medications and they will not participate in Order Checks. (CCR
       4448)
  
    b. A correction was made to address an occurrence reported in a test
       account where Order Checks did not occur and no message was
       displayed to the user.  After the message "Now Processing Enhanced
       Order Checks!  Please wait..." is displayed, the system calls a
       Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) Application Program Interface (API)
       that retrieves order check information.  This API returns a value of
       -1 for error of some type occurred, 0 (zero) for order checks
       complete with no issues found, or 1 for interactions found.  
       Outpatient Pharmacy was not checking for -1.  This patch adds the
       check for -1, and displays a message when -1 is returned. (CCR 4086)
  
  
 6. Miscellaneous corrections:
  
    a. This patch updates the following PSO namespace routines with 
       required Integration Agreement comments for the following routines:
       PSODELI, PSOHLNEW, PSOLBL, PSOLLLI, PSOLMAO, PSORXI. (CCR 4129) 
  
    b. A misspelling of the word "Interoperability" was corrected in the
       first line of routine PSOORRD2. (CCR 4128)
  
    c. After installation of MOCHA 1.0, a site reported that the RDD action
       (Fill/Rel Date Display) on the medication profile screen of the
       Patient Prescription Processing option no longer functioned.  This
       action allows the user to toggle between displaying the last filled
       date and the last released date on the medication profile screen.  
       The RDD action was restored to working order.
       HD0000000505651 (CCR 4497)
  
 This patch addresses the following Remedy Ticket(s):
 ----------------------------------------------------
 HD0000000498667
 HD0000000502791 - PSI (PSPO #2061)
 HD0000000505651 
  
  
 Associated PSIs: 
 ----------------
 PSPO #2061
  
  
 Overview of Remedy Ticket(s):
 -----------------------------
 HD0000000498667 - Technician warning label was printing for significant 
 drug interactions.  These type of labels should only print when a 
 critical interaction is present.  Routines PSODGDGP and  PSOLLLI were 
 modified to correct this issue.
  
 HD0000000502791 - PSI (PSPO #2061) Non-verified prescription orders were
 being passed to OPAI.  This patch corrects this issue.
  
 HD0000000505651 - RDD function within the Patient Prescription Processing
 option is not displaying the correct release date.
