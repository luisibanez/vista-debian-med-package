Subject: MOCHA 1.0 ANCILLARY EMERGENCY PATCH

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This emergency patch updates MEDICATION ORDER CHECK HEALTHCARE APPLICATION
 (MOCHA) 1.0 functionality and contains the following modifications:
  
 1.  If a non-verified prescription order had a status of 
 "drug-interaction", the user was not allowed to edit the prescription 
 during the verification process.  This patch corrects this issue.
 (CCR 3743)
  
 2.  During verification of a technician entered order using the patient 
 prescription processing option, the pharmacist is inconsistently returned
 to the order screen or the med profile screen.  The following lists the
 inconsistencies and corrections made by this patch:  (CCR 3755)
  
     a.  When the user ^ (shift 6) to exit, the user was being returned 
         to the med profile.  This patch corrects this by returning the
         user to the order screen.  The exception to this rule is entering
         ^ (shift 6) at the "EDIT:  (Y/N/P): N//" prompt which return the
         user to the med profile screen.
  
     b.  At the "VERIFY FOR patientlast,first? (Y/N/Delete/Quit): Y//" 
         during the verification process, the user was returned to the
         order screen when the user entered N for No or Q for Quit.  This
         patch corrects this issue by returning the user to the medication
         profile screen instead.
  
     c.  After verifying a clerk entered prescription, the user is not
         being returned to the medication profile screen using the Patient
         Prescription Processing option. This patch makes the change to now
         return the user to the medication profile screen.
  
 3.  When an order was discontinued using the Discontinue Prescription(s) 
 [PSO C] option, the message "Rx# xxxxxx wasDiscontinued" was being 
 displayed.  A change was made to add a space between 'was' and 
 'Discontinued' for this message.  This was reported in Remedy ticket
 HD478319. (CCR 4082)
  
 4.  When finishing a pending complex order that had an undefined schedule
 for the drug ordered on one or more dosing sequences, the system was
 displaying the header "Instructions:" multiple times.  All of the 
 medication instructions were displayed correctly but was spaced out 
 with multiple headers.  This patch corrects this issue. 
 Remedy 478319 (CCR 4208)
  
 5.  For simple and complex orders, the user is not returned to the 
 order screen, but is instead returned to the medication profile
 screen upon responding 'NO' to the 'Do you want to continue?' prompt
 that is displayed after all drug interactions are displayed.  This
 occurs during edit of a prescription.  A correction was made to return
 the user back to the order screen.  (CCR 4337)
  
 6.  A site reported an error when trying to verify an order where the  
 drug on the order did not have the NAME field (#.01) defined for VA 
 GENERIC file (#50.6) and the cross reference for this file was damaged.  
 The system expects for the Name field (#.01 ) of VA GENERIC file (#50.6)
 to be defined; however, the system should exit gracefully instead of
 creating a hard error.  This is a very unique incident where the drug at
 the site was corrupted.  A change was made to prevent a hard error in this
 situation.  If the VA Generic Name is not available, the system will use
 the orderable item name or a truncated drug name for sorting the order
 checks to be displayed. The site corrected the VA Generic Name on the
 prescription order and was able to process the medication normally. Remedy
 494769 (CCR 4407)
  
 7.  When printing a drug interaction monograph to a print device, a hard 
 error was received (<ENDOFFILE>SCREEN+6^DIR).  This error did not affect
 print jobs that were queued or where the printer was set up for forced
 queuing.  When printing the monograph, the systems switches between
 foreground processing and background processing which handles the task of
 queuing the monograph to a print device.  The print device must be opened
 prior to the system printing to the device.  In this scenario, the error
 was caused by the print device not being open.  This patch corrects this
 problem by opening the device for non-queued print jobs. 
 Remedy 511943 (CCR 4334)
  
 8. A change was made in Mocha V. 1.0 when receiving an Outpatient order
 from CPRS. If only an Orderable Item comes across with no Dispense Drug,
 but there is only one active Dispense Drug matched to that Orderable Item
 marked for Outpatient "O" in the APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE Field (#63) of
 the DRUG File (#50), then regardless of what other drugs are matched to
 that Orderable Item, the software assigns that drug to the order. For
 Pending orders that would be correct, but for a NON-VA Med order, that
 assignment may not be correct because the package use indicator for a
 NON-VA Med drug is "X" , not "O". This can potentially effect what drug 
 the order checks (drug interaction and duplicate therapy) are done
 against, therefore possibly not returning any valid order checks, when in
 fact there should be order checks displayed to the user if the correct 
 intended drug was used, depending on the set up of the drugs matched to
 the Pharmacy Orderable Item. This patch will remove the functionality of
 assigning a Dispense Drug to any Outpatient order that comes from CPRS
 without a Dispense Drug, upon file entry. (CCR 4522)
  
 9. When drug interaction and duplicate therapy checks are done against a 
 Non-VA Med order that only has a Pharmacy Orderable Item without any 
 Dispense Drugs, logic is executed to find the best drug matched to the
 Pharmacy Orderable Item to perform the order check. The current logic
 gives preference to drugs marked for Outpatient "O" in the APPLICATION
 PACKAGES' USE Field (#63) of the DRUG File (#50) over drugs marked for
 NON-VA Meds "X". This patch makes the change to give preference to drugs
 marked for NON-VA Meds "X". Additionally, order checks (drug interaction
 and duplicate therapy) may not even occur when they should, if there are
 no drugs marked for Outpatient "O", since in this case preference should
 be given to drugs marked for NON-VA Meds "X". (CCR 4537 and CCR 3845)
  
 10.  When a medication order is entered through CPRS and there is an 
 Outpatient Pharmacy Pending order on the profile that has a dispense drug
 assigned to it, a duplicate drug check will not occur in CPRS if that same
 drug is the drug being entered. That patch fixes the problem so the
 duplicate drug check will now display in CPRS.  (CCR 4583)
  
 11.  A site reported that when a Pharmacist and Tech were placing an
 order, the text "RX DELETED" was displayed on the screen.  This was
 happening sporadically.  This issue was caused by the POERR variable not 
 being cleaned up after order check processing was completed.  To correct
 this problem, the POERR variable has been 'newed' in the PSONEW routine.  
 Remedy 505644 (CCR 4568) 
  
 12.  A site reported that they received a MAXSTRING hard error when 
 printing from suspense for local mail.  The MAXSTRING error was caused
 by the variable LINE becoming too large for the system to handle.  The
 site was able to print from suspense a second time to generate the rest 
 of the labels.  This issue occurred with non-laser labels.  This patch
 corrects this issue by deleting the LINE variable upon exiting label
 print. Remedy 511486 (CCR 4581) 
  
 13.  Currently when order checks take place, if there is a Non-VA Med 
 order on the Patient Profile with no Dispense Drug in the order, and all
 DRUG File (#50) entries matched to the Pharmacy Orderable Item are marked
 as Supply Items, an error message will be displayed for that Non-VA Med
 order with this reason:
  
 Reason: No active Dispense Drug found.
  
 This patch fixes the problem by first checking all drugs matched to the 
 Pharmacy Orderable Item, and if there are no active Drugs matched to the 
 Pharmacy Orderable Item that are not marked as a Supply, and every active 
 drug matched to the Pharmacy Orderable Item marked for Non-VA Med Use in 
 the APPLICATION PACKAGES' USE Field (#63) in the DRUG File (#50) is marked
 as a Supply, then this message will not display. Remedy 514738, 512417, 
 513402 (CCR 4678)
  
 14.  Sites reported that Outpatient orders are sporadically locking and 
 pharmacist cannot fill the order.  The Pharmacy Re-engineering work 
 group decided that drugs on the med profile that the drug being
 worked on had a drug interaction with will no longer be locked.  The drug 
 being worked on will continue to be locked. Remedy 512743, 355584, 319666 
 PSPO 1391, 304596 (CCR 4675)
  
 15.  When reinstating an order, the prescription information rolls off 
 the screen.  This patch adds an "Enter to continue" prompt to eliminate 
 this problem.  (CCR 4712)
  
 16.  Discontinued OP orders (outside the formula:  cancel date + days 
 supply +7) are still being included in duplicate therapy order checks as 
 reported by two sites. This patch screens out discontinued 
 prescriptions that exceed the formula.  Remedy 515643 (CCR 4700)
  
 17.  Sites reported that some of their technician entered orders were not 
 displaying under Rx Verify by Clerk or the List Non-Verified Scripts 
 options.  When a non-verified prescription did not have a drug
 interaction, the system was not storing it in RX VERIFY file (#52.4).  
 With this patch, the system will store non-verified orders with and 
 without drug interactions.  Remedy 515009, 516416 (CCR 4686)
  
 18.  Sites not using laser labels reported that reprints of multiple
 non-laser labels for a ScripTalk patient causes MAXSTRING  hard error and
 a runaway job that printed numerous labels. Both of these issues are 
 corrected with this patch.  Remedy 515573, 515603, 515927, 515020 (CCR
 4687)
  
 19.  When verification is set to off, technician orders that did not have 
 a drug interaction were being shown on the List Non-Verified Scripts 
 option.  A modification was made to prevent this type of order from 
 erroneously be defined in the RX VERIFY file (#52.4). (CCR 4952)
  
 20.  A site reported that they were receiving two "Press return to
 continue" prompts when placing an order that had multiple duplicate
 drugs.  Changes were made to eliminate the duplicate prompt. (CCR 4826)
  
 21.  If the Clinical Effects section is lengthy, it rolls off the top of
 the screen of the drug interaction display.  A modification was made to
 page break during the display of the clinical affects section when
 necessary. (CCR 4958)
  
 22.  An order check message was being displayed erroneously in 
 Inpatient Medication for discontinued prescriptions with a cancel date
 outside the calculated range (Cancel date + Days Supply +7 days).
 This message should not display. Remedy 590930 (CCR 4977)
  
 23.  A site reported an issue where sporadically a pending order was not 
 being discontinued when a duplicate drug was ordered.  Also, the message 
 following the prompt shown below was not displayed when the user selected
 to discontinue the pending order:
  
    Discontinue Pending Order for SIMVASTATIN 80MG TAB Y/N? YES
  
    Pending Order for SIMVASTATIN 80MG TAB will be discontinued after the
    acceptance of the new order.  
  
 Changes were made to appropriately discontinue the order and display the 
 correct messaging.  (CCR 5062)
  
 24.  A site reported an issue where they received a hard error when they 
 placed two orders. The first order was entered but the user exited when 
 drug interactions were displayed.  A second order was immediately placed 
 for a drug that only received dosing checks. The system gave a hard
 error after acceptance of the second order. To prevent this error, a 
 change was made to clean up left over variables and to verify that order 
 checks are present before displaying the drug interaction dialog. (CCR 
 5069)
