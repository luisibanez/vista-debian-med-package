Subject: DATE OF DEATH/RETURN TO STOCK AND LAST FILL DATE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issues:
  
 1) When the Date of Death is deleted from a patient, a mailman message is 
 generated that contains the patient's full name and last four digits of 
 their Social Security Number in the subject line.  This is a patient 
 privacy issue.
  
 2) Return to Stock for the original fill and partials do not trigger a 
 Vista Data Extract Framework (VDEF) call to update the Health Data
 Repository (HDR).
  
 3) When a prescription is auto-DC'ed, if the pharmacist reinstates the 
 prescription, the Last Fill Date gets set to today's date rather than 
 reverting back to the actual Last Fill Date.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000093395     Date of Death Security Issue
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 When the Date of Death is deleted from a patient and the patient has 
 discontinued prescriptions, pending orders or non-VA meds from when the 
 date of death was entered, a mailman message is sent to all users who 
 have the PSORPH key.  This message contains the patient's full name and 
 last four digits of their Social Security Number in the subject line.  
 This is a patient privacy issue.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 This issue will be resolved by removing the patient name and SSN 
 information from the subject line of the mailman message.  
  
 A new mail group "PSO DEATH GROUP" will be created to send the message 
 to.  If there are no users entered into the new mail group the message 
 will then go to holders of the PSORPH key
 just as it does now.
  
 All users who hold the PSORPH key will continue to receive the mail 
 message even if they are not in the,  "PSO DEATH GROUP".  
  
 During patch installation, the installer will be prompted to enter the 
 coordinator for the new Mail Group "PSO DEATH GROUP".
  
 This is a Patient Privacy issue.
  
  
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOAUTOC.
  
  
  
 2) HD0000000321470     Return to Stock VDEF Trigger
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Return to Stock for the original fill and partials do not trigger a Vista
 Data Extract Framework (VDEF) call to update the Health Data Repository (HDR).
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Need to modify processing so when an original fill or partial is returned
 to stock a VDEF trigger occurs.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 =====================
 Modify routine PSORESK.
  
  
 3)HD0000000200801       Last Fill Date
                           
                           
 Problem:
 ========
 When a prescription is auto-DC'ed, if the pharmacist reinstates the 
 prescription, the Last Fill Date gets set to today's date rather than 
 reverting back to the actual Last Fill Date.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The Auto Cancel routine is not setting the Last Dispensed Date Holder
 field (#127) in the Prescription file (#52). A change has been made to the
 routine PSOAUTOC to set node 7 in the Prescription file (#52) so that the
 correct date is populated in the Last Dispensed Date field.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOAUTOC.
