 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000712917 - Incorrect data displays in Vista option "VIEW PRESCRIPTION"
 [PSO VIEW]
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The option VIEW PRESCRIPTIONS [PSO VIEW] utilizes List Manager to display
 information for the prescription entered by the user. This utility uses a
 message box to display customized text to the screen. The text is set into
 the variable VALMSG. 
  
 After processing telephone refills, and using the caret to jump to the VIEW
 PRESCRIPTIONS [PSO VIEW] option, the message box displays information for
 a prescription that was processed for telephone refills. The text
 displayed is not for the prescription entered by the user for review.
  
  
 Technical Explanation
 ---------------------
 If a telephone refill is placed into suspense, the suspense functionality
 sets VALMSG with text stating that the prescription has been placed into
 suspense. The variable remains set after processing, and contains suspense
 text for the last prescription processed.
  
 The user jumps to VIEW PRESCRIPTIONS [PSO VIEW], to review information on
 prescriptions that may or may not be telephone refills.  Because the
 VALMSG variable is still set, the text in the message box is not for the
 prescription displayed on the screen.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify routine PSORXL1 so that the stray variable, VALMSG is deleted if
 the prescription being processed is a telephone refill.
