 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. HD0000000284472 - Poly Pharmacy Report carrying over a variable 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The same last 4 digits of the SSN prints for every patient with Non-VA meds
 and no prescriptions on the Poly Pharmacy Report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the report so as each patient is processed, the correct last 4 digits 
 of their SSN prints correctly.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOPOLY to call KVA^VADPT then PID^VADPT for each patient with 
 non-VA meds and no prescriptions.
  
  
 2. HD0000000616602 - <UNDEFINED>BEG+4^PSOPOLY
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An Undefined error occurs when running the Poly Pharmacy Report for one 
 patient that only has Non-VA Meds and no Prescriptions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the report so it can be run for one patient with only Non-VA Meds and 
 no prescriptions without erroring out.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOPOLY to define variable P prior to looping down the 
 patient's prescriptions and Non-VA meds at BEG+4^PSOPOLY.
  
 3. HD0000000474930 - Display of CMOP Suspense Date truncated on reinstate on
                   Medication Profile Screen
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The display for the CMOP suspense date is being truncated on the Medication
 Profile Screen due to the length restrictions.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Shorten the message by removing the words "HAS BEEN" from the display.  
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOCMOP to shorten the display message.  This was approved
 by the PLE on April 4, 2011 via e-mail.
