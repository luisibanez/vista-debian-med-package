Subject: <FILEFULL> ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 When processing Pending Orders, the system evaluates each word of
 the Provider Comments and if any word is longer than 60 characters
 and has one of the special delimiters (; , = :) after character 57
 (in character position 58 or greater), it gets carried over to the
 next line which will again follow this same pattern and the loop
 begins which causes the <FILEFULL> error.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000622353 - Prescription for patient is shutting down the system
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When processing Pending Orders in Outpatient Pharmacy, the system hangs
 if any word in the Provider Comments is longer than 60 characters and
 has a special delimiter (;,=:) after character position 57. If this 
 process continues to run, a <FILEFULL> error will occur.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify processing so if any word is at least 61 characters long and has
 a special delimiter (;,:=) at character 58 or later, split the line the
 same as if it does not have a special delimiter.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOUTLA2 at tag WORDWRAP + 61, if word is at least 61
 characters long and has a special delimiter (;,:=) at character 58
 or later, split the line the same as if it does not have a special
 delimiter.
