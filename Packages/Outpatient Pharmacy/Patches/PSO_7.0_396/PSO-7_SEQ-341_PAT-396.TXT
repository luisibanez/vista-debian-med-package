Subject: INCORRECT LAST FILL DATE RESTORED/PRINT ISSUES WITH TRICARE PRESCRIPTIONS 

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues: 
  
 1. The last fill date for the prescription was not restored to the correct
    date after the "date of death" status was reversed.
  
 2. When reinstating a TRICARE prescription from the Discontinue
    Prescription(s) [PSO C] option, labels were not printing for a
    rejected TRICARE claim if the users ignored the reject via the reject
    notification screen.  
  
 3. Ensure that users understand how to set Pharmacy parameters so that CPRS
    refills can process automatically.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000498138 - Date of Death cancelled prescriptions reinstated do not
    show correct Last Fill dates. (PSPO#2049)
  
  
 Patient Safety Issue:
 ===================== 
 PSPO#2049 
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The "last fill date" for the prescription was being set to the date users
 entered a "date of death" for a patient.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modify routine PSOCAN2 so that the "last fill date" does not get reset to
 when "date of death" was entered.
  
  
 2. HD0000000601013 - Print issues with TRICARE prescriptions
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When reinstating a TRICARE prescription from the Discontinue Prescription(s)
 option [PSO C], users are not getting the appropriate label prompts and
 messages if the rejected TRICARE claim was ignored via the TRICARE reject
 notification screen.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If a rejected TRICARE claim is ignored via the TRICARE reject notification
 screen and the fill date is in the past, users will be asked whether they
 want to print a label.  In the same scenario except if the fill date is
 equal to the current date, the user will get a message to use the reprint
 option to print a label.  
  
  
 3. HD0000000586028 - Refills are clogging CPRS
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Not all VAMC(s) are aware of how to get CPRS refills to process automatically.
 In order to implement this functionality, a site must do the following:
  
 a. Set the AUTOMATE CPRS REFILL flag to "YES".
 b. Give the PSOAUTRF security key to at least one user.
  
 The data dictionary description for the flag in the AUTOMATE CPRS REFILL 
 field (40.16) of the PHARMACY SYSTEM file (#59.7) is missing important 
 information. It should also state that at least one user must have the 
 PSOAUTRF security key to ensure that CPRS refills process automatically. 
 Having just the flag set to "YES" is not enough.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Updated the data dictionary description for the AUTOMATE CPRS REFILL flag.
 The description now states that if the site wants CPRS refills to process
 automatically, the flag must be set to "YES", and at least one user must
 have the PSOAUTRF security key. The required security key was not previously
 part of the data dictionary description.  It is now.

                                 '0' FOR NO; 
                                 '1' FOR YES; 
               LAST EDITED:      FEB 13, 2012 
               HELP-PROMPT:      Enter Y to process CPRS refill automatically or 
                                 N to process it manually. 
               DESCRIPTION:      Answer YES if refill requests from CPRS are to
                                 be processed automatically and filed in the
                                 PRESCRIPTION file (#52) and placed on Suspense. 
                                                                                 
                                 Answer NO if refill requests from CPRS are to
                                 be filed in the PENDING OUTPATIENT ORDERS file
                                 (#52.41) for manual processing.  
                                                                                 
                                 NOTE: This functionality is partnered with the
                                 PSOAUTRF security key.  When this field is set
                                 to YES and the PSOAUTRF security key has been
                                 assigned to at least one user, all refills
                                 placed in CPRS by the provider are processed
                                 and suspended with the next fill date and all
                                 routing is set to Mail automatically.  
                                                                                 
                                 When this field is set to NO or if the PSOAUTRF
                                 security key is not assigned, the manual refill
                                 process is required.
