Description:
============

 This patch contains software modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP)
 V. 7.0 application to support the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
 Medication Guides - Increment 3 project. The project objective is to allow
 pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication Guide for prescription items
 that contain FDA approved information that can help patients avoid adverse
 events. The FDA requires that Medication Guides be included with certain
 prescribed drugs and biological products when the Agency determines that:
  
  . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
  . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
    serious side effect with a product, or 
  . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
    to its effectiveness. 
  
 The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
 incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 3 release, which
 is the last planned release. The features included in this release are:
  
  . Ability to create and maintain a list of FDA Medication Guide printers
    for a specific pharmacy division.
  
  . Automatic printing of the FDA Medication Guide along with prescription
    labels on designated FDA Medication Guide printers without any direct
    user interaction. 
  
  . Ability to enable or disable the automatic printing of the FDA
    Medication Guide by pharmacy division.
  
  . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide when reprinting a 
    prescription label.
  
  . Ability to change the FDA Medication Guide printer at any point of the
    dispensing process, similar to changing the label printer.
  
  . Ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide for any given prescription
    fill or the latest FDA Mediation Guide available for the medication on
    the prescription.
   
  . Display on the prescription label that an FDA Medication Guide is
    available, and if printed, needs to accompany the documentation before
    being given to the patient.
  
  . Changes to the prescription label activity logs showing which specific
    FDA Medication Guide document printed along with the label.
  
  . Changes to the Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) Event log
    showing which specific FDA Medication Guide document was available 
    for the medication when the prescription fill was transmitted to CMOP.
  
  . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
    automatic printing of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
    software does not require any direct user interaction. The software 
    identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide
    and automatically sends it to the FDA Medication Guide printer
    selected by the user within VistA when dispensing the medication.
  
  . Ability to update the Windows network printer name for a specific
    device through the Kernel application. Once the pharmacist selects a
    printer to print the FDA Medication Guide Vista will retrieve the 
    Windows name for the printer and will pass it on to the Java
    application responsible for printing the document.
     
    ************************** WARNING **********************************
    *********************************************************************
    If your facility has the Parata or Kirby Lester interface from ILC,
    this patch will overwrite any "local" modifications in routines PSOB,    
    PSOLBL, PSOLLL1, PSOLSET, PSORXL and PSOSULB1. This could affect 
    certain orders being sent across this interface. The modifications
    will have to be reintroduced following installation of this patch.

 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
 with their patch number:
   
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                    PATCH
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0    PSX*2*70
    NATIONAL DRUG FILE (NDF) V. 4.0                        PSN*4*264
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                        PSO*7*367
    KERNEL V. 8.0                                          XU*8*566
    
 The following modifications are included in this patch (PSO*7*367):
  
 1. Site Parameter Enter/Edit [PSO SITE PARAMETERS] option
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Two new parameters are being introduced in this option: 
    a) FDA MED GUIDE PRINT SERVER URL: this field is used to store the
       Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Print Server where the Java
       application responsible for automatically printing of the FDA
       Medication Guides for the division was installed 
       (e.g.,'http://10.4.21.22/'). This field is required for the FDA
       Medication Guide functionality to work properly.
  
    b) FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER: This is a multiple field used to store a
       list of printers used for printing FDA Medication Guide document 
       for the division. There are two fields in the multiple: 1) FDA
       MED GUIDE PRINTER, which is a pointer to the DEVICE file (#3.5).
       Only devices with a content in the WINDOWS NETWORK PRINTER NAME
       field (#75) are selectable, and 2) DEFAULT PRINTER, which 
       indicates whether the printer selected is to be used as the 
       default printer for the division. Only one printer can be set as
       default printer for each division. This field is not required.
       The printers in this multiple will be displayed for selection
       when the user logs into a division. If there is a printer set as
       the default printer, it will be set as the default printer.
    
   
 2. Outpatient Pharmacy Manager [PSO MANAGER] option
    ------------------------------------------------
    When logging into a division, after selecting the Profile and Label
    printers, the user will be prompt to select an FDA Medication Guide
    printer for the current session. If the division selected has a list
    of FDA Medication Guide printers they will be displayed (see below),
    however the user will be able to select other printers as well. The
    HOME and NULL DEVICE are selectable at this point.
  
    Select OPTION NAME: PSO MANAGER       Outpatient Pharmacy Manager
    Outpatient Pharmacy software - Version 
  
    Division:    DIVISION 999 
  
           You are logged on under the DIVISION division.
  
    Select PROFILE PRINTER: HOME//   GENERIC INCOMING TELNET
  
    Select LABEL PRINTER: HOME//   GENERIC INCOMING TELNET
  
    OK to assume label alignment is correct? YES// 
  
    DIVISIONS's FDA Medication Guide Printer(s) on file:
  
      FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER (Default)
  
    Select FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER: FDA MED GUIDE PRINTER//
   
 3. Complete Orders from [OERR PSO LMOE FINISH] option
    Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    There are a few enhancements being added to the prescription processing
    options regarding the printing of FDA Medication Guides. Among them:
   
    a) The FDA Medication Guide document will print automatically for
       prescriptions, if there is one available, and the functionality is     
       enabled.
  
    b) Users will have the ability to change the FDA Medication Guide 
       printer in the same way they change the label and profile printers
       today.
  
    c) When queuing labels to print, if there is at least one prescription
       with an FDA Medication Guide associated, it will require a valid FDA
       Medication Guide printer to be entered. This is similar to requiring
       a valid printer for the label printer.
  
    d) The actual label document will contain a note under the barcode,
       before the PMI document, that says "Read FDA MED Guide". Such note
       should indicate to the pharmacist that an FDA Medication Guide
       document is available, and if printed, should be included with the  
       documentation handed to the patient.
  
    e) The Label Log and CMOP Event Log will both list the FDA Medication
       Guide document name (.pdf) associated with each fill.
    
    f) Users will have the ability to reprint the FDA Medication Guide for
       past prescription fills or the latest FDA Medication Guide available
       for the prescription via a new action RM - Reprint FDA Medication
       Guide under the OTH - Other OP Actions menu.
        
 4. Print from Suspense File [PSO PNDLBL] option
    --------------------------------------------
    In order to run this option users will be required to enter a valid FDA
    Medication Guide printer. All prescriptions that prints a label via
    this option and that have an FDA Medication Guide associated will have
    the document printed as well on the designated printer.
  
 5. Pull Early from Suspense [PSO PNDRX] option
    -------------------------------------------
    If the prescription being pulled from suspense has an FDA Medication
    Guide associated the user will be required to enter a valid FDA
    Medication Guide printer to where the document will be printed for
    the prescription.
  
 6. Change Label Printer [PSO CHANGE PRINTER] option
    ------------------------------------------------
    This option is used by users to change the profile and label printers
    after having logged on to a pharmacy division. It is being modified to
    allow users to change the FDA Medication Guide printer as well.
    
 7. Reprint an Outpatient Rx Label [PSO RXRPT] option
    -------------------------------------------------
    If the prescription selected to reprinted the label has an FDA 
    Medication Guide associated, this option will ask whether the user also
    wants to reprint the FDA Medication Guide. If they answer YES, a valid
    FDA Medication Guide printer will be required for the user to proceed
    with the reprinting of the label and FDA Medication Guide.
  
 8. Label/Profile Monitor Reprint [PSO B] option
    Reprint External Batches [PSO INTERFACE REPRINT] option
    Reprint Batches from Suspense [PSO PNDRPT] option
    -------------------------------------------------------
    These options are used for reprinting batches of labels that may have 
    jammed on the printer. When reprinting labels via one of these options
    users will be prompted if they also want to reprint the FDA Medication
    Guide. If they answer YES, a valid FDA Medication Guide printer will be
    required for the user to proceed with the reprinting of the label and
    FDA Medication Guide, if one is available.
  
 9. The background process that calculates suspense days now rounds any
    partial day to the next full day. This modification was moved from 
    patch PSO*7*385 into this patch due to routine overlap and to avoid
    patch dependency.
