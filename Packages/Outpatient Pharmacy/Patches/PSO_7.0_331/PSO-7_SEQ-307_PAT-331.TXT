 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000237146     Missing RX
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 If a prescription has a Released Date but not time, the prescription 
 will not show up on the High Cost Rx Report [PSO HI COST]. 
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Need to modify the High Cost Rx Report [PSO HI COST] to include
 prescriptions that do not have a time for the Released Date.Time.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOCST10 at START+1 so variable PSDT=NDT-1_".999999" 
 instead of PSDT=NDT.
  
  
 2) HD0000000306395     P&T wants "Hold" orders to remain viewable at the
                        system level overriding any personal settings.
                        Is that possible?
 Problem: 
 ========
 When selecting the 'Sort by Drug (alphabetically), status active, status
 recent expired' view on the Meds tab, prescriptions that have the status
 of Hold or Provider Hold are not displayed.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modify the Meds tab in CPRS so prescriptions that are on Hold or Provider
 Hold will be displayed when choosing the 'Sort by Drug (alphabetically),
 status active, status recent expired' view.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routine PSOORRL3 at tag OCL+8 to include the statuses of 3 (Hold)
 and 16 (Provider Hold).

 Patient Safety Issue - PSPO1159
  
 Problem:  
 ========
 In CPRS Active Non-VA meds, if they have a start date older than the
 ORCH CONTEXT MEDS date are not displayed.  Active meds should always
 display. 
  
 While testing it was also found that Discontinued Non-VA meds that have a
 null start date will also never be removed.
  
  
 Solution:  
 =========
 Need to modify the three views (Sort by Status/Exp. Date (IMO first on
 Inpt), Sort by Status Group/Status/Location/Drug Name, Sort by Drug 
 (alphabetically), status Active, status recent expire) so the Non-VA
 medications that were active within the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS date range
 are displayed.
  
 Technical Solution:
 -------------------
 Modify routines PSOORRLO, PSOORRLN, PSOORRL3 in tag NVA to check which
 meds were active during the ORCH CONTEXT MEDS date range and only display
 those.
