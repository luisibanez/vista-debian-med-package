 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000100772 - *Default summary 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An undefined error occurred when Print From Suspense was selected.  An
 error occurred in a routine that is called as part of the OPAI HL7 message
 generation build process, to create the other language SIG component.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change calling routine (PSOSPSIG), to use a $G around the XDOSE array 
 that is returned by the PDM API, PSSORPH.  The $G will prevent the 
 Undefined error reported.
  
  
 2) HD0000000540633 - label missing noun in sig
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After fixing an Undefined error when printing from suspense (Issue 1), it was
 noticed that the noun was missing from the sig on the label.  This issue 
 occurs when the label is printed for a prescription where the patient has 
 another language preference, the drug for the prescription is inactive and 
 the prescription was placed on suspense.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This will be resolved by including the noun in the sig when printing a label
 using Print from Suspense.
