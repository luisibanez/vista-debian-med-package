 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000422590 - Incorrect Pharmacist is appearing on prescriptions
   
    Problem: 
    ========
    When releasing a controlled substance the incorrect Pharmacist is
    appearing on the prescriptions.  When an original controlled substance
    prescription is released the pharmacists ID is sent through the input
    transform prior to storing it in the PRESCRIPTION file (#52).  It was
    discovered that if the pharmacists ID matches another field, such as
    SSN, in someone else's NEW PERSON file (#200) it will pull that persons
    ID and attach it to the prescription instead.
  
    Resolution:
    ===========
    Modify routine PSOCSRL for the release of an original controlled
    substance so that the correct pharmacist ID gets attached to the
    prescription.  
  
  
 Technical Resolution:
 =====================
  
 Modify routine ORI+15^PSOCSRL:  Modify the code to change from a three 
 slash stuff, which runs the pharmacists ID through the input transform,
 to a four slash stuff, which will take the pharmacists ID and store it 
 without going through the input transform.
