Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                   PATCH
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                       PSO*7*385
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                        IB*2*452
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0     BPS*1*11
    CONSOLIDATED MAIL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (CMOP) V. 2.0   PSX*2*73
  
 The patches (PSO*7*385, IB*2*452, BPS*1*11, and PSX*2*73) are being released 
 in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) multi-build 
 distribution BPS PSO IB PSX BUNDLE 7.0.
  
 The purpose of this software package is to maintain compliance with 
 legislative and federal mandates and to address and correct gaps and 
 inefficiencies in the current electronic pharmacy billing processes.  This 
 will ultimately increase revenues collected by VA Medical Centers and 
 outpatient pharmacies by reducing the volume of short pays and payment 
 denials.
  
 All pharmacy claims for payers that are processed electronically are 
 compliant with the current industry standards.  This software adds support 
 for the electronic billing of the Health Administration Center (HAC) CHAMPVA 
 payer in order to provide an automated process and to prevent manual 
 workarounds for CHAMPVA.
  
  
 This specific patch contains the following functionality:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
  1. Renamed the PSO TRICARE security keys: PSO TRICARE to PSO 
     TRICARE/CHAMPVA and PSO TRICARE MGR to PSO TRICARE/CHAMPVA MGR. The
     functionality requiring these keys have been adjusted to look for
     these new names.
  
  2. The ability to process CHAMPVA prescriptions through the VistA
     Outpatient Pharmacy software for CHAMPVA eligible inpatients by 
     bypassing ePharmacy claims generation has been added.  For these 
     prescriptions, an entry in the ECME Log section of the View 
     Prescription log will be created with the new non-billable reason 
     of "CHAMPVA INPATIENT/DISCHARGE".
  
  3. An Override function has been added to allow continued processing of
     prescriptions for CHAMPVA eligible outpatients when a rejected
     response is received from the CHAMPVA payer/Pharmacy Benefits Manager
     (PBM).
     
  4. An Override function has been added to allow continued processing of
     prescriptions for CHAMPVA eligible outpatients when a prescription is
     not ECME billable.
  
  5. The PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG file (#52.87) has been renamed to PSO AUDIT
     LOG in order to accommodate CHAMPVA audit data as well as TRICARE.  A 
     new ELIGIBILITY field has been added.
  
  6. Renamed the TRICARE Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRICARE OVERRIDE
     REPORT] option to TRICARE CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRI CVA
     OVERRIDE REPORT].  The TRICARE CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRI
     CVA OVERRIDE REPORT] option was modified to:
       a. Display a new filter prompt for eligibility (CHAMPVA, TRICARE,
          or ALL).
       b. Add 'PARTIAL FILL' to the list of selectable report types.
       c. Depending on user input, add CHAMPVA and/or PARTIAL FILLS to the
          output of the report.
  
  7. Local mail and CMOP suspense processing have been modified to:
       a. Put rejected CHAMPVA prescriptions Suspense to the Third Party
          Payer Rejects screen.
       b. Allow processing of CHAMPVA inpatient prescriptions.
       c. Allow processing of CHAMPVA prescriptions if they have been
          'Ignored' by prior processing.
  
  8. The Third Party Payer Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and
     Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS]
     options have the following changes:
       a. There is a separate section for CHAMPVA Non DUR/RTS
          prescriptions.  There is also a new hidden action CVA (Show/Hide
          CHAMPVA) that toggles whether this section of the screen is
          displayed.
       b. The Reject Information screen was modified to display the Banking
          Identification Number (BIN) instead of the Group Name of the 
          Insurance Plan.
       c. A new hidden action called SDC (Suspense Date Calculation) has 
          been created which calculates a new suspense date based on the 
          Last Date of Service and Last Days Supply retrieved from the 
          most recent ePharmacy claim.  These two inputs and the final 
          suspense date are editable by the user.
       d. A new hidden action called SMA (Submit Multiple Actions) was
          created, which allows a user to enter override values for the 
          Submission Clarification Codes, the Prior Authorization values, 
          and the DUR fields.
       e. For the OVR (Submit Override Codes) action, the data for the
          Reason for Service prompt is now always editable.  Previously,
          it was only editable if there was no default value.
       f. Under certain circumstances, the maximum amount of Payer Addl Msg
          data was not always being displayed.  This has been corrected.
       g. For a TRICARE and CHAMPVA non-billable prescription, the reason 
          not billable returned by IB Billing Determination is displayed
          in the Payer Addl Msg field.
       h. The list of submission clarification codes that can be selected
          in the Submit Clarif. Code [CLA] action has been updated to 
          reflect new values in the NCPDP standard.
  
  9. For a TRICARE or CHAMPVA prescription that is not ECME billable, the
     Medication Profile has been modified to:
      a. Allow the use of the action DC (Discontinue Rx) without reversing
         a claim.  
      b. When using the DC (Discontinue RX) action, the  default for the
         Nature of Order prompt has been changed from SERVICE CORRECTION to
         REJECTED BY SERVICE.
      c. Allow the PR (Partial) for non-billable CHAMPVA/TRICARE
         prescriptions by allowing the user to override the non-billable 
         condition.
  
 10. The ePharmacy Date of Service calculation algorithm has been modified 
     with this patch.  The fill date is no longer considered an acceptable
     value for the date of service.  The algorithm uses the release date if
     it exists.  If the release date doesn't exist, then the system uses
     the current date.
  
 11. ePharmacy replaces the TRICARE and TRI reference with a CHAMPVA and
     CVA reference when referring to a CHAMPVA prescription.
  
 12. A new report now exists called "View ePharmacy Rx" that allows the
     user to view information for one prescription, combining information
     from Outpatient Pharmacy, Integrated Billing and ECME.  This report
     will be available in many places within Outpatient Pharmacy.
  
 13. For ECME billable prescriptions, an alert of "ePharmacy Rx - Obtain
     signature" will be displayed at the time of a window prescription
     release.
  
 14. For ECME billable prescriptions, Outpatient Pharmacy sends an 
     indicator to the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation Interface (OPAI) 
     indicating that the prescription was submitted electronically 
     through ECME.
  
 15. The printer label prompt will no longer be presented to users for
     ePharmacy rejected TRICARE or ePharmacy rejected CHAMPVA 
     prescription.
  
 16. When a TRICARE or CHAMPVA prescription is missing an NDC, it will
     get the TRICARE/CHAMPVA Non-Billable Notification Screen so that
     they can be processed like other TRICARE/CHAMPVA non-billable
     prescription.
     
 17. The Discontinue Prescription(s) [PSO C] option was modified to 
     allow a label to print for a non-billable TRICARE or CHAMPVA 
     prescription that is re-instated and ignored from the TRICARE/CHAMPVA 
     Non-Billable notification screen.
  
 18. Corrected an issue where labels were printing for rejected TRICARE or
     CHAMPVA prescriptions when editing a prescription field that did not 
     result in the generation of a new NCPDP claim.

 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 There is a post-install routine associated with this patch named PSO7P385.
 The purpose of the post install routine is as follows:
  
  1. Populate the ELIGIBILITY field (#18) of the PSO AUDIT LOG file 
     (#52.87). This functionality loops through each entry in the PSO AUDIT
     LOG file.  Depending on the size of this file, some time should be
     allocated for this process to complete.
  
  2. Rename the PSO TRICARE security keys: PSO TRICARE to PSO
     TRICARE/CHAMPVA and PSO TRICARE MGR to PSO TRICARE/CHAMPVA MGR.
  
  3. Remove cached hidden menu pointers allowing modified protocols to
     display correctly.
  
  4. Update the BIN number on the PRESCRIPTION reject multiple. This
     functionality loops through the REJDAT index on the PRESCRIPTION file
     (#52). Depending on the size of this index, some time should be
     allocated for this process to complete.
  
  5. Rename the TRICARE Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRICARE OVERRIDE
     REPORT] option to TRICARE CHAMPVA Bypass/Override Report [PSO TRI CVA
     OVERRIDE REPORT].
  
 The post-install routine is automatically deleted by the system if allowed by
 your Kernel site parameters configuration.  You may delete routine 
 PSO7P385 if the installation was successful and it is not automatically 
 deleted by KIDS.
  
  
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch should take up to 20 minutes to install.
  
 DO NOT QUEUE the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. Scheduled CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
               ***** IMPORTANT INSTALLATION NOTES *****
  
 This patch bundle is changing the name of File #52.87.  The current name of
 this file is 'PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG'.  The new name of this file is 'PSO AUDIT
 LOG'.  During the patch installation you will see the following information
 presented to the screen:
  
       52.87     PSO AUDIT LOG
    *BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE 'PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG' AS FILE #52.87!
    Shall I write over your PSO TRICARE AUDIT LOG File? YES//
  
 Please accept the default answer of YES to this question.
  
 You will also be prompted to enter the coordinator for the new BPS CHAMPVA
 mail group.  Prior to installation, please contact your Medical Care Cost
 Recovery (MCCR) business department (Facility Revenue Manager) to
 determine who will be the coordinator for this new mail group.  The users
 in this mail group will receive bulletins related to the processing of
 CHAMPVA electronic claims.  After the patch is installed, members can be
 added to the mail group by using the Mail Group Edit [XMEDITMG] option.
