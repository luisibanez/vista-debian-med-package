 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000102502 - Deducting current balance after successful in Return
 Medication to Stock
   
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a drug is returned to stock, the following temporary global should
 be updated: ^XTMP("PSA".  This global is used by the Drug Accountability
 Nightly Background job to update inventory reports.  The process works
 for dispensing medication but not when medication is returned.  This is
 because the "Return Medication to Stock" option does not create an entry
 in ^XTMP("PSA".
  
 DISCLAIMER: When "returning medication to stock" using the DELETE A
 PRESCRIPTION option, you are not given the opportunity to return a
 "partial" to stock.  This patch does not change this functionality.
 It is recommended to use the RETURN MEDICATION TO STOCK option before
 "deleting a prescription" if a partial has been dispensed.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routines PSORESK and PSORXDL to create an entry ^XTMP("PSA", so that
 the quantity for the medication being returned to stock is processed by the
 Drug Accountability Nightly Background job.  This will ensure that the follow-
 ing inventory reports reflect the correct inventory balances for the drug
 returned:
  
  a. Drug Balances by Location
  b. Drug Transaction History
  
  
 PSORESK is for "Return medication to stock".
  
 PSORXDL is for "Delete a prescription".  This option will ask the user
 if they want to return medication to stock before deletion.
