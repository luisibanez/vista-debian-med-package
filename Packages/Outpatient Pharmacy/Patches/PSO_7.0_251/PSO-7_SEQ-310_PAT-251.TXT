Description:
============

  
 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the new Medication
 Order Check Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  These patches will
 replace most of the current VistA medication order checking system with
 version 1.0 of the new Medication Order Check Healthcare Application
 (MOCHA) system that uses the First DataBank (FDB) Drug Information 
 Framework (DIF) interfaces and database. The VistA Drug Interaction
 module will be replaced by the FDB Drug-Drug Interaction Module (DDIM).
 The VistA Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the FDB Enhanced
 Therapeutic Classification (ETC) System. In addition, the following
 three order checks that use VistA data have been added to Inpatient
 Medications and Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks currently occur in
 Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), but will be new to Pharmacy
 with the installation of these patches:
  
         Aminoglycoside Ordered
         Dangerous Meds for Patients > 64
         Glucophage - Lab Results
   
  A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced
 called Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only by
 members of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM).  It will allow the NDF
 Support Group to customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
  
  The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
  this release:
         Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
         Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
         Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check display 
         and processing (PSI-07-080)
  
 Please refer to the MOCHA v1.0 Release Notes for additional information.
   
 MOCHA v1.0 consists of two host files: PRE_1_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID,
 PSS_1_136.zip, and two patches PSS*1*117 and PSO*7*375.
 These files and patches contain software that support MOCHA v1.0
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at
  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the phased
 implementation release method for MOCHA v1.0.  To see current status and
 target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team.  Installation information
 for MOCHA v1.0 is included in the VistA to MOCHA v1.0 Interface
 Installation Guide and the MOCHA v1.0 Combined Build Installation Guide.  
  
  
  ************************** WARNING ***************************
  **************************************************************
  If your facility has the Parata or Kirby Lester interface from ILC, this
  patch will overwrite any "local" modifications in routines PSOCAN2,
  PSOCAN3, PSOLBL, PSORXL and PSORXL1. This could affect certain orders
  being sent across this interface.  The modifications will have to be
  reintroduced following installation of this patch.

 Patch Information:
 ===============
  
 PSS_1_136.zip includes the components necessary for the
 interface that will be used in MOCHA v1.0:
  
  PRE_I_3_INTERFACE_BUILD.KID (contains PSS*1*136) 
  PSSPRE_1_0.XML     
  
  PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID includes the following required patches to
 enable the MOCHA v1.0 functionality:
   
  PSO*7*251
  PSJ*5*181

 These patches will be distributed as standalone patches via FORUM and will
 support MOCHA v1.0:
     PSS*1*117
     PSO*7*375
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the phased
 implementation. During each implementation phase, the Implementation Team
 will provide each site the instructions and location to obtain the
 software.
