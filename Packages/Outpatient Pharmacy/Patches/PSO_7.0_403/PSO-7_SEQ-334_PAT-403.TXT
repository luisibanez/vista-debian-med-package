Subject: HIPAA 5010 MAINTENANCE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch finalizes the HIPAA 5010 enhancements by correcting issues
 reported in Remedy tickets and providing other enhancements requested by
 the Central Business Office (CBO) ePharmacy implementation team.
  
 1.  The SMA (Submit Multiple Actions) action on the Third Party Payer
     Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and Third Party Payer
     Rejects - View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options was updated
     to allow a user the capability to enter Drug Utilization Review (DUR)
     overrides without needing to also enter submission clarification
     codes.  (601323)
  
 2.  The SDC (Suspense Date Calc) action on the Third Party Payer Rejects
     - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and Third Party Payer Rejects -
     View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options was updated to get the
     default values for the Last Date of Service and Last Days Supply
     prompts from the previous fill instead of the current fill.  (606020)
  
 3.  After editing the FILL DATE from the Medication Profile, the user
     will now get the LABEL printer prompt when exiting even if there are
     unresolved rejects. This will allow the user to suspend the
     prescription.
  
 4.  Corrected an issue with PP (Pull Rx (OP)) action on the Medication    
     Profile when a rejected TRICARE/CHAMPVA prescription was discontinued
     from the Reject Notification screen.
  
 5.  Updated the code for the CMOP release message to prevent a hard
     error that was occurring when a TRICARE/CHAMPVA prescription was
     resubmitted to ePharmacy and came back with a status of 'IN 
     PROGRESS'.  (608025)

 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
 1. HD0000000601323 - Cannot submit multiple override codes using the
                      Submit Multiple Actions without entering other
                      actions
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The SMA (Submit Multiple Actions) action on the Third Party Payer
 Rejects - Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and Third Party Payer Rejects -
 View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options was not allowing a 
 user the ability to enter DUR override codes without first being required
 to enter at least one Submission Clarification code.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code was modified such that the SMA (Submit Multiple Actions) action 
 does not require the entry of submission clarification codes.
  
  
 2. HD0000000606020 - Correct the Calculate Suspense Date Functionality
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The SDC (Suspense Date Calc) action on the Third Party Payer Rejects -
 Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] and Third Party Payer Rejects -
 View/Process [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] options was defaulting incorrect
 values for the Last Date of Service and Last Days Supply prompts as it was
 getting the values for the claim associated with the current prescription
 instead of the previous prescription.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The code was modified to use the previous prescription when getting the 
 default values for the Last Date of Service and Last Days Supply 
 prompts. For a refill, this means using the previous fill. For an 
 original fill, this means finding a previous prescription for same
 patient and drug. In some cases, there will be no default values because 
 the previous prescription may not exist or the previous prescription or 
 fill may not have been ePharmacy billable.
  
  
 3. HD0000000608025 - <UNDEFINED>LOCK+1^PSORXL1
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a TRICARE or CHAMPVA prescription was resubmitted to ePharmacy by the 
 CMOP release message and is returned with a status of 'IN PROGRESS', the
 code attempts to put the prescription back on suspense.  Unfortunately, 
 the variable PSOSITE is not defined, resulting in an UNDEFINED error.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Prior to putting the prescription back on suspense, the code checks 
 if the variable PSOSITE is defined.  If not, the code will set it to the 
 appropriate value.

 To avoid disruptions, this patch should be installed during non-peak

 claims are being transmitted. Of particular concern would be the options
 below.

      Scheduled Non-CS Transmission [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
      Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being transmitted
      to Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP). Wait for the
      CMOP transmissions to finish or complete the installation before
      the transmissions start. Both the CS (Controlled Substances) and
      the non-CS CMOP transmission options should be checked. Check with
      Pharmacy Service or your Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP
      transmissions occur.
