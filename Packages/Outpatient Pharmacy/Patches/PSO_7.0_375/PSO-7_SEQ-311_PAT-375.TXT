Subject: MOCHA v1.0 (Increment 3) add on patch to PSO*7.0*251

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a group of patches that make up the new Medication
 Order Check Healthcare Application v1.0 (MOCHA).  These patches will replace
 most of the current VistA medication order checking system with version 1.0
 of the new Medication Order Check Healthcare Application (MOCHA) system that
 uses the First DataBank (FDB) Drug Information Framework (DIF) interfaces
 and database. The VistA Drug Interaction module will be replaced by the FDB
 Drug-Drug Interaction Module (DDIM). 
 The VistA Duplicate Class module will be replaced by the FDB Enhanced
 Therapeutic Classification (ETC) System. In addition, the following three
 order checks that use VistA data have been added to Inpatient Medications
 and Outpatient Pharmacy. These checks currently occur in Computerized
 Patient Record System (CPRS), but will be new to Pharmacy with the
 installation of these patches:
  
         Aminoglycoside Ordered
         Dangerous Meds for Patients > 64
         Glucophage - Lab Results
   
 A new Graphical User Interface (GUI) module is also being introduced called
 Pharmacy Enterprise Customization System (PECS), to be used only by members
 of Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM).  It will allow the NDF Support Group
 to customize the data provided by FDB for use in VistA.
  
 The following three patient safety issues have also been addressed in 
 this release:
         Order Checks on PreMix IV Solutions (PSI-06-012)
         Order Check display sequence changes (PSI-07-080)
         Eliminating confusion in Inpatient Medications Order Check display 
         and processing (PSI-07-080)
  
 Please refer to the MOCHA v1.0 Release Notes for additional information.
   
  
 MOCHA v1.0 consists of two host files: PSS_1_136.zip,
 PRE_1_3_INTERFACE_BUILD_T31.KID, and two patches PSS*1*117 and PSO*7*375.
 These files and patches contain software that support MOCHA v1.0
 functionality. The host files were created to simplify installation at
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the
 phased implementation release method for MOCHA v1.0.  To see current
 status and target dates for Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the
 following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx 
  
 Sites will be provided instructions and guidance on installation and
 implementation by the MOCHA Implementation team.  Installation information
 for MOCHA v1.0 is included in the VistA to MOCHA v1.0 Interface Installation
 Guide and the MOCHA v1.0 Combined Build Installation Guide.  
                                                                 
  
  ************************** WARNING ***************************
  **************************************************************
  If your facility has the Parata or Kirby Lester interface from ILC, this
  patch will overwrite any "local" modifications in routines PSOCAN2 and
  PSOCAN3. This could affect certain orders being sent across this
  interface. The modifications will have to be reintroduced following
  installation of this patch.
  **************************************************************
  ************************************************************** 
  
  
 Patch Information:
 PSS_1_136.zip includes the components necessary for the interface that
 will be used in MOCHA v1.0:
  PRE_I_3_INTERFACE_BUILD.KID (contains PSS*1*136) 
  PSSPRE_1_0.XML     
  
 PRE_I_3_PHARMACY_BUILD.KID includes the following required patches to enable
 the MOCHA v1.0 functionality:
  PSO*7*251
  PSJ*5*181
  OR*3*272
  
 These patches will be distributed as stand alone patches via FORUM and
 will support MOCHA v1.0:
  PSS*1*117
  PSO*7*375
  
 The software will be distributed in a controlled process due to the phased
 implementation.  During each implementation phase, the Implementation Team
 will provide each site the instructions and location to obtain the software.
  
 This patch, PSO*7*375, should be installed immediately after the MOCHA 
 1.0 patch group.
  
 This patch contains the following:
  
 1. Corrects a problem when a tech/clerk reinstates a prescription
 from previously being discontinued.  The problem occurs when the site
 parameter VERFICATION (#.12) field in the OUTPATIENT SITE (#59) file is set
 to 'No' and a user does not hold the PSORPH key and reinstates a
 prescription, the prescription gets put into a 'NON-VERIFIED' status.  In
 this situation the prescription should have a status of 'ACTIVE'.
  
 2. Corrects a problem when a tech/clerk enters a new duplicate
 drug and the confirmation message that the duplicate drug order was
 discontinued did not display when it should have displayed.
  
 3. During dosing edit, the messages for "no GCNSEQNO" and "not 
 matched to NDF" is displaying once during dosing and again when 
 enhanced order checks are performed.  A modification was made to 
 correct this issue.
  
 4. The exception message displayed for a free text dosage is formatted 
 incorrectly and wrapping inappropriately. Additionally changes
 were made to eliminate extra spaces.
  
 5. Corrects a problem where the SIG for duplicate therapy med orders did not
 format and display correctly (ccr3803).
  
 6. Modifications have been made to exit order checks more efficiently 
 (CCR 3779).
  
 7. Corrected a hard error within the Discontinue Prescription(s) [PSO C] 
 option (3813).
  
 8. Corrects a problem when copying an Rx and the duplicate therapy Rx 
 list selected for deletion does not re-display the complete list of Rxs
 to be deleted as a duplicate therapy (ccr 3817).
  
 9. OP Intervention Hidden Action When viewing interventions via the View
 Intervention prompt data does not display correctly. Data is displayed until
 screen has filled and then overlaps on bottom few lines. The user cannot
 view the intervention due to scrolling issue (ccr 3821).
  
 10. Corrected double return prompts occurring during new order entry in a 
 scenario with 2 duplicate non-va medications (CCR 3824).
  
 11. Corrected phantom sig from remote orders occurring when there is a 
 therapeutic duplication with a local medication (CCR 3823).
  
 12. Corrects issue where text from remote SIG carries forward to next
 remote message (CCR 3826).
  
 13. Corrects order check sequence. (CCR 3832)
  
 14. IP REQ 3.8.10.28 Failing - no Therapeutic Duplication messages for OP
 Therapeutic Duplication Discontinued Meds (ccr 3837).
  
 15. Hard error during clerk reinstate of an rx with a duplicate drug non-va
 med (ccr 3851).
  
 16. IP Remote Rx display in Therapeutic Duplication warning does not match
 the SRS and FR 3.8.10.16 (ccr 3853).
