Description:
============

 This patch contains software modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy (OP)
 V. 7.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
 project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
 Guide for prescription items that contain FDA approved information that
 can help patients avoid adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
 Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products
 when the Agency determines that:
  
  . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
  . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
    serious side effect with a product, or 
  . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
    to its effectiveness. 
  
 The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
 incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
 features included in this release are:
  
  . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
    the VA network.
  
  . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
    corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
    the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
  
  . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
    automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
    software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
    bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
    identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
    automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
    user via the Internet Explorer browser. 
   
  . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
    GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
    displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
  
  . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
    [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
    for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific 
    prescription.
    
 Below is a list of all the applications involved in this release along
 with their patch number:

 The FDA Medication Guides project is expected to complete in three 
 increments. Among other features, the next Increment will automate the 
 printing of FDA Medication Guides for prescriptions dispensed by the VA
 via Outpatient Pharmacy application when the prescription label is printed.
    
 The following modification is included in this patch (PSO*7*343):
   
 Patient Prescription Processing [PSO LM BACKDOOR ORDERS] option
  
  Pharmacists will be able to retrieve an FDA Medication Guide for a 
  specific prescription by selecting the prescription and invoking the OTH
  (Other OP Actions) hidden action and choosing the new item MG Display FDA
  Medication Guide. A Java software component running at the user's PC will 
  then display the FDA Medication Guide Adobe Acrobat document (.pdf) by 
  automatically opening it via the user's default web browser, which will
  allow the users to print it to any printer available to them, as seen 
  below:
        
                    --- Other OP Actions ---
   PN   Progress Note (OP)
   AP   Action Profile (OP)
   MI   Print Medication Instructions
   DO   Display Orders' Statuses
   MG   Display FDA Medication Guide
  
   Select Item(s): MG   Display FDA Medication Guide  
   
   The following URL provides the link to the FDA Medication Guide associated
   with this medication. Thin Client users: copy/paste the URL below into a
   browser to access the FDA Medication Guide for this drug:
  
   vaww.national.cmop.va.gov/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
  
   Please wait... 
  
     [FDA Medication Guide .pdf document opens on the web browser]
  
   
  If a user tries to use this option from a computer which does not have the 
  required Java software component installed, the following message will 
  display:
  
   Select Item(s): MG   Display FDA Medication Guide  
  
   The following URL provides the link to the FDA Medication Guide associated
   with this medication. Thin Client users: copy/paste the URL below into a
   browser to access the FDA Medication Guide for this drug:
  
   vaww.national.cmop.va.gov/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
  
   Please wait... 
     
   The system is unable to display FDA Med Guide automatically.
   
   The FDA Medication Guide will not automatically open on Thin Client and some
   types of encrypted sessions. If you do not believe this is the reason contact
   your local technical support for assistance.
  
   You can copy/paste the link above into your browser's address bar to retrieve
   the FDA Medication Guide.
    
   Enter RETURN to continue, '?' for HELP, or '^' to exit: ?
  
   When unable to get the FDA Medication Guide to display, review the following
   suggestion(s) for troubleshooting potential problems:
   
   1) The browser did not open automatically. This may be due to the following:
      - You might be connected to VistA via Thin Client or an encrypted session
        that prevents the FDA Med Guide from automatically displaying. Please
        copy and paste the URL link below into your browser's address bar to
        retrieve the FDA Medication Guide:
  
    vaww.national.cmop.va.gov/FDAMedGuides/Lindane_Lotion_(Generic)_(2008).pdf
  
      - The computer might not have the required Java software component
        installed or the software might not be functioning properly. Please,
        contact technical support for assistance.
  
   2) When doing a copy/paste of the link into the browser's address and an HTTP
      404 - File Not Found error is received. This may be due to the following:
      - A common issue exists when the link is displayed in two lines in the
        terminal screen. When you copy both lines at the same time and paste it
        into the browser's address, the second line is ignored by the browser
        resulting in a 'broken' link. To resolve this issue, copy and paste one
        line at a time from the terminal screen into the browser's address to
        make sure the complete link is used.
      - The FDA Medication Guide Server may be down at the moment. Please, wait
        a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, contact technical
        support for assistance.
  
   3) The browser opened automatically, however you receive an HTTP 404 - File
      Not Found error. This may be due to the following:
      - The FDA Medication Guide Server may be down at the moment. Please, wait
        a few minutes and try again. If the problem persists, contact technical
        support for assistance.
   
   
   If a user tries to use this option for a medication that does not have
   an FDA Medication Guide on file, the following message will display: 
  
       Select Item(s): MG   Display FDA Medication Guide  
      
       There is no FDA Medication Guide associated with this medication.
  
    Enter RETURN to continue, '?' for HELP, or '^' to exit: ?
  
    When unable to get the FDA Medication Guide to display, review the following
    suggestion(s) for troubleshooting potential problems:
  
    1) If no FDA Medication Guide exists for a product that you believe should
       have one, confirm that one is required by visiting the FDA website
       (www.fda.gov). If one is required, log a support ticket to request its
       addition. Please understand that there may be a delay between the time
       that a new Medication Guide is posted to the FDA website and when it is
       made available in VistA through a National Drug File data update patch.
   
   
   Note: This option requires a Java software component to be installed on
   ----  the user's computer. This software will be released as part of this
         project. Please, refer to the project Release Notes and Installation
         Guide documentation for further information.
