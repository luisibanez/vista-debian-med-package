Subject: MESSEGE MODIFICATION FOR RESTRICTED REFILLS/CORRECT MISSPELLED WORD

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch resolves the following two issues:
  
    1) Provide users a more accurate description as to why a refill is not
       allowed.
  
    2) Correct the misspelling of "prescription" in a CPRS pop-up box.
  
  
 Associated Remedy Ticket(s):
 ============================
 1) HD0000000420136 - Getting message preventing refills due to "This drug
                      has been changed, No refills allowed"

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000420136 - Getting message preventing refills due to "This drug
                      has been changed, No refills allowed"
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users receive a warning message stating the following: "This drug has been
 changed no refills allowed."  This message is too broad and needs to provide
 a more detailed description as to why a refill is being denied.
  
 The functionality that generates this message restricts refills based two
 different criteria. They are the "DEA Special Handling code" and the number
 of refills allowed based on the "days supply".
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 The current message will be replaced with two new messages. One based on the
 "DEA Special Handling code", and the other based on refills allowed per days
 supply.
  
 The following new messages have been approved by the PLE User Group:
   1 - Current drug DEA/SPECIAL HANDLING code does not allow refills
   2 - Requested refill exceeds maximum allowable days supply for Rx
  
 The following routines will be modified: PSOATRF,PSOATFRC,PSOREF0 and PSOUTLA1
  
 2) HD0000000475366 - Misspelled word in cprs pop-up box
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When attempting to renew a prescription, in CPRS, users receive a warning
 message in which the word "prescription" is misspelled.  This occurs when
 users try to renew a prescription that is NOT renewable.
                                          
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine PSORENW to correct the spelling error for the following warning
 messaged displayed in CPRS: "Prescription is in a Non-Renewable Status."
