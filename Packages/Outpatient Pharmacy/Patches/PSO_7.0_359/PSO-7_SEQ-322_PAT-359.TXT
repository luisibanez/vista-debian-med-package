Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements that extend the capabilities of the Veterans
 Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) electronic
 pharmacy (ePharmacy) billing system.  Below is a list of all the
 applications involved in this project along with their patch number:
  
    APPLICATION/VERSION                                  PATCH
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPATIENT PHARMACY (OP) V. 7.0                      PSO*7*359
    INTEGRATED BILLING (IB) V. 2.0                       IB*2*435
    ELECTRONIC CLAIMS MANAGEMENT ENGINE (ECME) V. 1.0    BPS*1*10
    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (PRCA) V. 4.5                    PRCA*4.5*271
  
 The four patches (PSO*7*359, IB*2*435, BPS*1*10, and PRCA*4.5*271) are
 being released in the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
 multi-build distribution BPS PSO IB PRCA BUNDLE 6.0.  For more specific
 instructions please refer to the installation steps provided in each of
 the patches.
  
 For the pharmacy claims that are processed electronically, the ePharmacy 
 module is currently compliant with the National Council for Prescription 
 Drug Programs (NCPDP) industry standards for version 5.1. NCPDP version 
 D.0 Level 1 compliance (completion of internal testing) must be in place 
 by January 1, 2011, and it must have completed external testing with 
 payers and be in production as of January 1, 2012. Meeting the deliverable
 dates is essential to VHA meeting this legislative mandate and for
 continued business with pharmacy payers. As part of these changes, VHA
 should also have backwards compatibility to the NCPDP version 5.1 to allow
 for continued revenue and processing of VHA pharmacy claims.
  
 This combined build will allow the processing and release of prescriptions
 for patients with Insurance payers that use the new NCPDP version D.0 
 format for electronic claims processing as well as the current NCPDP
 version 5.1 format.
  
 This specific patch contains functionality for the following:
  
   1. Added a new hidden action to the Reject Information screen to
      display additional reject information returned by the third-party
      payer.  The data includes payer messages and DUR reject information.
      A plus (+) sign in front of the DUR Text label in the REJECT
      Information section will indicate to the user that there is 
      additional reject information available to view using the ARI
      (View Addtnl Rej Info) hidden action.
  
   2. To support the latest NCPDP standard vD.0, the values that can
      be entered at the Prior Authorization Type prompt for the PA (Submit
      Prior Auth.) hidden action have been updated.
  
      The previous values allowed for selection were as follows:
        0       NOT SPECIFIED
        1       PRIOR AUTHORIZATION
        2       MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
        3       EPSDT
        4       EXEMPTION FROM COPAY
        5       EXEMPTION FROM RX LIMITS
        6       FAMILY PLANNING INDICATOR
        7       AFDC
   
      The new values are as follows:
        0       NOT SPECIFIED
        1       PRIOR AUTHORIZATION
        2       MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
        3       EPSDT
        4       EXEMPT FROM COPAY/COINSURANCE
        5       EXEMPT FROM RX
        6       FAMILY PLANNING INDICATOR
        7       TANF
        8       PAYER DEFINED EXEMPTION
        9       EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
  
   3. The data displayed on the Reject Information screens has
      been synchronized to be consistent for both TRICARE and 
      Veteran patients.  In addition, this screen was updated to
      synchronize the display more closely with the Print Claim Log
      action of the ECME User Screen [BPS USER SCREEN] option.
  
   4. To support the latest NCPDP standard vD.0, the ECME number
      associated with electronic claims was updated from a length
      of 7 digits to 12 digits.  The old ECME number of 7 digit
      length will still be supported but in all Outpatient Pharmacy
      screens where the ECME number is either displayed or prompted
      the 12 digit length is now supported.
  
   5. To support the latest NCPDP standard vD.0, the Reject
      Information screen will allow the submission of up to three
      Submission Clarification codes using the hidden CLA (Submit
      Clarif. Code) action. Version 5.1 claims will continue to allow
      only one code per claim.

 Overview of Remedy Tickets:
 ---------------------------
 1. HD375552  <UNDEFINED>ALLERGY+3^PSOORUT2
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An undefined error occurs when viewing a prescription using the View  
 Prescriptions [PSO VIEW] option and then jumping to the Rx Verification
 by Clerk [PSO VR] option. Variable PS is not killed when View 
 Prescriptions has finished processing. This ultimately leads to the 
 killing of the patient DFN variable.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify View Prescriptions to clean up variable PS when this option has 
 finished processing. In routine PSORXVW kill variable PS upon exit from 
 this routine.
  
  
 2. HD477916  BPS NOT PROCESSING
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An endless loop occurred at Salisbury when processing an NCPDP response.
 As a result, other NCPDP responses could not be processed.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified procedure HOSTREJ^PSOREJU2 so that it properly initializes all 
 variables.
  
  
 3. HD447910  Screen changes to odd characters when labels are queued to
              print
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Printing labels from the Third Party Payer Rejects - View/Process
 [PSO REJECTS VIEW/PROCESS] or the Third Party Payer Rejects - 
 Worklist [PSO REJECTS WORKLIST] options did not always work
 properly.  At times, the labels would print to the screen instead
 of the selected printer device.  Not only would the labels not 
 print, but depending on the escape sequences defined for the 
 printer device, the terminal screens would end up garbled and
 impossible to read.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The label printing functionality was modified to queue the label 
 print if the printer device is set to forced queuing.  For 
 devices not set up with forced queuing, the code validates that the
 selected printer device is available to use.  If not, the message
 'Printer is busy' is displayed instead of trying to print the label.

 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 The post-installation routine is POST^PSO7P359.  The purpose of the 
 post-installation routine is to reset the temporary cache of hidden 
 actions associated with the Reject Information Screen hidden menus. This
 will allow the new ARI hidden action to display when the user enters a
 double question (??) at the "Select:" prompt.
  
 The post-installation routine is automatically deleted by KIDS if
 allowed by your local Kernel parameters configuration.  You may delete 
 the PSO7P359 routine if the installation was successful and it is not 
 automatically deleted by KIDS.
          
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
  
 Do not queue the installation of this patch.
  
 To avoid disruptions, these patches should be installed during non-peak
 hours when there is minimal activity on the system.  Avoid times when ECME
 claims are being transmitted.  Of particular concern would be the options
 below.
  
     1. [BPS NIGHTLY BACKGROUND JOB]
        Do not install the patch when ECME claims are being generated
        by the BPS Nightly Background Job option.  Wait for this job to
        finish or complete the installation before this job starts.
  
     2. [PSXR SCHEDULED CS TRANS] and
        [PSXR SCHEDULED NON-CS TRANS]
        Do not install the patch when prescriptions are being
        transmitted to CMOP.  Wait for the CMOP transmissions to finish
        or complete the installation before the transmissions start. Both
        the CS (Controlled Substances) and the non-CS CMOP transmission
        options should be checked.  Check with Pharmacy Service or your
        Pharmacy ADPAC to find out when CMOP transmissions occur.
  
  
 Install Time
 ------------
 The installation will take between 10 and 90 minutes depending upon how
 many entries your site has in the BPS CLAIMS file (9002313.02) and in the
 BPS RESPONSES file (9002313.03).  Data conversions will be run in both
 files and all entries will be checked during the installation of BPS*1*10.
  
  
 1.  OBTAIN PATCHES
     --------------
     Obtain the host file BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID, which contains the
     following patches:
  
         BPS*1.0*10
         PSO*7.0*359
         IB*2.0*435
         PRCA*4.5*271
  
      Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
      The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
                     download.vista.med.va.gov
  
      This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
      Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
      server as follows:
  
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
      The BPS_1_10_PSO_IB_PRCA.KID host file is located in the 
      anonymous.software directory. Use ASCII Mode when downloading the
