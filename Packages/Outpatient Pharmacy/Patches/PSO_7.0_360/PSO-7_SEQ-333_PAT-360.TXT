 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 HD0000000459019   Outpatient RX Profile displayed two different patient names.
   
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 While reviewing the code that generates the Outpatient RX Profile report it 
 was discovered that the variable LINE is not being renewed within the routine.
  
 The Outpatient RX Profile report, via CPRS, is separated into three sections. 
 In the code for the second and third sections of the report the variable LINE
 is renewed to eliminate the possibility of any extraneous characters that 
 could show up in the separation lines of the report.  For the first section 
 this variable is not renewed.
  
 ** Cincinnati VAMC had reported an issue where information was showing up
    in the separator lines in the first part of the Outpatient RX Profile 
    report.  This issue has not reoccurred at the site and we have not 
    been able to reproduce it.  The change we have made to the routine 
    will eliminate the possibility of extraneous characters showing up 
    in the separator lines.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Modify the routine PSOSD1 to set the variable LINE to null prior to populating 
 it with dashes.
