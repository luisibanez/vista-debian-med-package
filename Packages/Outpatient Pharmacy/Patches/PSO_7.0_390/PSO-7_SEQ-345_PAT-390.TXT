 ***************************Attention************************* 
  
 This patch is part of the Medication Order Check Healthcare Application 
 (MOCHA)v1.0 Enhancements 1 group of patches. There are a total of eight 
 patches and one .kid (host) file that must be installed as a group.  The 
 patches must be installed in the following order:
  
 OR*3*352
 PSS*1*164
 PSS*1*169
 PSO*7*390
 PSO*7*417
 PSJ*5*268
 <xxx>_1_0_P23.kid
 PSJ*5*260
 PSJ*5*288
  
 For the ".kid" file, value of <xxx> will be determined by the ward 
 automated dispensing equipment in use at your facility.  If no ward 
 automated dispensing equipment is in use at your site, this file will 
 not be needed. For those sites using Pyxis, xxx=PPU, for Omnicell sites,
 xxx=OPU, and for McKesson sites, xxx=MPU.  To obtain this file or if 
 additional information is required regarding this ".kid" file, please 
 contact your site's Informatix contact.
   
 *** IMPORTANT *** 
 PSO*7*417 must be installed immediately after 
 installation of PSO*7*390. PSO*7*417 addresses a potential undefined 
 error when renewing prescriptions without an allergy order check.
  
 ***NOTE***
 After installation of this patch the second line of routine PSORENW 
 is missing patch 388, and the second line of routine PSORXI is missing 
 patch 387.  This will be corrected with patch PSO*7*417 which is part 
 of this release, and which should be installed immediately following 
 installation of this patch.

    1. Add menu option Check Drug Interaction [PSO CHECK DRUG INTERACTION]
       to the Outpatient Pharmacy Manager [PSO MANAGER], Pharmacist Menu 
       [PSO USER1] and Rx (Prescriptions) [PSO RX] menus
  
   2. Add ListMan hidden action [DX Check Interactions] to the Outpatient
      Pharmacy medication profile template [PSO LM ACTIVE ORDERS]
  
   3. Add Inpatient Medication Orders for Outpatient (IMO) to the 
      Drug-Drug Interaction and Therapeutic Duplication order checks
  
   4. Add Sign/symptoms to the Allergy/ADR order check display 
      (remote/local).
  
   5. Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) and Body Surface Area (BSA) will be 
      added to the Outpatient Medication Profile and Patient Information
      Headers
  
   6. Add Observed/Historical and Severity to allergy/ADR warning display
      info
  
   7. CPRS will incorporate the changes made in Backdoor Outpatient 
      Pharmacy to include IMO orders in OP Enhanced Order Checks
  
   8. The word 'Pending Order' will be changed to 'Pending Drug'
  
   9. Patch OR*3*352, which is included in this project release, created the
      Drug Allergies sub-file in the Order Check Instances file (#100.05).
      After installation of the MOCHA V1.0 Enhancement 1 patches,
      Drug-Allergy order checks that occur in back door pharmacy will be
