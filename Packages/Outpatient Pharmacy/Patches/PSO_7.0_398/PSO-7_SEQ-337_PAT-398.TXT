Subject: DC'd RX REINSTATED IN ERROR/EXCLUSIONARY CHECK/PSO HI COST REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

     This patch addresses the following issues:
  
   1) While reinstating a prescription previously discontinued by entering
      a "date of death" for a patient, the user is prompted as to whether
      or not they wish to continue. This question occurs for patients that
      do NOT have an allergy assessment. If the user accepts the default of
      "NO" or enters an up-arrow (caret), the DISCONTINUED prescription is
      reinstated anyway.
  
   2) When an EXCLUSIONARY CHECK is updated/modified, the CHECKED BY field
      is not getting updated.
  
   3) The PSO HI COST REPORT does not honor the "^" to exit.

   Remedy Overview:
   ================
   1)  HD0000000234287 - Reinstating an order and generating a critical drug
                         interaction.
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When a DOD (date of death) is entered for patients with active prescriptions,
   their status changes from ACTIVE to DISCONTINUED. When the user attempts to
   reinstate them, they have to respond to the following question:
  
   "There is no allergy assessment on file for this patient."
   "You will be prompted to intervene if you continue with this prescription"
   "Do you want to Continue?: N//"
  
   Before the user responds to the stated question, the prescription status
   is already set to ACTIVE.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify routine PSODRG. If the user accepts the default of "NO" or enters an
   up-arrow (caret), re-set the status of the prescription to DISCONTINUE. 
  
  
  
   2)   HD0000000520980 - Exclusionary Check
  
   Problem:
   --------
   In the New Person file (#200), when the DATE EXCLUSIONARY LIST CHECKED 
   field (#53.94) and the ON EXCLUSIONARY LIST field (#53.95) are updated
   the EXCLUSIONARY CHECKED BY field (#53.96) is not getting updated with
   the editing users name.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Made a modification to routine PSOPRVW to check for updates on either of
   these two fields.  If there is an update, then the EXCLUSIONARY CHECK BY 
   field (#53.96) will be updated with the user's name.
  
   3)   HD0000000513921 - PSO HI COST report does not honor "^" to exit
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When printing the PSO HI COST REPORT to the screen at the end of each page
   the prompt "Press Return to Continue or ^ to Exit:" is displayed.  When
   entering the "^" the prompt repeats it's self and does not exit the report.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Made a modification to PSOCST10 so that when the "^" is used to exit the
   report, that it actually will exit.
