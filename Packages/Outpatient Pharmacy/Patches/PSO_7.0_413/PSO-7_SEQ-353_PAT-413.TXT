   Remedy Overview:
   ================
   1) HD0000000734927 - The Discontinue Prescription(s) option [PSO C]
                        terminated when a patient has a confirmed death.
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When a user tries to DISCONTINUE a prescription on a deceased patient they   
   receive the following message: RECORDING THAT AN ERROR OCCURRED
  
   The actual error is an undefined error in routine PSOCAN. The error is
   generated because the logic for a deceased patient does not get executed.
  
   The error occurs while using the Discontinue Prescription(s) option 
   [PSO C].
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modify routine PSOCAN to properly execute the logic for a deceased patient.
  
  
  
   2) HD0000000754039 - User is able to discontinue a prescription that has
                        been "marked for deletion".
  
   Problem:
   --------
   Users are able to DISCONTINUE prescriptions that has been "marked for
   deletion" when using the Discontinue Prescription(s) option [PSO C].
  
   Upon entering the prescription the user should get a message stating that
   a prescription "marked for deletion" is an invalid choice.
   
   
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Modify routine PSOCAN so that users are not able to discontinue prescriptions
   "marked for deletion", and that the message stating as such is displayed.
