Subject: CORRECTIONS TO MEDICATION WORKSHEET (TOOL #2)

Category:

  - Other

Description:
============

 Patches PSO*7*316 and GMTS*2.7*92 correct issues reported with the 
 Tool #2: Medication Worksheet. The Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*92
 will require patch PSO*7*316 and will create a national entry in the
 HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) for Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
  
 1. The existing Application Program Interface (API) #4827 did not
    return fields required by Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Routine PSS^PSO59 returns data about the demographics of outpatient 
 pharmacy divisions, such as site name and address.  The existing API did 
 not return the division's assigned area code and phone number, which are 
 present in the format of Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch modifies routine PSO59 to return the AREA CODE field (#.03)
 and PHONE NUMBER field (#.04) as part of the target array.
  
 2.  Routine PSOQUAP distributed with patch PSO*7*294 is not used.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During testing of patch PSO*7*294, changes were made that resulted in 
 routine PSOQUAP being no longer required.  The routine was left in the 
 patch at the time in order to reduce the remaining testing time required.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch removes routine PSOQUAP.  There are no known programs that 
 call this routine.
  
 3.  PSO*7*294 was noncompliant with Programming Standards and 
     Conventions (SAC) for VistA applications.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 During the internal review of some of the routines distributed with 
 PSO*7*294 findings uncovered some SAC standard violations.  Primarily, 
 there was a lack of documentation for Integration Agreements for calls 
 being made from routine PSOQMCAL.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Routines PSOQ0186 and PSOQMCAL are being replaced with GMTSPST2.  
 Moving the routines to the Health Summary (GMTS) namespace
 facilitates the appropriate documentation of Integration 
 Agreements.  Corresponding Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*92 creates a
 national Health Summary component for Tool #2: Medication Worksheet to
 utilize the replacement routines.
