Description:
============

 The Pharmacy Legacy Enhancements (PLE) Increment 9 Release includes the 
 following modifications to the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application:
  
 1. Prescription HOLD/UNHOLD Functionality
    --------------------------------------
    a.  The HOLD REASON field (#99) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) has the
        following set of codes, which is presented to the PSORPH key holder
        during prescription 'HOLD' process:
  
        '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
        '2 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION'
        '3 PATIENT REACTION'
        '4 PHYSICIAN TO BE CONTACTED'
        '5 ALLERGY REACTIONS'
        '6 DRUG REACTION'
        '7 BAD ADDRESS'
        '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
        '99 OTHER--SEE COMMENTS'
   
         As per the recommendation of the Pharmacy User Group the 
         following changes were made to the set of codes:
  
         The following new codes were added:
         '9 CONSULT/PRIOR APPROVAL NEEDED'
         '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
         
         The following code descriptions were modified:
         '4 PHYSICIAN TO BE CONTACTED' to '4 PROVIDER TO BE CONTACTED'
         '6 DRUG REACTION' to '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION'
         '99 OTHER--SEE COMMENTS' to 'OTHER/RPH (CLINICAL)'
  
         The following codes were removed as they were redundant and code
         '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION' to be used in its place:
         '3 PATIENT REACTION' 
         '5 ALLERGY REACTIONS' 
  
         Note:
         A post-install routine has been included in this patch that will
         convert the historical data of codes '3' and '5' to code '6'. 
  
         On complete installation of this patch, the HOLD REASON field 
         (#99) of the PRESCRIPTION file (#52) will have the following set
         of codes:
         '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
         '2 DRUG-DRUG INTERACTION'
         '4 PROVIDER TO BE CONTACTED'
         '6 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION'
         '7 BAD ADDRESS'
         '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
         '9 CONSULT/PRIOR APPROVAL NEEDED'
         '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
         '99 OTHER/RPH (CLINICAL)'
  
    b. New Security Key PSO TECH ADV for pharmacy technicians
       A new security key called PSO TECH ADV has been created, which 
       will allow a user to HOLD a prescription using one of the following
       HOLD reasons, which are a subset of the hold reasons that are
       available to the PSORPH key holders in item (a) above:
  
       '1 INSUFFICIENT QTY IN STOCK'
       '7 BAD ADDRESS'
       '8 PER PATIENT REQUEST'
       '98 OTHER/TECH (NON-CLINICAL)'
  
       The PSO TECH ADV key holders will be able to remove a prescription
       from HOLD only for the above hold reasons whether they were put 
       on HOLD by the PSORPH key holder or by the PSO TECH ADV key holder.
  
    c. UNHOLD Comments
       The UNHOLD action has been modified to display the original hold 
       reason along with the hold comments (if any) as seen in the example
       below:
       
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Select Action: Next Screen// UH   UH  UNHOLD                        |
 | Nature of Order: WRITTEN//        W                                 |
 |                                                                     |
 | HOLD COMMENTS: HOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER MANUALLY. (REASON: |
 |                BAD ADDRESS) on MAY 10, 2012                         |
 |                                                                     |
 | UNHOLD COMMENTS:                                                    |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
    d. Rx Activity Log
       All activities related to HOLD/UNHOLD action on a prescription will
       be captured in the activity log as seen below:
  
      
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Activity Log:                                                       |
 | #   Date        Reason         Rx Ref         Initiator Of Activity |
 | ...                                                                 |
 | 8   05/10/12    HOLD           REFILL 1       USER,PHARMACY         |
 | Comments: Rx placed on HOLD (Reason: BAD ADDRESS) and removed from  |
 |           SUSPENSE - HOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER MANUALLY.    |
 | ...                                                                 |
 | 9   05/10/12    UNHOLD         REFILL 1       USER,PHARMACY         |
 | Comments: Rx Removed from HOLD - UNHOLD COMMENTS ENTERED BY THE USER|
 |           WHEN REMOVING THE RX FROM HOLD.                           |
 +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  
  
 2. Flagging/Unflagging of a pending renewal order
    ----------------------------------------------
    The flagging/unflagging functionality was limited to new pending orders
    only from Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) V. 3.0. Changes
    were made to extend this functionality to pending renewal orders from
    CPRS as well.
    Note: Flagging/Unflagging is a functionality for the pharmacist (PSORPH
          key holders) only.
  
 3. Non-holders of PSORPH key were able to unflag pending orders
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    The action FL (Flag/Unflag) is blocked for users without the PSORPH
    key when finishing a new pending order. However, if the user selected 
    FN (Finish) to finish a new flagged pending order the software was
    allowing the user to unflag the pending order. This has been changed
    to no longer allow non-holders of the PSORPH key to unflag pending 
    orders.
  
 4. Non PSORPH key holder access to Edit/DC actions
    -----------------------------------------------
    When processing pending new/renewal orders from CPRS, a non PSORPH key
    holder could use the actions 'Edit' or 'Discontinue' on the order, 
    which should not be allowed. This functionality has been disabled.
  
 5. COMMENT field (#.05) in the ACTIVITY LOG sub-file (#52.3) of the 
    PRESCRIPTION file (#52)
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    The length of this field has been increased from 75 to 100 characters
    long to accommodate HOLD and UNHOLD comments.
   
 6. PSO52API API (Application Programming Interface)
    ------------------------------------------------
    This API was modified to check if the prescription's expiration date 
    is in the past. If it is and the current prescription status is not
    DISCONTINUED, DELETED, or EXPIRED, the API will update the prescription
    status to EXPIRED. The API will also send updates to CPRS and Health
    Data Repository (HDR) of the status change.
