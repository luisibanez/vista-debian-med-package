Associated patches: (v)XM*8*27     <<= must be installed BEFORE `XM*8*44'

Subject: LINUX SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides the ability to run the VistA Mailman listeners under
 xinetd on Cache/Linux systems.  Xinetd is software for managing incoming 
 connections over TCP/IP ports on Linux and Unix systems similarly to 
 VMS TCPIP Services used on VMS systems.  All sites should install this 
 patch regardless of their operating system, but for sites using Linux 
 there are additional installation steps for configuring the listeners. 
  
 Sites that use Mailman on Linux are required to configure their Mailman 
 Listener to run under xinetd if they have not already done so.  This is VHA's 
 standard for Linux systems and is recommended by both Engineering 
 Services and Product Support.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000491950 - Linux XINETD support
                          
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 In order to support the shift to Linux based operating systems
 modifications are necessary to the TCPIP entry point in Mailman.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the TCPIP entry point in Mailman so that it works for both
 VMS and Linux based Operating Systems.
   
  
  
        ================INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS =================
 ***************************************************************************** 
 Users may be on the system.  You do not need to stop TaskMan, but you 
 should stop the background filer.  Failure to do so may result in "source 
 routine edited" errors.
  
 On the Manage MailMan:Local Delivery Management menu, use the following 
 option to stop the background filer:
        STOP background filer
 Are you sure you want the BACKGROUND FILERS to STOP delivering mail? NO// YES
                                                                           ===
 << Background filer will stop soon. >>
 *****************************************************************************
  
    1. Choose the PackMan message containing this patch and invoke the
       INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE PackMan option.  
   
    2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select 
       the Installation menu.  
   
    3. From this menu, you may select to use the following options: 
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter XM*8.0*44)
   
         a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
             you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
             transport global.
         b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
             the components of the KIDS build.
         c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
             allow you to view all changes that will be made when this patch
             is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
             (routines, DD's, templates, etc.).
         d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
             message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
             backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
    4. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package XM*8.0*44.
  
  
    5. When Prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
       NO//" respond NO.

       Protocols? NO//" respond NO.
  
    7.  Start the background filer.
        On the Manage MailMan:Local Delivery Management menu, use the
        Following option to start the background filer:
        START background filer
 << Background filer will start soon. >>
  
  
 Instructions for Configuring xinetd Mailman Listener on Linux Systems:
 ==========================================================================
 ***NOTE: Only Linux systems currently running MailMan would need to 
    have changes made beyond the patch install. 
  
 1)  A single user account must be established, named '<scd>tcpip' 
 where <scd> should be replaced with the three character site code 
 assigned by the Regional Data Center, for the use of the TCP/IP listeners 
 that will run under xinetd.  If a user account has not yet been 
 established for that purpose and you need assistance then please enter 
 a Remedy ticket for Product Support.
  
 2)  Each Mailman port number used will be the standard SMTP port 25.
 **************************************************************************
 NOTE: For steps 3) and 4), Xinetd configuration files will be 
 distributed to all Linux sites as template files, so they should already 
 exist. If needed, please enter a Remedy ticket to request assistance from 
 Product Support. 
 **************************************************************************
    
 3)  An xinetd configuration file is required for the VistA Mailman 
 listener.  The file should be located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory and 
 should be named <scd>_xmb<x>, where <scd> is the local three letter site 
 code assigned by the Regional Data Center, and <x> replaced with a 'p' 
 for production systems, 't' on test systems, or 'l' on legacy systems.  
 The file may be edited using the Linux vi editor. 
   
 The contents of the configuration file is as follows, except that these 
 parameters need to be modified:
  
        user   - Set to the name of the user established per step 1) above.
        port   - Set to the port number to the standard SMTP port 25
        bind   - Set to the IP address of the interface that the VistA 
                 configuration alias the service should be bound to.
        env    - Modify the value of the TZ environment variable to match 
                 your site's time zone.
        server - In the example Cache' is shown to be installed in 
                 the /srv/vista/lbe/cache/lber1tsvr directory.  Change
                 it to match your system. 
   server_args - In the example the Cache' configuration name is 
                 'lber1tsvr' and the login namespace is shown as
                 LBETST. Change it to match your system.

     instances = UNLIMITED
     per_source = UNLIMITED
 }
  
 #end
  
  
 4)  Shutdown the current Vista mailman listener. 
  
     1.  Stop the MailMan Listener on all nodes. You will need to 
         perform the steps below on each Node where you run a 
         MailMan Listener.
  
     1.1 Log on and enter programmer mode. Then use the Cache System 
         Status utility to locate the PID/JOB number of the MailMan 
         listener. The job will be tied to port 25 and will be 
         using the %ZISTCPS routine. It should look similar to the 
         one below. Make note of the Process Number.
  
     Select Systems Manager Menu Option: Programmer Options
     Select Programmer Options Option: Programmer mode
  
     VAH>D ^%SS
  
 Process  Devices    KB Namespace Routine  CPU,Glob  Pri  UIC  
 .
 .
 204102F4 |TCP|1972  52 %SYS  %cmtP    1310,192  4   1,4  
 2041665C |TCP|25    41 DEV   %ZISTCPS 226,35   4 50,62  ? MailMan Listener.

 .
 .
  
  
     1.2 Use the %CD utility and move to the %SYS namespace. Then use 
         the ^RESJOB utility to stop the job.
  
     DEV>D ^%CD
  
     Namespace: %SYS
     You're in namespace %SYS
     Default directory is _$1$DKA200:[CACHESYS.ISC3A6.MGR]
     %SYS>D ^RESJOB
  
     Force a process to quit Cache
  
     Process ID (? for status report): 2041665C
  
     Process ID (? for status report): 
  
     %SYS>D ^%SS (Check again and make sure the XM Listener Job has stopped)
  
     Remember to perform the Steps above on each node that has a MailMan 
     Listener running.
  
  
 5)  In order to have xinetd load the new configurations files, enter 
 the following command at the Linux shell prompt:
  
    /sbin/service xinetd reload
  
 6)  Test mail communication following instructions below.
  
     Telnet to the node and request a connection to a specific port
     The format on a VMS system is TELNET <IP address> <Port#>
  
     ( An Example to the Birmingham OI account at port 25)
     $ TELNET 10.4.21.1 25
  
     (The request is allowed and VistA MailMan Answers)
  
     %TELNET-I-TRYING, Trying ... 10.4.21.1
     %TELNET-I-SESSION, Session 01, host 10.4.21.1, port 25
     220 FO-BIRM.MED.VA.GOV MailMan 8.0 ready
  
     (Type QUIT to drop the connection)
  
     QUIT
  
     221 FO-BIRM.MED.VA.GOV Service closing transmission channel
     %TELNET-S-REMCLOSED, Remote connection closed
     -TELNET-I-SESSION, Session 01, host 10.4.21.1, port 25
  
  
     If the connection test is successful you can try sending mail 
     from another Vista system, such as FORUM, to your system to 
     verify that the service is working.
