Associated patches: (v)ICD*18*50   <<= must be installed BEFORE `ICD*18*53'

Subject: DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  The Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) Grouper is used to compute
  and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
  and any operations/procedures performed. It uses a mixture of 
  formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely 
  on data added to the DRG file (#80.2), the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) 
  and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).  
  These files, the date and the age of the patient determine the codes 
  and other information needed to pass into the formulas and the tables 
  used in those formulas to calculate the DRG. These codes and the DRG 
  codes come from the Federal Register for Center for Medicare and Medicaid
  Services (CMS) and are updated and added to yearly effective 
  October 1 of the year.
 
  This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

  REMEDY OVERVIEW:
  ================
  1) HD0000000411936 - DRG grouper 509 is showing as 232
   
  Problem:
  ========
  Routine ICDDRG0 code had the DRG hard coded to go to DRG 232 which was
  changed to DRG 509 in 2007.
    
  Solution:
  =========
  Changed routine ICDDRG0 to only go to DRG 232 if effective date is less than
  10/1/07.
  
  2) HD0000000445988 - DRG012 displays DRG129 in VistA
  
  Problem:
  ========
  DRG 012 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 129 in Vista.
    
  Solution:
  =========
  Added a look up for procedure code 31.1 in table code routines ICDTBL1B
  and ICDTBL1C to group to the correct DRG.
  
  3) HD0000000447594 - DRG Frequency report is missing the AVERAGE WEIGHT
   
  Problem:
  ========
  Weights of Low, High and Average Length of Stay (ALOS) are assigned to each
  DRG. Users have reported that the DRG Frequency report is not accurate 
  due to weights not being assigned to DRGs.
    
  Solution:
  =========
  Routines ICD1853A and ICD1853B will correct the DRG weights.
  
  4) HD0000000387684 - VISTA is calculating the DRG incorrectly - it 
  should be DRG 585
   
  Problem:
  ========
  DRG calculation for DRG 585 is showing as Ungroupable in Vista. 
     
  Solution:
  =========
  Added identifier for Total Mastectomy to procedure code 85.72. 
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ===========================
  This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
  be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
  Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
   
  1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
      the KIDS distribution included with this message.
      NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
      global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
      need to repeat this step.
   
  2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
   
  3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*53):
      a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
          allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
          is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
          DDs, templates, etc.).
      b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
          allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
          the transport global.
      c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
          components of the KIDS build.
      d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
          message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
          backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
   
  4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*53.
   
  5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
      NO//', respond No.
   
  6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
      Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
   
      When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
      enter:
              PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
      When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
      press enter.
   
  7.  Routine(s) ICD1853* can be deleted after the patch has been
      successfully installed.
   
  8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
      Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] 
      option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the 
      appropriate grouper. This option updates/recalculates the transfer 
      DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal year.
      The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key. The Menu path
      is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
      current FY.
