Subject: DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

   The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute
   and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
   and any operations/procedures performed.  It uses a mixture of 
   formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely 
   on data added to the DRG file (#80.2), the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) 
   and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).  
   These files, the date and the age of the patient determine the codes 
   and other information needed to pass into the formulas and the tables 
   used in those formulas to calculate the DRG.  These codes and the DRG 
   codes come from the Federal Register for Center for Medicare and 
   Medicaid Services (CMS) and are updated and added to yearly effective
   October 1 of the year.
   This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

   REMEDY OVERVIEW:
   ================
   1)HD0000000408859- DRG 003/004 and 283/284 discrepancies
    
   Problem:
   ========
   DRG 004 was incorrectly calculating to DRG 003 in VistA but was corrected
   in a previous patch.
 
   DRG 284 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 283 in VistA. The diagnosis codes
   are not accounting for an "expired" patient. 
     
   Solution:
   =========
   Routines ICDTBL2B and ICDTBL2C were modified to account for an "expired"
   patient when using diagnosis codes 427.41 and 427.5. 
   
   2) HD0000000423420- INCORRECT DRG 253 (VISTA 292)
   
   Problem:
   ========
   DRG 253 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 292 in VistA.
     
   Solution:
   =========
   Routines ICDTBL2B and ICDTBL2C were modified to look for identifier K.
   
   3) HD0000000447283- 5 groups of codes are not coming up with correct DRG
    
   Problem:
   ========
   Five different groups of codes are calculating to incorrect DRGs; however,
   two group of codes were corrected in a previous patch.
 
   The following are being corrected by this patch:
    a. DRG 867 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 862 in VistA.
    b. DRG 456 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 490 in VistA.
    c. DRG 261 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 310 in VistA.
     
   Solution:
   =========
    a. Routines ICDTBL8B and ICDTBL8C were modified to group codes to the
       correct DRG. 
    b. Routine ICDTBL4 was modified to check for correct identifiers.
    c. Identifier 7 was added to procedure code 37.76.
   
   4) HD0000000454115- DRG configured in Quantim-983. Incorrect DRG crossed 
                       into VIP workplace as 982. Incorrect DRG in VistA 982
                       discrepancies on a PTF
   Problem:
   ========
   DRG 983 is incorrectly calculating to DRG 982 in VistA. 
      
   Solution:
   =========
   Routines ICDTBL9B and ICDTBL9C were modified to verify that diagnosis code 
   278.01 and secondary diagnosis code v85.43 group to DRG 983. 
  
   5)HD0000000445923- DRG config.discrepancies on a PTF - 308 crossed 
                      over as 310
  
   Problem:
   ========
   DRG 308 and DRG 309 are incorrectly calculating to DRG 310 in VistA. 
  
   Solution:
   =========
   Routines ICDTBL3B and ICDTBL3C were modified to check for a patient that
   hasn't been "expired".
  
  
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===========================
   This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
   be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
   Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
       NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
       global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
       need to repeat this step.
    
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*54):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       ICD*18.0*54.
    
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       YES//', respond NO.
    
   6.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
    
       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
       enter:
               PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
       When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
       Order':', press enter.
    
   7.  Routine(s) ICD1854* can be deleted after the patch has been
       successfully installed.
    
   8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
       [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] option in order to make the transfer
       DRGs correspond to the appropriate grouper.  This option 
       updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF records opened during
       the current fiscal year.
       The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
       is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
       current FY.
