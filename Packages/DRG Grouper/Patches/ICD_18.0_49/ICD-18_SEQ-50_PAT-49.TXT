Subject: DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute
 and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
 and any operations/procedures performed.  It uses a mixture of 
 formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely 
 on data added to the DRG file (#80.2), the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) 
 and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).  
 These files, the date and the age of the patient determine the codes 
 and other information needed to pass into the formulas and the tables 
 used in those formulas to calculate the DRG.  These codes and the DRG 
 codes come from the Federal Register for Center for Medicare and Medicaid
 Services (CMS) and are updated and added to the yearly effective 
 October 1 of the year.
  
 This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
    
 1) HD0000000382253 - Incorrectly calculated DRGs
    
  Problem:
  ========
  Vista is incorrectly calculating some Cancer DRGs.
   
  Solution:
  =========
  Changed table routine ICDTBL8A,ICDTBL8B and ICDTBL8C 
  to better identify Cancer DRGS.  
  
 2) HD0000000445532 - Transfer DRG option error-<NOLINE>DODRG+8^ICDDRG0
  
  Problem:
  ========
  Vista is receiving an error when codes group directly to DRG 15.
   
  Solution:
  =========
  Added a line to ICDTBL0C to group correctly to DRG 15.
  
 3) HD0000000421009 - DRG 659.61 issue
  
  Problem:
  ========
  Diagnosis code 659.61 shows as ungroupable.
   
  Solution:
  =========
  Added identifier to Diagnosis code 659.61 to make code 
  group correctly. Post install routine ICD1849L will make the update.
  
 4) HD0000000411886 - DRG config.discrepancies on a PTF. Correct DRG 
  
  Problem:
  ========
  DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 620 instead of 621.
   
  Solution:
  =========
  Changed table routine ICDTBL6B and ICDTBL6C to look for operation 
  identifier to point to the correct DRG code.  
  
 5) HD0000000406110 - DRG was 244 Quantim screen but 259 on mapping screen
  
  Problem:
  ========
  DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 259 instead of 244.
   
  Solution:
  =========
  Changed table routine ICDTBL2B and ICDTBL2C to look for operation 
  identifier to point to the correct DRG code.  
  
 6) HD0000000392058 - DRG not Matching from QUANTIM to VISTA 513/506 and 827/829
  
  Problem:
  ========
  DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 829 instead of 847.
  DRG calculating incorrectly in Vista as 506 instead of 513.
  
  Solution:
  =========
  Corrected some Cancer groupings in ICDTBL8B and ICDTBL8C.
  Changed table routine ICDTBL5B and ICDTBL5C to look for operation 
  identifier to point to the correct DRG code.  
   
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
 ===========================
 This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
 be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
 Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
  
 1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
     the KIDS distribution included with this message.
     NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport global
            will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
            need to repeat this step.
  
 2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
     the Installation menu.
  
 3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
     (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*49):
     a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
         allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
         is installed.  It compares all components of the patch (routines,
         DDs, templates, etc.).
     b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
         allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
         the transport global.
     c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
         components of the KIDS build.
     d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
         message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
         backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package ICD*18.0*49.
  
 5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
     NO//', respond No.
  
 6.  When prompted,'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and 
     Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
  
     When prompted,'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
     enter:
             PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
     When prompted,'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':', 
     press enter.
  
 7.  Routines ICD1849* can be deleted after the patch has been
     successfully installed.
  
 8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
     Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] 
     option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the 
     appropriate grouper. This option updates/recalculates the transfer 
     DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal year.
     The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
     is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
     Current FY.
