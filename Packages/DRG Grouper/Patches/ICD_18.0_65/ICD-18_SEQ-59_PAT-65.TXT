    FY 2013 International Classification of Diseases (ICD)/DRG Update
    and is the follow up to patch LEX*2.0*84.

     All page references below are for this issue and resource documents 
     can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/.
  
     Note: For FY2013 there are no new, revised, or deleted diagnosis 
           codes and no revised or deleted procedure codes that are usually
           announced in Tables 6A (New Diagnosis Codes), 6C (Invalid 
           Diagnosis Codes), 6D (Invalid Procedure Codes), 6E (Revised
           Diagnosis Code Titles), and 6F (Revised Procedure Codes).  
      
  Changes include:
      
     I.   Revised DRGs.
      
     II.  Revised DRG relative weights & average length of stay (ALOS)
          values for all DRGs.
  
     III. DRG reclassification changes to the Grouper.
    
      
  This is a summary of the additions/changes made:
      
     I.   Routine ICD1865A was written to update the DRG file (#80.2).
  
     II.  Routine ICD1865A is also used to update the finalized values for 
          DRG relative weights and average length of stay (ALOS).
  
          Additional DRG-related values were taken from this Table:
      
                Table 6B for 1 new procedure code     
      
     Routine ICD1865C incorporated these values in the following fields of
     ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1):
       IDENTIFIER (#2) as needed
       DRG GROUPER EFFECTIVE DATE (#71) and its sub-files
  
     Routines ICDDRG0 and ICDTBL0E-9E were added/modified to complete
     the proper grouping of the existing diagnosis codes and new 
     procedure code.
       
     III. DRG RECLASSIFICATION.

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  ==========================
   NOTE: Please do not forget to do step 6. This is a very important step 
   as it updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for Patient Treatment 
   File (PTF) records opened during the current fiscal year.
    
   This patch can be loaded with users on the system.  However, it would 
   be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
       
   Install Time - 5 to 10 minutes.
       
      
   This patch does not involve global file restoration. Nonetheless, we
   suggest you create global saves on files #80 (^ICD9), #80.1 (^ICD0) and
   #80.2 (^ICD) in the event problems develop during the install.  If it
   became necessary to use the saved files, you should first kill all the
   records (except the zero node) before applying the global restores.
       
   1. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
       
   2. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
      (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*65)
          a.  Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
              message of any routines exported with the patch.  It will NOT
              backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
          b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
              allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
              is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
              (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
          c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
              allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
              the transport global. 
          d.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view
              the components of the KIDS build.
       
   3. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
      ICD*18.0*65.
       
   4. When prompted, 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install? 
      NO//', respond NO
       
   5. When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
      and Protocols? YES//', respond YES.
      
      When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
      enter:
             PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU]
   
      When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of
      Order':', press enter.
   
   6. Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
      Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs] 
      option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the appropriate 
      grouper.  This option updates/recalculates the transfer DRGs for PTF 
      records opened during the current fiscal year. The option is locked 
      with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path is PTF Menu/Update DRG 
      Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for current FY.
       
   7. All routines beginning with ICD1865* can be deleted after the patch
      has been successfully installed.
