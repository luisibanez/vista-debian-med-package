Subject: DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

   The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute
   and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
   and any operations/procedures performed.  It uses a mixture of 
   formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely 
   on data added to the DRG file (#80.2), the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) 
   and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1). These files, 
   the date, and the age of the patient determine which codes are 
   needed to calculate the proper DRG.
  
   This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

   a)Modified routine ICDTBL1C to account for DRG 205 and DRG 206 as well.
   b)Modified routine ICDTBL5C to account for identifier "U".
   
   
   3)HD0000000431141 - Quadramed DRGs not matching Vista DRGs
   
   Problem:
   ========
   There are twenty three total issues listed in the ticket; however, 
   the majority of the issues have either been corrected by a previous

   a)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 292 instead of 293.
   b)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 408 instead of 411.
   c)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 062 instead of 069.
   d)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 458 instead of 491.
    
   Solution:
   =========
   a)Modified necessary routines to account for identifier "Z".
   b)Added identifier "T" to procedure codes 51.21, 51.22, 51.23, 
     and 51.24.
   c)Modified necessary routines to account for DRG 69 as well.
   d)Removed identifier "6" from diagnosis code 730.28.
  
   
   4)HD0000000465665 - 584.9 is MCC and should be CC for 2011
  
   Problem:
   ========
   There are five total issues listed in the ticket; however, two of
   the issues have been corrected by a previous patch. The following
   are being corrected in this patch:
   a)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 825 instead of 822.
   b)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 623 instead of 617.
   c)DRG calculating incorrectly in VistA as 023 instead of 027. 
  
   Solution:
   =========
   a)Added identifiers 2, 3, and "O" to procedure code 07.83.  
   b)Modified routine ICDTBL6C to account for identifier "A" and
     added identifier "A" to procedure codes 84.10 through 84.17.

   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
   ===========================
   This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
   be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
   Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
    
   1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
       the KIDS distribution included with this message.
       NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
       global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
       need to repeat this step.
    
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
    
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
       (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*55):
       a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
           allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
           is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
           (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
       b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
           allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
           the transport global.
       c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
           components of the KIDS build.
       d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
           backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
    
   4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
       ICD*18.0*55.
    
   5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//', respond No.
    
   6.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
       Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
    
       When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
       enter:
               PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
       When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
       Order':', press enter.
    
   7.  Routine(s) ICD1855* can be deleted after the patch has been
       successfully installed.
    
   8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
       Update Transfer DRGs for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs]
       option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the 
       appropriate grouper. This option updates/recalculates the transfer
       DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal year. The 
       option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key. The Menu path is
       PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for 
       current FY.
