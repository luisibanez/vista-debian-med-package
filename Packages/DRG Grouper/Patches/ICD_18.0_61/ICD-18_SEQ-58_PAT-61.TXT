Subject: DRG GROUPER FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

    The DRG (Diagnostic Related Group) Grouper is used to compute
    and display the DRG for a patient based on that patient's diagnoses
    and any operations/procedures performed.  It uses a mixture of 
    formulas, Diagnosis and Operation identifiers, and tables that rely 
    on data added to the DRG file (#80.2), the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) 
    and the ICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file (#80.1).  These files, 
    the date, and the age of the patient determine which codes are 
    needed to calculate the proper DRG.
  
    This patch corrects various DRG calculations.

    INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    ===========================
    This patch may be run with users on the system.  However, it would
    be preferable if Medical Records coders were off the system.
    Installation will take less than 5 minutes.
     
    1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu to unload
        the KIDS distribution included with this message.
        NOTE:  If the required patches are not installed, the transport 
        global will be removed.  If the transport global is removed you will
        need to repeat this step.
     
    2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
        the Installation menu.
     
    3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
        (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ICD*18.0*61):
        a.  Compare Transport Global to Current System  - this option will
            allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
            is installed.  It compares all components of the patch 
            (routines, DDs, templates, etc.).
        b.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will
            allow you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in
            the transport global.
        c.  Print Transport Global - this option will allow you to view the
            components of the KIDS build.
        d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
            message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
            backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
     
    4.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package 
        ICD*18.0*61.
     
    5.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
        NO//', respond NO.
     
    6.  When prompted, 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
        Protocols? YES//', respond Yes.
     
        When prompted, 'Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order':',
        enter:
                PTF Menu  [DG PTF MENU] 
        When prompted, 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of 
        Order':', press enter.
     
    7.  Routine(s) ICD1861* can be deleted after the patch has been
        successfully installed.
     
    8.  Following installation of this patch, it is necessary to run the
        Update Transfer DRG's for Current FY [DG PTF UPDATE TRANSFER DRGs]
        option in order to make the transfer DRGs correspond to the
        appropriate grouper.  This option updates/recalculates the transfer
        DRGs for PTF records opened during the current fiscal year.
        The option is locked with the DG PTFSUP security key.  The Menu path
        is PTF Menu/Update DRG Information Menu/Update Transfer DRGs for
        current FY.
