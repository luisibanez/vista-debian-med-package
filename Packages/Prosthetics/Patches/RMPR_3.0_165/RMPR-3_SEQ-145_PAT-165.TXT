Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Home Oxygen charges for a patient do not total for all linked Fund  
    Control Points.                                              
                                        
 2. The VistA National Prosthetic Patient Database (NPPD) reporting
    does not match the national NPPD rollup for Unique Social
    Security Number (SSN) totals between NEW item costs and USED   
    inventory item costs.
     
 3. Delete Prosthetics options Manual Send Delivery Notification and  
    Returned Delivery Verification Card and remove same options from
    Prosthetics Utilities Menu as the government contract for Letter 
    Notification was cancelled.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) HD0000000458301 Home Oxygen charges for patients are not splitting
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When reviewing/editing Home Oxygen transactions for a patient, the FCP totals
 only accrue for Fund Control Point (FCP) 910 and not new FCPs created 
 over the years for Prosthetic Home Oxygen billing.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPOBIL2 to accumulate dollars for all FCPs used in Home
 Oxygen transactions and display individual FCP totals on screen.
  
 Routines: RMPOBIL2
  
  
  
 2) HD0000000470618 Prosthetic NPPD Unique SSN totals discrepancy
  
 Problem:
 --------         
 Staff noticed that the VistA NPPD Worksheet reporting had Unique SSN
 totals that differed from the national NPPD rollup totals for Unique SSN.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modified the NPPD Worksheet compile routine to recognize NEW items 
 from USED items to enable accurate reporting and totals for each type
 of report.
  
 Routines: RMPRN6
  
  
 3) HD0000000463428 Delete Delivery Notification options
  
 Problem:
 --------
 As a response to Patient Letter Notification error resolution,
 it was noted by Prosthetics staff that this program was cancelled
 by the government.
  
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The following options will be deleted:
  
            MS     Manual Send Delivery Notification
            RD     Returned Delivery Verification Card
