 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) INC000000771473  Update RMPR* routines to reflect New Privacy Act Sta
                     Modify routines RMPRP23, RMPR9P23, and RMPR4P23
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Per Acquisition Policy Flash 12-04, Prosthetics routines need to be
 updated to reflect the New Privacy Act Statement 
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update Prosthetics routines used to display the Privacy Act Statement to 
 use the newly released text.
  
 Routines: RMPR9P23, RMPRP23, RMPR4P23
   
 2) INC000000786903  The home oxygen billing package - RMPO Billing 
                     Transactions  
  
 Problem: 
 --------
 Sites are unable to post prosthetics monthly home oxygen bills to
 the 1358 DAILY RECORD file (#424) when Veterans internal entry numbers
 (IEN) in the Patient file (#2) exceed 9 digits. These issues occur due to
 length restrictions in the 1358 DAILY RECORD file (#424) REFERENCE field
 (#.1) when the IEN's are concatenated with the identifier string "PAT ID"
 and exceed maximum amount of characters for that field.
    
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the identifier string to be "PID" thereby reducing the number 
 of characters by three which will allow the record to post correctly.
