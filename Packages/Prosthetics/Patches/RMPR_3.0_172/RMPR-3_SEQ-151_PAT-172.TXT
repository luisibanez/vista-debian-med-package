 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) INC0000000856959 National HCPCS updates not updating description 
                     properly
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When national updates are released to sites for Prosthetics HCPCS codes, 
 the description field will not update correctly if the new description 
 contains fewer lines than the previous description.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the system server processing to ensure 
 the old description is fully deleted BEFORE the new HCPCS description is 
 added in the PROSTHETICS HCPCS file (#661.1).
