 3) HD0000000518673 Prosthetics GUI error when displaying Delayed Order 
                    Report (DOR), <UNDEFINED>DTFWD+18^RMPR9DO
  
 Problem:
 -------
 User have tried to display the DOR report via the GUI Prosthetics package 
 and received the following error, <UNDEFINED>DTFWD+18^RMPR9DO.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 There are extraneous 'L' and 'L1' cross references remaining in the 
 PROSTHETIC SUSPENSE file (#668) that typically occur. When the patient
 Social Security number is modified in the patient record and not handled
 through any interface to correct the same patient Suspense Records cross
 references.
  
 Modified routine RMPR9DO to bypass any 'L' or 'L1' cross references that 
 are no longer linked to defined the master suspense record.
  
 Modified routine RMPR8PG to call new routine RMPR8PG1 that will provide 
 an audit/cleanup of the 'L' and 'L1' cross references at the end of the 
 option Purge Suspense Records. 
  
 Also, wrote post install routine to remove the extraneous 'L' and 'L1' 
 cross references due to not matching linked master record or linked 
 master record no longer exists.
  
 Routines:  RMPR9DO, RMPR8PG, RMPR8PG1, RMPR163P (post install)
