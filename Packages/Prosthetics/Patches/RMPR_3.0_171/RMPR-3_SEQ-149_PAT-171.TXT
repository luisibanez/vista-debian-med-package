 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) HD0000000723319 Cannot link patient record to Suspense
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User may get false message '>> NO patient unlinked items available
 to be posted to Suspense, hit return' when using the option "Link 
 Patient Record to Suspense". 
  
 The false message is caused by some 2319 entries having null file
 node 10 suspense information.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modifications have been made to the system to improve the suspense
 linking process by considering a null 2319 suspense node as unlinked
 item and display such items for linking to suspense.
