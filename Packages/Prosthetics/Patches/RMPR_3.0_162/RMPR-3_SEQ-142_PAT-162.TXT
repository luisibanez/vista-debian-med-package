Subject: SUSPENSE PROCESSING, 2319 VIEW;HCPCS CALC FLAG - DISPLAY 2319

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1. When using the "23 Display 2319" option, if a user decides to exit 
    using the up caret (^) symbol at the Enter 10-2319 screen to VIEW
    prompt, they will receive a system error.
  
 2. When a user in the Prosthetics application views the Display/Print 
    Display 2319 menu option, HCPCS items and shipping charges are not
    being displayed correctly.

 Remedy Overview:
 ============ 
 1) HD0000000343250 Error - <UNDEFINED>WRI+1^RMPRPAT
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 An Error is being received in Suspense processing when using template
 action 23 Display 2319 and attempting to use the up caret (^) function
 at the MAS Disability Codes prompt and then again at view type causes an
 undefined error to occur.
  
 Also, found that view types (1-8) are not listed when entering action the 
 first time, but only on subsequent return to view types.
  
 In addition, found that view types (1-8) should be (1-7) when only 
 listing 7 view types (HOME OXYGEN ITEMS only for Display/Print Patient 
 2319).
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPRPAT to list view types (1-8) on the initial entry into 
 action [23 Display 2319] and RMPRPAT1 to handle up arrow entry when 
 listing MAS Disability Codes in FOR loop.
  
 Routines: RMPRPAT, RMPRPAT1
  
  
 2) HD0000000349208 - HCPCS calc flag and shipping charge added together 
                      on 2319 display.                 
          
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A site discovered a problem when displaying a 2319 for a Prosthetics order
 with an item having a calc flag HCPCS code and a shipping charge. The item
 summary (due to the calc flag) will roll up the shipping charge.
  
 Analysis found that calc flag rollup will not function properly when 
 multiple calc flag items are included in order.  Sites were previously 
 advised to create a separate order for each calc flagged item, but code 
 should be able to handle item rollup for order with multiple calc flagged 
 items.
  
 Display of shipping charge does not show any description at all.
  
 Detail view of rolled up calc flagged item displays entire order, not 
 just the detail of item and components within rollup.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Corrected the problem when displaying a 2319 Prosthetics order with an
 item having a calc flag HCPCS code.  The system will no longer roll up
 shipping charge into the item summary (due to the calc flag).
  
 Modified the system so the calc flag rollup will now function properly 
 when multiple calc flag items are included in an order.   Sites were 
 previously advised to create a separate order for each calc flagged item, 
 but logic was modified to handle order for site that include multiple 
 calc flagged items in same order.
  
  
 Modified display logic for shipping charge detail to show description of 
 'SHIPPING CHARGE'.
  
 Also, modified detail view of rolled up calc flagged item to ONLY display 
 components of rollup, NOT entire order.
