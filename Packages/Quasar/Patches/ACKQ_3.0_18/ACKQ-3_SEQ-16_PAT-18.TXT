Subject: UPDATE FOR UNSUPPORTED ICD/CPT FIELDS

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issue:
  
 Code Set Versioning patch LEX*2.0*25 and ICD*18*6 added APIs and Multiples
 to the following files - ICD DIAGNOSIS (#80) and CPT MODIFIER (#81.3) for
 collection and use of yearly information. During this enhancement, support
 for some older fields were also discontinued. This patch will use the
 correct API's in order to get the correct information for Quasar.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 HD0000000370699 UPDATE FOR UNSUPPORTED ICD/CPT FIELDS 
    
    Problem:   
    --------
    A) The first issue has to do with the INACTIVE FLAG field (#5) in
    the CPT MODIFIER file (#81.3). This field is not supported and 
    needs to be replaced in order for the software to function properly.
  
    B) The second issue concerns the ICD DIAGNOSIS file (#80) and the
    DIAGNOSIS (#3) field that is also not supported. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A) For the first issue changes were made to routine ACKQNQ and it is now
    using API $$MOD^ICPTMOD in order for the software to function properly.  
  
    B) For the second issue routine ACKQUTL5 was modified and now calls API
    $$ICDDX^ICDCODE which will allow the program to pull the correct 
    information.
