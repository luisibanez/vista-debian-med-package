Description:
============

  This patch fixes two problems reported after the installation of patch 
  LEX*2.0*73, one problem discovered while performing the analysis for 
  the solution of the reported problems and one "housekeeping" fix
  to a grammatical error discovered during development.
    
  1)  Incomplete AWRD cross-reference.
    
      This problem is directly attributed to patch LEX*2.0*73.  The AWRD
      cross-reference will be re-built during the installation of this patch.
      Only the Set logic of the cross-reference will be executed.  This
      will allow users to remain on the system during both the install and
      during the rebuilding of the cross-reference.  (Remedy Tickets 502655,
      503574, 505562, 505567, 505719, 506920, 508352, and 509775)
    
      Additionally, this patch exports a utility designed primarily for
      the Lexicon developers so they can quickly fix a site without
      kicking users off the system.  Without this utility, it would take
      between 4 - 5 hours to re-index the Lexicon files.  Users, coders,
      and providers would be effectively without a Lexicon during that 
      time.  With this utility, users may remain on the system.  Unlike 
      FileMan, the utility does not delete the entire cross-reference.
      Instead, each cross-reference node is inspected and every subscript
      is evaluated.  If one or more subscript fails verification, then only
      that node is deleted.  The remainder of the cross-reference
      remains intact, allowing users to be on the system at the time the 
      cross-references are repaired.  The utility moves away from the old
      "delete and set" method to "repair" approach.  This utility runs in
      the background (TaskMan).

  2)  ICD Codes do not appear on the selection list
       
      Patch LEX*2.0*73 did not create this problem, but it did make it 
      observable and reportable.  This problem has gone undetected since
      September 24, 2003.  The missing ICD codes occurred so far down on 
      the selection list that users did not scroll down far enough to 
      observe the problem.  With the incomplete AWRD cross-reference, the 
      missing ICD codes occurred closer to the top of the selection list
      (no scrolling required) and was observed and reported by several users
      at multiple sites.
       
      As it turns out, those terms without codes should never have been added
      onto the selection list when screening for ICD codes.  The problem 
      resides in the routine LEXSRC, tag line ONE, where it extracts a single
      source code for a term.  The routine identifies the code 250.00 as an 
      active code but fails to identify the code as being inactivated for 
      the term "Diabetes Mellitus Type II or unspecified"  (IEN 33605).  The 
      code really is active, just not for that term, so the term should never
      have been placed on the selection list.  Later, when the list is 
      presented to the user for selection, it uses another API to get the 
      code ($$SO^LEXASO).  In this API, the logic is correct and the code is
      identified as inactive for the term and the code is NOT displayed.
      So you have a term added to the list without a code.  
    
         Before
    
                Enter Term/Concept:  DIABETES

                NOTE:  The first entry (the term without the code)
                       should not be on the list
                        
         After       
                   
                Enter Term/Concept:  DIABETES
                    
                81 matches found

                   3   Pregnancy in Diabetes (ICD-9-CM 648.00)
                   4   Diabetes, Gestational * (ICD-9-CM 648.80)
                   5   Polyneuropathy in diabetes (ICD-9-CM 357.2)
               
                NOTE:  The list is shorter (only 81 entries) since
                       the terms without ICD codes are not included
                       in the list.
    
  3)  Typographical error in Data Dictionary Cross-Reference Set Logic
    
      This problem has gone undetected by the sites.  The only way to 
      observe the problem is to have re-indexed the Lexicon (a 4-5 hour
      task).  Since no site has done that, the problem remained unreported.
      It was discovered while developing a solution to the incomplete AWRD
      cross-reference (#1 above).   This affects:
    
        File:    CODES                   #757.01
        Field:   CLASSIFICATION SOURCE   #2
        Index:   AVA
        Source:  BI-RADS  Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Sys
                 DSM-IV   Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
    
      The typo will be fixed and the "AVA" cross-reference rebuilt (about 
      25-40 seconds).
    
  4)  Grammatical error in prompt while editing user defaults
   
      This problem was discovered during the development of this patch and
      has gone undetected since the Lexicon's initial release September 23,
      1996. (routine LEXDM)
   
        Prompt changed from:  Display format to used during look-up
        to:                   Display format to be used during look-up

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
      
    1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*81.
        It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
        hours.  This patch should take from 4 - 5 minutes to install
        depending on the system.  The install time is short because 
        the work of repairing the AWRD/AVA cross-references is performed
        in the background by TaskMan.
      
    2)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
      
    3)  Distribution Load:
    
        Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
        Packman function "Install/Check Message."
    
    4)  KIDS Installation:
    
        Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
        "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*81.
    
          Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
          the install?" prompt.
    
          Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
          Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
    
        The KIDs install should take from 2-4 minutes.
      
    5)  Cleanup
      
        Upon completion of the installation, the following routines may be
        deleted from your system using the KERNEL option 'Delete Routines'
        [XTRDEL]:
 
             LEX2081     Environment Check routine
             LEX2081P    Post-Install routine
        
        NOTE:  Do NOT delete the routine LEX2081A  
 
               This routine should be running in the background, re-indexing
               selected cross-references in the Lexicon.
