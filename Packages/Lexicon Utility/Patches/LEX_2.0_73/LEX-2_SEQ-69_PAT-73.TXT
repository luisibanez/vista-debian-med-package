Description:
============

  This patch contains an update to Title 38 Disabilities Codes, one Code
  Set API fix, fixes for 12 Remedy Tickets and a fix for one Patient Safety
  finding.
  
  
  Title 38 CFR
  
      This patch updates the codes taken from Title 38 of the Code of Federal
      Regulations, Pensions, Bonuses, and Veterans' Relief, Chapter 1 
      Department of Veterans Affairs, Part 4 Schedule for Rating Disabilities,
      Subpart B Schedule for Rating Disabilities, Appendix B Numerical Index 
      of Disabilities (here after referred to as Title 38).  Also included is
      a mapping between Title 38 diagnosis and ICD-9 diagnosis.
  
  Title 38/ICD-9 Mapping
  
      This patch provides a map between the Title 38 Disability Codes and the
      ICD-9-CM Diagnosis codes.  This mapping is contained in two new files;
      the MAPPING DEFINITIONS file #757.32 and the MAPPINGS file #757.33.
      The purpose of these files is to map a Title 38 Disability Code to an
      ICD-9 Diagnosis code and determine if the map is an exact match or a 
      partial match.
  
  $$STATCHK^LEXSRC2
   
      A problem with this API was discovered when updating the Title 38 codes
      for the Automated Service Connected Designation (ASCD) project.  It was
      discovered that some of these codes were also found in other 
      classification systems.  This is a problem when trying to establish the
      activation status for a code, and the code is 'Active' for one coding 
      system but 'Inactive' for another.   Example
  
         Code 6206
  
           Status     Coding System           Term
           --------   ---------------------   ---------------------------
           Inactive   Title 38 Disabilities   Mastoiditis
           Active     DoD DMIS ID             Navy NAVCARE Clinic Mayport
  
      To fix the problem, changes were made to the following routines:  
      LEXABC, LEXAR5, LEXASO, LEXCODE, LEXNDX8, LEXSRC, LEXSRC2, LEXU, 
      and LEXXFQ.
  
      NOTE:  A scan was conducted of the Lexicon and it was determined that
             this problem is limited to Title 38 Codes.
  
  Lexicon Lookup Help Text - Patient Safety 1575, Remedy 351846 and 395459
  
      This patch provides online help to the users informing them that by 
      entering a "+  sign after the search code, they will be presented with
      all terms for that code, not just the term provided by the Standards 
      Development Organization.  Routines changed include LEXA, LEXA1, LEXAR3
      and LEXAR7.  The following help text is displayed:
  
              Enter a "free text" term.  Best results occur using one to 
              three full or partial words without a suffix (i.e., "DIABETES",
              "DIAB MELL","DIAB MELL INSUL")
          or  
              Enter a classification code (ICD/CPT etc) to find the single 
              term associated with the code.  Example, a lookup of code 239.0 
              returns one and only one term, that is the preferred 
              term for the code 239.0, "Neoplasm of unspecified nature 
              of digestive system"
          or  
              Enter a classification code (ICD/CPT etc) followed by a plus
              sign (+) to retrieve all terms associated with the code. 
              Example, a lookup of 239.0+ returns all terms that are linked 
              to the code 239.0.
  
  Discontinue the use of Direct Global Reads of file 80
  
      This patch replaces all direct global reads of file 80 in the Lexicon
      namespace (allowed by IA 4485) to comply with Code Set Versioning.  This
      allows file 80 to be independent of the Lexicon software.  Routines 
      changed include LEXLGM3, LEXPL, LEXPLEM, LEXPLIA, LEXPLUP, LEXQID, 
      LEXQID2, LEXQID3, LEXQIP, LEXQIP3 and LEXXFQ.
  
  Modified the Recording of Protocols
  
      The recording of Protocols was switched from file number to utilize 
      the source abbreviations.  This opens the protocol up for use by other 
      packages and classification systems.  The current Protocol only responds
      to ICD and CPT updates, but this change will allow it to respond to 
      updates to Snomed CT or ICD-10 (future expected requirement).  Routines
      changed include LEXXFI, LEXXGI, LEXXGI2 and LEXXII.  Protocols modified
      include:
  
          LEXICAL SERVICES UPDATE 
          ICD CODE UPDATE EVENT      (LEX/ICD ICR #4486)
          ICPT CODE UPDATE EVENT     (LEX/CPT ICR #4489)
  
  Support for "G" Cross-Reference in the MAPPINGS file 757.33
  
      MUMPS code is provided that sets and kills the "G" Cross-Reference
      of both the EFFECTIVE DATE (.01) and STATUS (1) fields of the STATUS 
      HISTORY sub-file 757.333 in the MAPPINGS file #757.33.  This code is
      contained in routine LEXNDX9.
  
  Parsing Text Containing an apostrophe "S"
  
      A logic error was discovered while parsing text containing words with
      an apostrophe "S" that also ended in "S" or words with ending in a
      double "SS".  The parsing logic routine stripped off too many "S"s.
      This has been fixed in routine LEXTOLKN.
  
  Remedy Tickets
  
      351846    Wrong Diagnosis in CPRS (PSPO #1575)
      395459    Help Text added to retrieve correct description for 477.9

  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  =========================
  
      1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*73.
          It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
          hours.  This patch should take from 32 to 64 minutes to install
          depending on the system.
  
              Create a backup    30-60 minutes
              Kids Install        2-4  minutes
  
      2)  Create a backup of the following global before continuing:
  
              Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
  
          This backup files may get as large as 1.16 gigabytes.  Make sure
          space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 30 to
          60 minutes to create the backup files.
  
          When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
          saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
          non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
          the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
          number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
  
              Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
              ------           --------------------------
              ^LEX             Lexicon Files
  
      3)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
      4)  Distribution Load:
  
          Load the KIDS Distribution from the KIDS Host File using the 
          "Load a Distribution" option on the KIDS "Installation..." menu.
          Use Host File name LEX_2_73.KID.
  
          Respond "YES" at the "OK to continue with Load? NO//" prompt.
  
          Respond "YES" at the "Want to RUN the Environment Check 
          Routine? YES//" prompt
  
      5)  KIDS Installation:
  
          Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
          "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*73.
  
            Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
            the install?" prompt.
  
            Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
            Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
          The KIDs install should take from 2-4 minutes
  
      6)  Cleanup
  
          a)  The following routines in the LEX2073* namespace should be 
              deleted using the KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL]
              upon completion of the installation.

                  LEX2073P
  
              NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                     update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                     the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                     do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                     complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                     Post-Install routines.
