     The preferred method is to FTP the files from download.vista.domain.ext,
     which will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
  
     The files may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
     location at the following locations.
  
          Hines           ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext
          Albany          ftp.fo-albany.domain.ext
          Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext
  
          Files are available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
  
   INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   =========================
  
      1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*93.
          It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
          hours.  This patch should take from 24 to 57 minutes to install
          depending on the system.
  
              Create a backup    20 - 47 minutes
              Load the Global    .5 -  3 minutes
              Kids Install        3 -  7 minutes
              Total              24 - 57 minutes
  
      2)  Create a backup of the following global files before continuing:
  
              ICD Operation/Procedures     #80.1       ^ICD0(
              CPT/HCPCS Procedure          #81         ^ICPT(
              CPT Modifier                 #81.3       ^DIC(81.3,
              Lexicon Files             #757-757.41    ^LEX(
  
          These backup files may get as large as 1.2 gigabytes.  Make sure
          space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 20 to
          47 minutes to create the backup files.
  
          Before you begin backing up the data in the ^LEX global, first 
          clear out the UNRESOLVED NARRATIVE file 757.06.  This will 
          prevent the backup procedure from encountering a control character
          and aborting in error.  At the programmer prompt, issue the 
          following MUMPS command to remove the control characters:
  
             >D CLR^LEXAR7 
  
          When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
          saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
          non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
          the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
          number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
  
              Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
              ------           --------------------------
              ^ICD0            ICD Operation/Procedures
              ^ICPT            CPT/HCPCS Procedure
              ^LEX             Lexicon Files
 
          When you are creating a backup of a subscripted global, you are
          saving a partial global (a file within a global).  You should use
          the utility ^%GOGEN, and when prompted for a global, enter the open
          global reference (as shown below).  Examples:
  
              Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
              ------           --------------------------
              ^DIC(81.3,       CPT Modifier
  
      3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_93.GBL.  This
          file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
          This global is approximately 12 megabytes in size.  Make sure
          there is sufficient space available to load this global with
          journaling on.  The loading of the global should take from 
          .5 to 3 minutes.
  
            From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
  
              >D ^%GI
              
              Global input
              
              Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_93.GBL
              Parameters? "RS" => 
              Globals were saved on 18 Sep 2013  10:02 AM   Cache
              with description: LEX*2.0*93/ICD*18.0*73/ICPT*6.0*65 Data
              
              Input option: A
              ^LEXM
 
 
      4)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
      5)  Distribution Load:
  
          Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
          Packman function "Install/Check Message."
  
      6)  KIDS Installation:
  
          Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
          "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*93.
  
            Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
            the install?" prompt.
  
            Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
            Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
          The KIDs install should take from 3 to 7 minutes
  
      7)  Cleanup
  
          a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2093 and the Post-Install 
              routines LEX2093P and LEX2093A should be deleted using the 
              KERNEL option 'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion 
              of the installation.
  
              NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                     update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                     the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                     do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                     complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                     Post-Install routines.
