Description:
============

  
  This patch creates the subset of SNOMED CT (Systemized Nomenclature of 
  Medicine Clinical Terms) that will be used by the Problem List
  Standardization project as the standard for the Problem List application.
  The patch also populates the Mappings file (#757.33) which holds the
  mappings between the SNOMED CT codes that are members of the Problem List
  subset and ICD-9-CM (Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
  Modification) codes, and an API (Application Programming Interface) to
  retrieve those mappings.
  
  This patch transports the data, data dictionaries and new APIs required
  to support the Problem List Standardization project.
  
  This patch exports data for the following files:

 Enhancements
 ============
  
    
   Two new subsets have been defined in the subset definitions file 
   (#757.2) and populated in the subsets file (#757.21).
  
     1. Problem List Standard (PLS)
        This contains those elements of SNOMED CT that were identified by
        VA subject matter experts, in consultation with external partners,
        as properly belonging to the 'Standard Problem List'. The original
        VA (Veterans Affairs) / KP (Kaiser Permanente) list has been
        augmented by VA subject matter experts.
  
     2. Clinical Findings (CLF)
        This subset contains those elements of SNOMED CT that belong to the
        'findings' and 'disorders' hierarchies. The membership of these 
        hierarchies was determined from the parenthetical terms in the
        SNOMED CT fully specified names. The purpose of this subset is to
        allow the Problem List application to implement an 'extended
        search' capability should the user be unable to find a suitable
        term in the Problem List Standard data.
  
   A new mapping has been defined in the Mapping Definitions file (#757.32)
   for the SNOMED CT to ICD-9-CM mappings (SCT2ICD).  A new mapping has 
   also been defined for the SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM mappings (SCT210D), for
   future use.
   
   The SNOMED CT to ICD-9-CM mappings have been loaded into the Mappings 
   file (#757.33). 
  
   A new field, Designation Code (18) has been created in the Expressions
   file (#757.01). This is a multiple that allows a Designation Code and
   its associated Coding System to be stored for each expression.
  
   The "G" cross-reference logic of the Mappings File (#757.33) has been 
   updated.
  
   The replacement word functionality used by the subsets has been
   expanded.
  
   The "ASL" cross-reference of the Expressions file (#757.01) is
   recalculated to match the site file content.

 FTP (File Transfer Protocol) Software Retrieval:
 ================================================
   
        The KIDs (Kernel Installation & Distribution System) build is being
        distributed in a Packman Message from the National Patch Module
        (NPM).
   
        Data for this patch is being distributed in a global host file:
   
            Filename         FTP Protocol
            ------------     ------------
            LEX_2_51.GBL     ASCII
   
   
        The preferred method is to FTP this file from 
        download.vista.med.va.gov
        which will transmit the file from the first available FTP server.
   
        This file may also be downloaded directly from a particular FTP
        location at the following locations.
   
             Hines           ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
             Albany          ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
             Salt Lake       ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
   
             The file is available in the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory. 
             The file may take 8 minutes to 22 minutes to transfer.
  
  
 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
 =========================
  
     1)  Users may be on the system during the install of LEX*2.0*51.
         It is recommended that this patch be installed during non-peak
         hours.  This patch should take from 18 to 53 minutes to install
         depending on the system.
  
             Create a backup    10 -  26 minutes
             Load the Global     7 -  18 minutes
             Kids Install       36 -  66 minutes
             Total              53 - 110 minutes
  
     2)  Create a backup of the following global file before continuing:
  
             Lexicon Files            #757-757.41    ^LEX(
             SUBSET DEFINITIONS File  #757.2         ^LEXT(
  
         These backup files may get as large as 1.2 gigabytes.  Make sure
         space is available before proceeding.  It should take from 10 to
         26 minutes to create the backup files.
  
         Before you begin backing up the data in the ^LEX global, first 
         clear out the UNRESOLVED NARRATIVE file 757.06.  This will 
         prevent the backup procedure from encountering a control character
         and aborting in error.  At the programmer prompt, issue the 
         following MUMPS command to remove the control characters:
  
            >D CLR^LEXAR7 
  
         When you are creating a backup of non-subscripted globals, you are
         saving the entire global.  You should use the utility ^%GO for
         non-subscripted globals, and when prompted for a global, enter 
         the global root (global name only, no open parenthesis, no file
         number and no commas, as shown below).  Examples:
  
             Enter            To create a Backup copy of:
             ------           --------------------------
             ^LEX             Lexicon Files
             ^LEXT            SUBSET DEFINITIONS File 
  
     3)  Install the data from the global host file LEX_2_51.GBL.  This
         file contains the Lexicon Utility's import global ^LEXM.
  
         This global is approximately 397.4 megabytes in size.  Make sure
         there is sufficient space available to load this global with
         journaling on.  The loading of the global should take from 
         7 to 18 minute.
  
         From the Programmer prompt, execute the following routine:
  
             >D ^%GI 
             
             Global input
             
             Device: VA5$:[ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE]LEX_2_51.GBL
             Parameters? "RS" => 
             Globals were saved on 20 Jun 2012   2:39 PM   Cache
             with description: LEX*2*51 Data
             
             Input option: A
             ^LEXM
  
     4)  Set up user and IO variables (D ^XUP) for programmer access.
  
     5)  Distribution Load:
  
         Load the KIDS Distribution from the Packman Message using the
         Packman function "Install/Check Message."
  
     6)  KIDS Installation:
  
         Install the patch using the KIDS Installation Menu action
         "Install Package(s)" and the install name LEX*2.0*51.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during
           the install?" prompt.
  
           Respond "NO" at the "Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options,
           Menu Options, and Protocols?" prompt.
  
         The KIDs install should take from 36 - 66 minutes
  
     7)  Cleanup
  
         a)  The Environment Check routine LEX2051 and the Post-Install 
             routine LEX2051P should be deleted using the KERNEL option 
             'Delete Routines' [XTRDEL] upon completion of the
             installation.
  
             NOTE:  The installation of this patch should trigger an
                    update protocol and may spawn background tasks for 
                    the Clinical Reminders or Consult packages.  You 
                    do not need to wait for these background jobs to 
                    complete to delete the Environment Check and 
                    Post-Install routines.
