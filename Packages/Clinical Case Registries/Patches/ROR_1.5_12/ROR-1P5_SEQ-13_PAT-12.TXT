 PROBLEM:
 --------
 Patients that have a positive HEPC test result are not being 
 displayed into the HEPC registry after the installation of the Automated 
 Lab Instruments patch LA*5.2*68.  A modification was  made that affected
 Lab Application Programmer Interfact (API) (GCPR^LA7QRY) which is utilized
 by  Clinical Case Registries to collect Lab Test Result Codes.
      
 Resolution:
 -----------   
 A modification will be made in routine RORUPR1 to populate the 
 RORLRC variable so Lab Test Result Codes will be identified.  This will
 result in patients  being displayed into the HEPC registry properly based
 on their lab test results.
