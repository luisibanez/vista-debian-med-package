 =========================== 
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
 logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
 installed.
  
 NOTE: The nightly task (the [ROR TASK] option) must not be running
       during the installation.
  
 1. Check the user who scheduled the nightly job, ROR TASK.  The task must 
 be scheduled by an active user with the ROR VA IRM security key.  If the 
 user has been terminated or no longer has the key, make sure the job is 
 re-scheduled by a qualified user.
  
 2. Make sure you have the ROR VA IRM security key.

       the components of the KIDS build.
   c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
       patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
       (routines, Data Dictionaries (DD's), templates, etc.).
   d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
       backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
