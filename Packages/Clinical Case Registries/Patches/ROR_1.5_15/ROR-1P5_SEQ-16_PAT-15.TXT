Description:
============

 The following is a list of changes included in this patch:
  
 1. Two new HCV generic drugs, Telaprevir and Boceprevir, and one new HIV
 drug, Rilpivirine, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
 in May, 2011.  These three medications have been added to the ROR GENERIC
 DRUG (#799.51) file and can now be selected on reports to provide
 information about the patients who are taking the new medications.
  
 2. The Renal Function by Range Report has been enhanced to include a new
 option for calculating the eGFR called the CKD-EPI equation. The CKD-EPI
 GFR is an estimate of glomerular filtration (GFR) using serum creatinine
 and demographic factors.  It is a relatively new equation that is believed
 to be superior to the MDRD GFR equation. If selected, the CKD-EPI scores
 are summarized on the report by chronic kidney disease stage.
  
 3. The result ranges panel on the "Renal Function by Range" report will 
 include a note that reads, "Lab tests used to calculate renal function 
 are identified by LOINC code.  Your local lab ADPAC should be contacted 
 regarding errors in LOINC codes." 
  
 4. The header on the "Renal Function by Range" report currently reads, 
 "Lab tests used to calculate Cockcroft-Gault and/or eGFR by MDRD scores 
 are identified by LOINC code."  This text will be updated to read, "Lab 
 tests used in calculations are identified by LOINC code."  
  
 5. The cover sheet text of the "Renal Function by Range" report will be 
 amended to include the list of LOINC codes that are used.  The new text 
 on the "Renal Function by Range" report will read, "Your local lab ADPAC
 should be contacted regarding errors in LOINC codes."  
  
 6. Currently, the "Liver Score by Range" report includes rows for tests 
 that are not related to the test(s) selected by the user.  Test rows 
 should no longer appear if they are not used in the report calculations.  
 If the user selects the APRI and/or FIB4 tests, then the Bili, Cr, INR, 
 and Na rows should not appear on the report.  If the user selects the 
 MELD and/or MELDNA tests, then the AST, Platelet, and ALT rows should not 
 appear on the report.  
  
 7. The result ranges panel on the "Liver Score by Range" report will 
 include a note that reads, "Lab tests used in calculations are identified 
 by LOINC code.  Your local lab ADPAC should be contacted regarding errors 
 in LOINC codes."  
  
 8. Users may now use 'Diagnosed at this VA' as a local field.  The field
 is based on the answer to the Patient Data Editor question - 'Was your VA
 facility/station the first healthcare setting (VA or non-VA) to diagnose
 HIV?'.  If Include is selected, only patients with this question answered
 Yes will be included on the report.  If Exclude is selected, only patients
 with this question answered No or Unknown will appear on the report.
  
 9. Users may now use the Select All Divisions button to display all
 divisions in the left hand pick box.
  
 10. The CDC Form has been modified to correct the transposition of check
 box values for the "Bisexual male" and "Intravenous/injection drug user"
 questions.
  
 11. The CDC Form has been modified to check the appropriate checkbox if
 the user selects 'yes' to the question "Received Clotting Factor for
 Hemophilia/Coagulation disorder".
  
 12. An invalid date check and error message have been added for the
 question, "Received transfusion of blood/blood components (other than
 clotting factor)" on the Risk Factors Tab in the Patient Editor.
  
 13. A future date check and error message have been added for the
 question, "Received transfusion of blood/blood components (other than
 clotting factor)" on the Risk Factors Tab in the Patient Editor.
  
 14. A future date check and error message have been added for the
 question, "Did the patient ever have an AIDS OI?" on the Clinical Status
 Tab in the Patient Editor.
  
 15. The Non-VA Medication back pull will run during the nightly task 
 after the patch is installed.
  
 16. The Date Range panels (Date Range, Medications Date Range, Lab Tests 
 Date Range and Utilization Date Range) were re-designed for easier use 
 with Assistive Technology.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 -------------------------------
   1. IMPORTANT NOTE:  Before installing the patch, please verify that
      errors in non-VA medications have been corrected. If these errors are
      not corrected, the CCR backpull of NON-VA medications will error out
      with the error <SUBSCRIPT>EN+7^PSOHCSUM.  See Instructions below.
  
   2. The pre-installation routine in the build deletes an invalid entry
      from the ROR HISTORICAL DATA EXTRACTION (#799.6) file.
  
   
 Installation Instructions
 -------------------------
 This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) executeable.
  
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
 logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
 installed.

       during the installation.
  
  
 Pre-Installation Instructions

    Erroneous Non-VA Meds Report [PSO NON-VA MEDS REPORT] to verify that 
    the Non-VA medication records at your site have no data integrity 
    errors.  CONTINUE TO THE NEXT STEP IF THIS OPTION DOES NOT EXIST.
  
    This report will check non-VA medications for bad data and send an
    email with the results. If errors are reported in the email, contact
    the site Pharmacy staff to use the options on the menu, Pharmacy
    Patient Non-VA Meds Report/Clean-up [PSOZ NON-VA MEDS REP/CLEAN] to
    clean up the errors. Further information is available in patch,
    PSO*7*288.
