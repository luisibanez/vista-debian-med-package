Description:
============

 The following is a list of changes included in this patch:
  
 1. The 13 risk factors for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
 registry have been changed from mandatory to optional.
  
 2. Currently, within the Patient Data Editor in the HIV registry, the
 user is prompted to click a checkbox if the patient "ever had an AIDS
 OI."  This prompt and checkbox has been replaced with the question 
 "Did the patient ever have an AIDS OI?" and the option to select 
 either Yes, No, or Unknown has been added to the checkbox.
  
 3. The following mandatory question has been added to the Patient 
 Data Editor:  "Was your VHA facility/station the first health care 
 setting (VA or non-VA) to diagnose HIV?" along with a checkbox to 
 select either Yes, No or Unknown.
  
 4. A new column has been added to the List of Registry Patients 
 Report that allows the user to select "Diagnosed at this Facility".
 This column indicates whether this facility was the first health care
 setting (VA or Non-VA) to diagnose HIV.
  
 5. The nightly extract has been enhanced to include Purchased Care 
 data for registry patients.
  
 6. The "MELD Score by Range" report has been renamed to "Liver Score 
 By Range". 
  
 7. The "Liver Score by Range" report now includes the list of Logical 
 Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) codes used in the report.
  
 8. The "Renal Score by Range" report now includes the list of LOINC
 codes used in the report.
  
 9. The "Liver Score by Range" report now includes AST Platelet Ratio 
 Index (APRI) and FIB-4 calculations.
  
 10. Patients will be automatically confirmed into the Hepatitis C (HEPC)
 Registry if they have a positive Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) viral load test 
 result.
  
 11. This patch brings the Clinical Case Registries (CCR) application
 into 508 compliance in many areas.
  
 12. An historical data extraction for Purchased Care is added to the
 ROR HISTORICAL DATA EXTRACTION file (#799.6) for automatic execution 
 during the next nightly extract. 
  
 13. Additional LOINCs have been added to the VA HEPC Lab Search criteria.
