Description:
============

 The following is a summary of changes included in this patch:
  
 1. An additional Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC)
    value has been added to the VA HEPC Lab Search criteria.
  
 2. The nightly extract has been enhanced to include Non-VA medications
    for registry patients.
  
 3. The Patient Medication History report has been enhanced: it allows
    users to select the most recent fill, or all fills, and the report
    output has a column displaying the number of fills remaining.
  
 4. Reports BMI by Range, MELD Score by Range, and Renal Function by Range 
    have been enhanced to allow users to sort by the calculations.
  
 5. Most reports will now allow users to select specific patients,
    clinics, or divisions.
  
 6. When users want to select specific medications for the Combined Meds
    And Labs report, the Pharmacy Prescription Utilization report, or the 
    Patient Medication History report, the text in the search box will 
    automatically convert to uppercase.
  
 7. The CCR GUI application will perform a check to ensure that the
    associated M patch has been installed.  The full benefits of this
    feature will come into play with the release of future CCR GUI
    application version ROR*1.5*14.
  
  
 8. This patch brings the Clinical Case Registries (CCR) application
    into 508 compliance in many areas.
  
 9. An historical data extraction for Non-VA meds is added to the ROR 
    HISTORICAL DATA EXTRACTION file (#799.6) for automatic execution  
    during the next nightly extract. 
  
  
  
 CHANGES IN DETAIL
 =================
  
  
 Change 1
 ---------
 LOINC value 57006 is added to the VA HEPC entry of the Lab Search 
 criteria in the ROR LAB SEARCH file (#798.9), sub-file LAB TEST (#2).
  
  
  
 Change 2
 ---------
 The nightly and historical HL7 extracts have been enhanced to include ORC 
 and RXE segments for Non-VA medications for registry patients.  Non-VA
 medication data will be pulled if the DOCUMENTED DATE (#11) or the
 DISCONTINUED DATE (#6) in the NON-VA MEDS sub-file (#52.2) of the 
 PHARMACY PATIENT file (#55) is within the extract range.  For details of 
 the data included in the segments, please refer to the CCR Technical 
 Manual.
   
  
  
 Change 3
 ---------
 The Patient Medication History report has been enhanced to allow users
 to select the most recent fill only, or all fills.  The report output has
 been enhanced to include a column displaying the number of fills 
 remaining.
  
  
  
 Change 4
 ---------
 Reports BMI by Range, MELD Score by Range, and Renal Function by Range 
 have been enhanced to allow users to sort the report output by the 
 calculations.  The BMI by Range report can be sorted by the BMI score.  
 The MELD Score by Range report can be sorted by the MELD or the MELD-Na 
 score.  The Renal Function by Range report can be sorted by the CrCL or 
 the eGFR score.
  
  
  
 Change 5
 ---------
 All reports except Outpatient Utilization, Inpatient Utilization, 
 List of Registry Patients, and Current Inpatient List will allow users
 to select specific clinics or divisions.  All reports except List of
 Registry Patients and  Current Inpatient List will allow users to 
 select specific patients.  The Clinic Follow-Up report will allow
 a clinic selection along with division or patient, if desired.
  
  
 Change 6
 ---------
 When users want to select specific medications in the Combined Meds
 And Labs report, the Pharmacy Prescription Utilization report, or the 
 Patient Medication History report, the text in the search box will 
 automatically convert to uppercase.
  
  
 Change 7
 ---------
 The CCR GUI application will perform a check to ensure that the
 correct M code has been installed.  If it has not, then the GUI
 application will display a message in a pop-up box, similar to this:
  
 Server version (1.5.12) does NOT meet the minimum version (1.5.13) 
 required by the client.  
 Please contact your local IRM for resolution.
  
  
 Note: If the GUI v13 is installed but the M patch v13 is not installed,
 then the following message will be displayed in a pop-up box on the GUI:
  
 Error encountered retrieving VistA data.
 Server: xx.xx.xx.xx                                       
 Listener port: xxxx
 Remote procedure: ROR GET M VERSION
 Error is:
 Remote Procedure 'ROR GET M VERSION' doesn't exist on the server.
  
  
 If the above error is received, install the ROR*1.5*13 M patch.
  
 The full benefits of this feature will come into play with the release of
 future CCR GUI application version ROR*1.5*14.
  
  
 Change 8
 ---------
 The CCR GUI was updated to work towards becoming fully 508 compliant.
  
  
  
 Change 9
 ---------
 An historical data extraction for Non-VA meds is added to the ROR 
 HISTORICAL DATA EXTRACTION file (#799.6).  It will automatically execute 
 during the next nightly extract, and there is no manual intervention 
 required by the sites.  The extraction date range for this historical 
 data extraction is 1/1/1985 through current date (installation date).
