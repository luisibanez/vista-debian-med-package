Description:
============

 Description:
 ===========
  
 The following is a list of changes included in this patch:
  
 1. A new HIV generic drug, EMTRICI./RILPIVIRINE/TENOFOVIR (Complera) was 
 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This new medication 
 has been added to the ROR GENERIC DRUG (#799.51) file and can now be 
 selected on reports to provide information about the patients taking the 
 new medication.
  
 2. The List of Registry Patients report has been enhanced to allow users 
 to specify an Only Confirmed After date.  If the user selects this 
 feature, the Pending box will be disabled.  This will allow users to 
 generate a list of recently confirmed patients that have been added to 
 the registry after a specific date.
  
 3. A new diagnosis group, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), has been 
 added to the common templates.  The ICD code for PTSD is 309.81.
  
 4. Lab test selection on the Lab Utilization report, the Combined Meds 
 and Labs report, the DAA Lab Monitoring report and the Edit Site 
 Parameters option in the GUI has been changed to be case insensitive.  
 For example, if a user enters "zinc" as a search criterion, all test 
 names for "zinc" will be returned regardless of the case of the test name 
 in file #60 (e.g. zinc, Zinc, ZINC, zINC, etc.).  This problem was 
 reported in Remedy ticket #215842.
  
 5. The text on the Result Ranges panel and the report header of the Liver 
 Score by Range report have been modified to provide additional 
 instruction.  
  
 6. The text on the Result Ranges panel and the report header of the Renal 
 Function by Range report have been modified to provide additional 
 instruction.
  
 7. A new HepC report, Potential DAA Candidates, has been added to 
 identify patients who may be eligible for the new HepC Direct Acting 
 Anti-Viral(DAA) medications. The user may request a list of HepC patients 
 with treatment histories of 'naive' and/or 'experienced'.  Patients who 
 are 'naive' have never taken any registry medications.  Patients who are 
 'experienced' have not received DAA medications but have taken other 
 registry medications.  The user may choose to exclude experienced 
 patients who have fills for other registry medications within a specified 
 number of days.
  
 8. A new HepC report, DAA Lab Monitoring, has been added to monitor 
 laboratory results for patients who have taken DAAs.  The user may 
 display the two most recent test results prior to the first DAA fill date 
 as well as selected lab test results for X weeks after the first DAA fill 
 date.  The user may also restrict the lab test results after the first 
 DAA fill date to be the most recent.  Any registry medications for the 
 patient filled 60 days before the first DAA fill date through today 
 display automatically on the report.
  
 9. The preview and printing of the CDC form has been modified to correct 
 the transposition of check box values for the risk factors, "Bisexual 
 male" and the "Intravenous/injection drug user".
  
 10. An installation problem with the CCR help file referenced in Remedy 
 ticket #233500 is corrected.
  
 11. This patch brings the Clinical Case Registries (CCR) application into 
 508 compliance in many areas.
