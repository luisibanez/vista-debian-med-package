Description:
============

 The following is a list of changes included in this patch:
  
 1. This patch is designed to allow reporting tools used with the national 
 Hepatitis C and HIV registries to be used with local registries. Sixteen 
 new local registries are added based on ICD9-CM codes provided by the 
 national Office of Public Health/Population Health.  The new registries 
 represent patient diagnostic groups for:
  Diabetes
  Mental Health
  Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)
  Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)
  Breast Cancer
  Hypertension
  Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD)
  Osteoarthritis
  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
  Dyslipidemia
  Chronic Renal Disease (CRD)
  Alzheimer's Disease
  Rheumatoid Arthritis
  Low Vision/Blind
  Amputation
  Multiple Sclerosis 
  
 2. An option, 'Initialize new registries (one time)' is provided to 
 schedule the initial build of the new registries.  The option is locked
 with the ROR VA IRM security key. It is run one time and will search for
 patients with qualifying ICD9 codes linked to outpatient visits, problem
 lists and inpatient stays back to 1/1/1985.  Patients added to a local
 registry are automatically confirmed.  The confirmation date is set to the
 earliest date of the qualifying ICD9 code. Registries are not available to
 users until they are initialized.
  
 3. Once the registries are initialized, the nightly job (ROR TASK) 
 searches for new patients with qualifying ICD9 codes.  Patients added to 
 one of the 16 local registries are automatically confirmed.  The 
 confirmation date is set to the date of the qualifying ICD code.
  
 4. Only data from the national registries for HIV and Hepatitis C will be 
 transmitted to the national database.  
  
 5. Two new security keys have been added, ROR VA GENERIC ADMIN and ROR VA 
 GENERIC USER.  These keys only provide access to the local registries.  
  
 Users assigned the new ROR VA GENERIC ADMIN key will have the ability to
 delete patients from any of the sixteen local registries.  Patients are
 deleted immediately and the deletion is logged in the technical log.  If
 the patient has a future qualifying result, the patient is added back to
 the appropriate registry.
  
 Users with the ROR VA GENERIC USER key will have the ability to run 
 reports on all the local registries.
  
 6. It will no longer be necessary to run the option, 'Re-index the ACL 
 cross-reference' manually after assigning or un-assigning a security 
 key.  The user's access privileges will be automatically updated at the 
 time the user logs on.
  
 7. The Select a Registry screen displayed when the user logs on, will 
 list all the registries to which the user has keys.  The national 
 registries for Hepatitis C and HIV will be listed first.  The local 
 registries will be listed next in alphabetical order separated from the 
 national registries by a blank line.
  
 8. The Patient Screen for local registries does not include a "Pending 
 only" checkbox or a "Pending Comments" column because patients added to 
 local registries are automatically confirmed.
  
 9. Site parameters can be customized for local registries.  The site 
 parameters screen displays tabs for Lab Tests, Notifications and Local 
 Fields.  A generic tab on the right side of the screen displays 
 laboratory tests.  Select local laboratory tests under the Registry Lab 
 tab and move them to the right.  Once a laboratory test is added, it is 
 displayed in the middle pane of the Registry Lab Patient Data Editor.
  
 The names of VistA users who need to receive notifications about problems 
 in registry processes can be added under the Notifications tab.
  
 Local fields can also be added to individual local registries.  These 
 fields are used to include/exclude patients from reports. 
  
 10. The following reports can be run for local registries:
  BMI by Range Report
  Clinic Follow Up Report
  Combined Meds and Labs Report
  Current Inpatient List Report
  Diagnosis Report
  General Utilization and Demographics Report
  Procedures Report
  Radiology Utilization Report
  Inpatient Utilization Report
  Lab Utilization Report
  Liver Score by Range Report
  Outpatient Utilization Report
  Patient Medication History Report
  Pharmacy Prescription Utilization Report
  Renal Function by Range Report
  
 11.The List of Registry Patients can be run for local registries but has 
 been modified for use with local registries. The "Pending" checkbox has 
 been removed from the Report Status panel. "Pending comments" and "First 
 diagnosed at this facility" checkboxes have been removed from the Report 
 Options panel.
  
 12. The following reports are not supported for local registries:
  Registry Lab Tests by Range Report
  DAA Lab Monitoring Report
  Potential DAA Candidates Report
  VERA Reimbursement Report
  Registry Medications
  
 13. If the user has keys for the registries, the Other Registries 
 selection panel will display those registries.  Registries listed in this 
 panel can be used to include/exclude patients on reports.
  
 14. The Common Template for Depression has been deleted and replaced with 
 two new Common Templates for Major Depression and Other Depression.  
 These templates are used to filter patients based on diagnoses when 
 running reports.
  
 15. ROR TASK has been modified to automatically update all registries.  It
 is no longer necessary to list registries in the TASK PARAMETERS field.  
 The description of the option has been modified to reflect this change.
  
 16.  The Select Patient panel has been added to the DAA Lab Monitoring 
 report.

 Patch Installation Overview:
 ============================ 
  
 This patch includes an M patch and a revised Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) executeable.
  
 Below is a summary of the installation steps required for this patch.
  
 1.  Install M components.
 2.  Update GUI.
 3.  Schedule ROR INITIALIZE to initialize local registries.
 4.  Assign new security keys, ROR VA GENERIC ADMIN and ROR VA GENERIC 
 USER.
  
 M Installation Instructions:
 =========================== 
 Installation of the patch will not take more than 5 minutes. This patch
 can be installed with VistA users online, but Registry users should be
 logged out of the CCR Registry Application, as a new GUI is to be
 installed.
  
 NOTE: The nightly task (the [ROR TASK] option) must not be running
       during the installation.
  
 1. Check the user who scheduled the nightly job, ROR TASK.  The task must 
 be scheduled by an active user with the ROR VA IRM security key.  If the 
 user has been terminated or no longer has the key, make sure the job is 
 re-scheduled by a qualified user.
  
 2. Make sure you have the ROR VA IRM security key.
  
 3. Use the "INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE" option on the PackMan menu. This
    option loads the patch into a Transport Global on your system.
  
 4. From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS)
    menu, select the Installation menu.
  
 5. From this menu, you may elect to use the following options:
    (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter ROR*1.5*18)
  
   a.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global - This option will allow
       you to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the
       transport global.
   b.  Print Transport Global - This option will allow you to view
       the components of the KIDS build.
   c.  Compare Transport Global to Current System - This option will
       allow you to view all changes that will be made when this
       patch is installed.  It compares all components of this patch
       (routines, Data Dictionaries (DD's), templates, etc.).
   d.  Backup a Transport Global - This option will create a backup
       message of any routines exported with this patch. It will not
       backup any other changes such as DD's or templates.
  
 6. Use the Install Package(s) option and select the package
     ROR*1.5*18.
  
    The following messages display:

 Post-Installation Instructions:
 ==============================
  
 These instructions explain how to schedule the option, ROR INITIALIZE.  
 This option will populate the new registries with patients. 
  
  
 1. <<< IMPORTANT >>> Before you schedule the option, notify your system
 manager that the size of the global, ^RORDATA, is estimated to increase
 from 7 to 10 times its current size.
  
  
 2. After you have notified the system manager, make sure you have the ROR
 VA IRM key and then schedule the option, ROR INITIALIZE, to run.  
  
 <<< IMPORTANT >>> This option may take well over 24 hours to complete.  It
 can be stopped and re-started at any time.  When you schedule it, you have
 the option to suspend its execution during peak business hours.  The
 option may be running at the same time ROR TASK runs.

 4. If you want to stop the task for any reason use the option, XUTM USER
 in the User's Toolbox. All tasks will be terminated when any one task is
 stopped. Tasks complete the patient they are currently processing before
 stopping so it can take a few minutes to see that these tasks have been
 removed from TaskMan. Allow five minutes before checking TaskMan.
  
 To re-start the task, run the option ROR INITIALIZE again. When the
 initialization is re-started, the patients already processed during the
 previous stopped tasks are skipped.
  
 5.  Check that the task completed successfully. You will receive VIEW
 ALERTS after successful completion of the Registry Initialization
 process.  The system produces the following Alerts:
  
 ROR: Initialization of registry VA ALZHEIMERS succeeded
 ROR: Initialization of registry VA AMPUTATION succeeded
 ROR: Initialization of registry VA BLIND succeeded
 ROR: Initialization of registry VA BREAST CA succeeded
