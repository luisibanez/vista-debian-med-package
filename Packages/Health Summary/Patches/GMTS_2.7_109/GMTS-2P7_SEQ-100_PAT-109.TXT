Subject: REMOTE HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE TITLE CHANGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This Patch will fix an existing design flaw that was brought to light 
 after the install of GMTS*2.7*105. The TITLE field (#.02) in the HEALTH 
 SUMMARY TYPE file (#142) for many remote Health Summary reports does not
 include the word "Remote".

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1. INC000000842628 - Patch GMTS*2.7*105 assistance with titles
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After the install of GMTS*2.7*105, which changed reports to use Titles 
 instead of Names, many Remote Health Summary reports did not include 
 the word "Remote" in the TITLE field (#.02) in the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE 
 file (#142). Also, some Titles were in all UPPER case.  Site was 
 looking for a way to have the Remote Health Summary types display as 
 they did prior to the patch with the .01 NAME field. When the site 
 tried locally to edit the titles of these Remote Health Summary types 
 it resulted in other sites receiving errors accessing the modified 
 site's Remote Health Summary data.
  
 The following are the existing entries before the patch.
  
 NAME                            TITLE
 ============================    =======================
 REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (1Y)       Clinical Data (1y)
 REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (3M)       Clinical Data (3m)
 REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (4Y)       Clinical Data (4y)

 REMOTE LABS ALL (1Y)            Labs All (1y)
 REMOTE LABS ALL (3M)            Labs All (3m)
 REMOTE LABS LONG VIEW (12Y)     Labs Long View (12Y)
 REMOTE MEDS/LABS/ORDERS (1Y)    Meds/Labs/Orders (1y)

 REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW            Oncology View
 REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (1Y)        Text Reports (1y)
 REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (3M)        Text Reports (3m)
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Change the TITLE field (#.02) of the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file 
 (#142) entries to the following:
  
 NAME                            TITLE
 ============================    =======================
 REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (1Y)       Remote Clinical Data (1y)

 REMOTE CLINICAL DATA (4Y)       Remote Clinical Data (4y)

 REMOTE LABS LONG VIEW (12Y)     Remote Labs Long View (12y)
 REMOTE MEDS/LABS/ORDERS (1Y)    Remote Meds/Labs/Orders (1y)
 REMOTE MEDS/LABS/ORDERS (3M)    Remote Meds/Labs/Orders (3m)
 REMOTE MH HIGH RISK PATIENT     Remote MH High Risk Patient
 REMOTE ONCOLOGY VIEW            Remote Oncology View
 REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (1Y)        Remote Text Reports (1y)
 REMOTE TEXT REPORTS (3M)        Remote Text Reports (3m)
  
 Pre install routine GMTSP109 will use a ^DIE call to change the TITLE 
 field and then generate a MailMan message notifying the user of the 
 changes
  
 The message will look similar to the following:
