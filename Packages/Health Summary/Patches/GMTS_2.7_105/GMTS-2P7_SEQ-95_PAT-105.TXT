 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000245075
   
    Problem:
    --------
    A <SUBSCRIPT>GETSEL+16^GMTSADH2 error occurs when editing an AD HOC
    health summary report using the [AD HOC HEALTH SUMMARY] option. This
    happens if a component that has "9999999.64" in its SELECTION FILE
    multiple is edited.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Allowed components that have "9999999.64" in its SELECTION FILE 
    multiple to process properly.
  
    Technical Resolution:
    ---------------------
    Routine GMTSADH2 has been modified to use the GMTSEG(SBS) variable 
    instead of GMX. 
  
 2. HD0000000606070
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The descriptions of the "MHA Administration List" & "MHA Score"
    health summary components contain spelling errors.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Attempt to correct the spelling errors if the description has not
    already been modified.
  
    ***Note: If the description has been modified in any way, the spelling
             errors may not get corrected.
  
    Technical Resolution:
    ---------------------
    Created a pre-install routine GMTSP105 that checks to see if the text 
    is the same as the text when the component was released, if so it uses
    a WP^DIE call to replace the existing text.
  
  
 3. HD0000000624624
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs when the CPRS reports tab displays nationally
    released health summary types. If the parameter "ORWRP HEALTH SUMMARY
    LIST ALL" is not set to yes and the parameter "ORWRP HEALTH SUMMARY
    TYPE LIST" includes a nationally released health summary. Instead
    displaying the "TITLE" field it will display the "name" field.
   
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Made CPRS display the Title field for nationally released Health 
    summary types
  
    Technical Resolution:
    ---------------------
    Routine GMTSXAB has been modified to use the GMTST (the title) variable
    if it has more than 0 characters and default to GMTSNM (the name) if
    not.
