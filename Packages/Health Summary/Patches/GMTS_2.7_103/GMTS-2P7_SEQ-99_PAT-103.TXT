Subject: HIGH RISK MH PT PROJECT NEW HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT & TYPES-USH LEGAL SOLUTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()
  - Other
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This patch is part of a multi-package build that addresses the Under 
 Secretary of Health (USH) legal solution. The legal solution impacts the 
 High Risk Mental Health Patient - National Reminder and Flag (HRMHP) 
 project. A new national category 1 patient record flag (PRF) will provide 
 a tool to inform all Veteran Administration (VA) caregivers of special 
 guidelines that must be followed when documenting notes or dealing with 
 the patient. This flag will require special permissions in order to be 
 assigned to a patient and once assigned it cannot be modified or 
 inactivated other than allowing the reassignment of the owning facility. 
 Detailed information about this new PRF can be found in the DG*5.3*864 
 patch description and the other documents outlined in the documentation 
 section below.
  
 This GMTS patch will install one new Health Summary Component and two new 
 Health Summary Types.  The Health Summary Types use the Health Summary 
 Component to display all Active and Inactive national (Category 1) PRFs 
 that are assigned to a given patient.  Details of each new item are in 
 the 'Patch Components' section of this patch description.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 GMTS*2.7*103 will run an environment check routine to ensure that IEN 257 
 in ^GMT(142.1 is unused and will also check for any NAME (.01) or 
 ABBREVIATION (3) conflicts with the new component.  If any conflicts are 
 found, the environment check will indicate the conflict, the install will 
 abort, and the transport global will be unloaded from the system.
  
 The pre-install routine will remove any previous version of the Reminder 
 Exchange file that is used to install the two new Health Summary Types.  
 In the event of multiple installations, this step ensures that the 
 Reminder Exchange file used during installation is from the build instead 
 of the version stored in the REMINDER EXCHANGE file (#811.9).
  
 The post-install routine, GMTSY103, will install the Health Summary 
 the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1).  This routine will also 
 initiate the Reminder Exchange installation for the Health Summary Types.
 This routine may be deleted from the system if storage space is a 
 concern.  Local IT staff should consider keeping a copy of GMTSY103 as it 
 may prove useful in the event of any unexpected issues with this patch.
  
  
 Pre-installation Instructions
 -----------------------------
 Prior to installing the patch, examine the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file 
 (#142.1) for any NUMBER (.001), NAME (.01), or ABBREVIATION (3) entries 
 that will conflict with the new component exported with this patch.  The 
 national component NUMBER, NAME, and ABBREVIATION are as follows:
  
 NUMBER (IEN)            NAME                            ABBREVIATION
 257                     CAT I PT RECORD FLAG STATUS     PRF1
  
 Internal Entry Numbers below 100001 are reserved for National health 
 summary components.  It is extremely unlikely your site will have a 
 component stored at IEN 257 as doing so would require programmer access 
 and manual editing of the ^GMR(142.1 global.  To check the global on your 
 system, look at ^GMT(142.1,257.  That location should be empty.  If not, 
 your site will need to submit a Remedy ticket for Health Summary support 
 to assist in cleaning up that global entry.  Before submitting the 
 ticket, if the component is actually in use at your site and should be 
 kept, it can be recreated at a local IEN and with a slightly different 
 name.  Use the "Create/Modify Health Summary Components" option of the 
 GMTS IRM MAINTENANCE MENU to recreate the component.  After recreating 
 the component, submit the Remedy ticket requesting Health Summary support 
 with: locating any items pointing to IEN 257, have those items re-pointed 
 to the new local component location, and cleaning up the unwanted entry 
 at IEN 257.
  
 The "B" cross-reference for the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1), 
 [^GMR(142.1,"B",], contains the NAME for each component.  Each component 
 entry in the file must have a unique NAME.  Examine the global listing 
 for this cross-reference to determine if any local component will need 
 the NAME field edited to avoid collision with the new national component.
  
 ^GMT(142.1,"B","CAT I PT RECORD FLAG STATUS",660187)="" <-Example of a 
 local component that will conflict with the incoming CAT I PT RECORD FLAG 
 STATUS component NAME. 
  
 The "C" cross-reference for the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1), 
 [^GMR(142.1,"C",], contains the ABBREVIATION for each component.  Each 
 component entry in the file must have a unique ABBREVIATION.  Examine the 
 global listing for this cross-reference to determine if any local 
 components will need the ABBREVATION field edited to avoid collision with 
 the new national component.
  
 ^GMT(142.1,"C","PRF1",660187="" <-Example of a local component that will 
 conflict with the incoming CAT I PT RECORD FLAG STATUS component 
 ABBREVIATION. 
  
 If a NAME or ABBREVIATION conflict is found, the "Create/Modify Health 
 Summary Components" option of the GMTS IRM MAINTENANCE MENU should be 
 used to edit the local component's NAME or ABBREVIATION.

 Post-Installation Instructions
 ------------------------------
 The two new Health Summary Types, VA-PT RECORD FLAG STATUS and REMOTE PT 
 RECORD FLAG STATUS must be added to the list of available reports 
 viewable in CPRS GUI. This can be done in different ways and from 
 several different menus.  Depending on local configuration, all health 
 summary types may be available for selection or the selection may be 
 configured to a defined list.  See "Health Summary Configuration" in the 
 Reports section of the CPRS Technical Manual: GUI Version for further 
 information.  Always follow your site's local policies on how to assign 
 these items to the list of available reports.  Any users with a CPRS 
 session open during the time of installation will need to close and 
 re-open CPRS in order to see the new Health Summary Types on the Reports 
 tab.
  
 This example uses the Health Summary Coordinator's menu 
 [GMTS COORDINATOR] to add the items for use at the System level.
