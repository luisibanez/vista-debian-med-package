Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following three issues in the Health Summary 
 package:
  
 1) Erroneous data is being created when using "^" at the "Overwrite No Data 
 Available Message" prompt while using option [GMTS OBJ ENTER/EDIT] 
  
 2) Not all the procedures are displaying when the user views the [SURGERY 
 SEL NON OR PROCEDURES] Health summary component
  
 3) When the user enters an "@" at the "Overwrite No Data Available Message" 
 prompt while using option [GMTS OBJ ENTER/EDIT] the text in the file is 
 not deleted
  
 ASSOCIATED REMEDY TICKET(S):
 ============================
 1) HD0000000372594 - Overwrite No Data Available Message error
 
 2) HD0000000736170 - Problem with health summary object
 
 3) HD0000000742769 - EDIT HS OBJECT FIELD NOT EDITABLE

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000372594 - Overwrite No Data Available Message error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs when the user enters an "^" followed by text at the 
    "Overwrite No Data Available Message" prompt while using option [GMTS OBJ 
    ENTER/EDIT]. This causes the "^" to get entered into the file creating 
    erroneous data.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the prompt so that if the user does use a "^" followed by text
    the system will exit the option.
  
    NODATA^GMTSOBA2 has been modified to do a pre-validation transform. If 
    the input contains "^" the system will convert the input into "^^"
  
    Created post install routine GMTSP106 to clean up existing erroneous 
    data. This routine will send a mailman message to the user that runs the 
    install stating which Health summary objects (If any) were updated. The 
    format of the message is as follows:
  
 Subj: GMTS*2.7*106 Post install routine has completed  [#142921] 
 12/10/12@17:03
 4 lines
 From: HEALTH SUMMARY PACKAGE  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1  *New*
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 GMTS*2.7*106 Post install routine has completed
 Bad records corrected:
  
 (1st Health Summary object here)
 (2nd Health Summary object here)
 (and so on) 
  
 (OR if no bad records are found)
 "No bad records found"
  
  
 2) HD0000000736170 - Problem with health summary object
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Not all the procedures are displaying when the user views the [SURGERY 
    SEL NON OR PROCEDURES] Health summary component. The component is 
    checking the user specified codes against the [PLANNED PRIN PROCEDURE 
    CODE] instead of the [PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE]
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Changed the component to check [PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE CODE] in File# 136 
  
    CHK^GMTSRON has been modified to use field .02 of the 136 file in the 
    $$GET1^DIQ call
   
    Please note that this patch corrects the Health Summary side of the
    SURGERY SEL NON OR PROCEDURES component. Although CPTs may be selected 
    for this component on the VISTA side, there is still an issue with
    selecting some CPT codes and their display in the AD HOC Health Summary
    on the CPRS Reports Tab. This will be corrected with a future CPRS patch.
 
    If the routine GMTSP106 is not deleted by the post installation process, 
    it may be deleted manually after the patch is successfully installed.
  
  
 3) HD0000000742769 - EDIT HS OBJECT FIELD NOT EDITABLE
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The problem occurs when the user enters an "@" at the "Overwrite No Data 
    Available Message" prompt while using option [GMTS OBJ ENTER/EDIT]. The 
    current text doesn't get deleted from the object.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Made entering the "@" cause the text to be deleted
  
    NODATA^GMTSOBA2 has been modified to check the non-validated user input. 
    If it is a "@" GMTSOBJ("NO DATA") will be set to "@", if not it will be 
    what the user entered (after validation)
