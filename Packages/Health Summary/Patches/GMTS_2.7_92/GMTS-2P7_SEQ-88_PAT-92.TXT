Subject: CORRECTIONS TO MEDICATION WORKSHEET (TOOL #2)

Description:
============

 Patches PSO*7*316 and GMTS*2.7*92 correct issues reported with the 
 Tool #2: Medication Worksheet. The Health Summary patch GMTS*2.7*92
 will require patch PSO*7*316 and will create a national entry in the
 HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) for Tool #2: Medication Worksheet.
  
  
 1.  Current functionality for display of patient Social Security Number 
 was not being provided within the report in a format consistent with other
 Class I Health Summary components.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The report was hard-coded to display a patient's last four digits of the 
 SSN in the body of the report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Removed the programming that displayed the last four digits of patient SSN
 directly within the Health Summary component. Health Summary patch 
 GMTS*2.7*85 introduced a feature that permits the removal of the patient
 SSN from the health summary overall header. The change in this patch now
 similarly permits the worksheet to be printed with no SSN references
 remaining. All control of the patient identifiers, such as display of
 patient date of birth and SSN, is now controlled by the parameters set at
 the Health Summary Type level, consistent with other Class I Health
 Summary components.
  
 2.  Wrong pharmacy division name printing on the report header.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 At integrated sites, the name of the primary facility division would
 print on the report even when generated from another pharmacy division.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The internal programming that selects the name of the pharmacy
 division shown at the top of the worksheet and the pharmacy phone
 number associated with it has been revised. 
  
 At facilities where there are multiple entries in OUTPATIENT 
 SITE file (#59) that share the same SITE NUMBER, the Medication Worksheet
 is unable to distinguish between these entries in order to choose the
 correct pharmacy name and phone number for display in the report header.  
 In these cases, the result may be that the displayed name and phone number
 are for a division other than the pharmacy's preferred phone number for 
 patient calls. 
  
 3.  Medication Worksheet does not distinguish ACTIVE and HOLD status 
 prescriptions.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 In the initial release of Medication Reconciliation software with 
 PSO*7*294, one of the known issues was that a prescription with status of 
 HOLD was not clearly identified as such in the Medication Worksheet.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A status indicator is added for prescriptions with status of HOLD, 
 similar to the existing indicator for PENDING prescriptions in that 
 report.
  
 4.  The initial release of Medication Reconciliation tools with patch 
 PSO*7*294 required manual creation of Health Summary components.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There is no guarantee that all VA facilities set up the components 
 exactly as indicated in the Medication Reconciliation Implementation 
 Guide.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This patch introduces the following file entries with nationally 
 standardized internal entry numbers (IENs).
  
         HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1)
         ======================================
         Entry #252 - Medication Worksheet (Tool #2)
  
         HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE file (#142)
         ===============================
         The above-listed Health Summary Component (IEN #252) will be added
         to the existing GMTS HS ADHOC OPTION Health Summary type
  
         VAQ - DATA SEGMENT file (#394.71)
         =================================
         This file contains an entry corresponding to the above-listed
         Health Summary Component (IEN #252) that will be listed as
         Medication Worksheet (tool #2).
