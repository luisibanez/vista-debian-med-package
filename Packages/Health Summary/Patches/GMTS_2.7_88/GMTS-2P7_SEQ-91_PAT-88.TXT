Subject: LAB REFORMAT/142.1 UPDATE/SII COMP/HS BY LOC REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch makes four changes to package GMTS - HEALTH SUMMARY:
  
 1. Display column headers of TIU-Health Summary(HS) Object components 
    when pulled up in succession.
 2. Update Lab references range displays on HS reports. 
 3. Update default value of fields TIME LIMITS and MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES for 
    HS components MHA Admin List [MHAL] and MHA Score [MHAS] HS components.
 4. Add new field, SHORT HS BY LOCATION COVER to the HEALTH SUMMARY 
    PARAMETERS FILE (#142.99) to allow the number of times each location 
    prints on the cover sheet to be changed from 6 times to 1 time.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
  
 1. HD0000000070142 - TIU-HS Object (SII) not pulling column header
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Column headers are not displaying for the Imaging Impression Selected
 component (SII) when it is pulled up in succession.  For example, if you 
 create a progress note that contains a TIU-HS object that has the SII 
 component as boilerplate text, then create another note in the same 
 session, the headers will not display on any but the first note.  This 
 problem also manifests itself in the Health Summary Objects Menu [GMTS 
 OBJ MENU] in option Test a Health Summary Object [GMTS OBJ TEST].
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The variable GMTSPC needed to be newed in the tag MAIN for routine 
 GMTSRASP.
  
 Routine: GMTSRASP
  
  
 2. HD0000000231399 - Health Summary changes to coincide with LR*5.2*356
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Two Health Summary routines need to be modified to coincide with changes
 brought about by Lab patch LR*5.2*372, which includes changes to the way
 certain reference ranges are displayed (the changes were originally 
 supposed to take place in LR*5.2*356). All Health Summary reports that
 display Lab references ranges are affected by this, which includes any
 report(s) that use(s) the components HEMATOLOGY [HEM], Lab Tests Selected
 [SLT], and/or Chem & Hematology [CH]. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The following changes were made with regard to the following rules:
  
   1.  If neither low or high reference value is defined, nothing prints.
   2.  If the low only is defined and it is equal to 0 it prints: Ref:>=0
   3.  If the low only is defined and the first character is "<" or ">" it
       prints: Ref: low_value
   4.  If the low only is defined and it is numeric it prints: Ref: >=10
   5.  If the low only is defined and it is alphanumeric it prints: 
       Ref: RVLow
   6.  If the high only is defined and it is equal to 0 it prints: Ref: 0
   7.  If the high only is defined and the first character is "<" or ">" 
       it prints: Ref: high_value
   8.  If the high only is defined and it is numeric it prints: Ref: <=20
   9.  If the high only is defined and it is alphanumeric it prints: 
       Ref: RVHIGH
   10. If both low and high are defined it prints: RVLOW - RVHIGH or 10 -
       20.

 3. HD0000000230879 - Mental Health Components
  
 Problem:
 --------
 With the release of patch GMTS*2.7*77 two new Health Summary components
 were added to the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT (#142.1) file, MHA 
 Administration List [MHAL] and MHA Score [MHAS].  The defaults for the
 TIME LIMITS APPLICABLE (#2) field and MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES APPLICABLE (#4)
 field were intended to be set to 'yes', but three of the fields were
 incorrectly set to a value of 1 (which is invalid), while one field was
 left blank.  Users, therefore, are not prompted for TIME LIMITS and MAX
 OCCURRENCES when adding these components to Health Summary types.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Any of these entries that have a value of '1' will be set to 'yes'. If
 the value of the fields were null upon installation of this patch, the 
 value will remain the same; however, users will be able to make edits to 
 the field if need be.
  
 Routine: GMTSP88
  
  
 4. HD0000000336184 - MENU OPTION GMTS HS BY LOC wasting many sheets 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Two issues were identified when printing the Hospital Location Health
 Summary [GMTS HS BY LOC].  First, when printing in standard Letter
 (8.5 x 11) format the name of each hospital location is printed six times
 on the cover page, resulting in an overflow onto the next page and a waste
 of paper.  Secondly, hospital locations that did not have any patients
 seen during the specified date range were printing this information on a
 new page, which results in two pages being used where one page would be
 sufficient. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A new field, SHORT HS BY LOCATION COVER (#.07), has been added to the
 HEALTH SUMMARY PARAMETERS FILE (#142.99) which will be checked upon
 printing the Hospital Location Health Summary [GMTS HS BY LOC]. If
 set to 'Y'(Yes), the cover page for each hospital location will print the
 name of the location one time instead of six times. This will reduce paper
 consumption when printing in standard Letter (8.5 x 11) format.
  
 After patch installation, the value of SHORT HS BY LOCATION will be null.
 To take advantage of the paper reduction, the new field must be set to 
 YES. The option Edit Health Summary Site Parameters [GMTS IRM/ADPAC
 PARAMETER EDIT] has been modified to allow users to edit/display this
 field. This option is selectable from the Health Summary Maintenance Menu
 [GMTS IRM/ADPAC MAINT MENU].
  
 EXAMPLE:
 --------
 Select Health Summary Maintenance Menu Option: 7  Edit Health Summary 
 Site Parameters
  
 Select HEALTH SUMMARY PARAMETERS: HOSPITAL  
 PROMPT FOR ACTION PROFILE: yes// 
 INCLUDE BAR CODES ON ACTION PROFILES: yes// 
 INCLUDE COMMENTS FOR LABS: no// 
 SPOOL DEVICE: PDX// 
 ERROR MESSAGE RECIPIENT: HS ERRORS// 
 SHORT HS BY LOC COVERS: Yes//  <-- Edit new field
  
  
 *Note: There should be only ONE entry in the HEALTH SUMMARY PARAMETERS
 file (#142.99) named 'HOSPITAL'. Also, if this parameter is set to 'N'(No)
 or left null, the name of each location will continue to print six times
 on the cover page(s).

 POST-INSTALL
 ============
 Patch GMTS*2.7*77 left the MAXIMUM OCCURRENCES APPLICABLE (#4) field blank
 for the MHAS component in the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT (#142.1) file. If
 your site wants this limit to apply it may have to be manually changed to
 'yes' in Fileman if not already done so.
  
 The HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT (#142.1) file will be updated with the
 post-install routine GMTSP88, which can be manually deleted upon 
 successful installation. If any part of the update is unsuccessful you
 should be notified by alert or Mailman message.  The alert will tell you
 which part(s) of the update failed and that the file should be manually
 updated, with instructions on how to do this below via Fileman.
 Alternatively, you could re-run the post-install routine from a
 programmer's prompt with the following command:  D EN^GMTSP88
