 Patch Installation:
  
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 Prior to installing the patch, the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) 
 needs to be examined for any ABBREVIATION entries that will conflict with 
 the four new components exported with this patch.  Each new national 
 component along with its ABBREVIATION is listed here:
  
 NAME                                    ABBREVIATION
 MAS CONTACTS                            CON
 MAS MH CLINIC VISITS FUTURE             MHFV
 MH HIGH RISK PRF HX                     MHRF
 MH TREATMENT COORIDNATOR                MHTC
  
 The "C" cross-reference for the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file (#142.1) 
 contains the ABBREVIATION for each component.  Examine the global listing 
 for this cross-reference to determine if any local components will need 
 the ABBREVATION field updated.
  
 ^GMT(142.1,"C","CMB",239)=""
 ^GMT(142.1,"C","CN",5)=""
 ^GMT(142.1,"C","CNB",240)=""
 ^GMT(142.1,"C","CON",660187="" <-Example of a local component that will 
 conflict with the incoming MAS CONTACTS component abbreviation. 
  
 If an ABBREVIATION conflict is found, the "Create/Modify Health Summary 
 Components" option of the GMTS IRM MAINTENANCE MENU should be used to 
 edit the local component's ABBREVIATION.
  
 This patch contains an installation routine (GMTSPI99) that will perform 
 an environment check, do any necessary housekeeping, and then install the 
 new Health Summary items.
  
 The environment check will examine the HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT file 
 (#142.1) to ensure there will not be any NAME (.01) or NUMBER (.001) 
 collisions with the four new nationally deployed Health Summary 
 Components (MAS CONTACTS, MAS MH CLINIC VISITS FUTURE, MH TREATMENT 
 COORDINATOR).  If any potential collisions are found, the install will be 
 ABORTED until the issue is resolved.  After the issue has been addressed, 
 local IT staff can re-install the patch using Restart Install of 
 Packages option.
  
 After the environment check, PRE^GMTSPI98  will delete 
 any previous versions of: the Reminder Exchange file used to deploy 
 portions of the Health Summary items, the Health Summary Components, and 
 the Health Summary Types. PRE will also re-index the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE 
 and HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT files along with rebuilding the Ad Hoc 
 Health Summary.
  
 After PRE, POST^GMTSPI98 will create stub entries in file #142 for the 
 remote Health Summary Type, and then call the silent Reminder Exchange 
 install utility to install the remaining Health Summary items.  Lastly, 
 POST will re-index the HEALTH SUMMARY TYPE and HEALTH SUMMARY COMPONENT 
 files along with rebuilding the Ad Hoc Health Summary.
  
 The routine GMTSPI98 contains the PRE and POST install actions for this 
 build. GMTSPI98 can be deleted after successful installation.
