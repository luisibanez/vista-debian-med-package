Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with the Mental Health
 package version 5.01 patch 60 (YS*5.01*60) as a multiple build KIDS file. 
 Therefore, this patch is an informational patch and does not contain a 
 build.
  
 Patch YS*5.01*60 removes functionality from the Mental Health package 
 that is no longer in use. The DD access level for the MEDICAL
 RECORD file (#90) is changed to "@". The MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL
 EXAM health summary component pulls data from file #90, and since that 
 file is no longer supported, the DISABLE FLAG is set to PERMANENT for 
 this component.
  
 Patch GMTS*2.7*102 will accomplish the following:
  
 (1) Inactivate the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM health summary component 
     by setting the DISABLE FLAG to PERMANENT.
 (2) Rebuild the Health Summary Adhoc Report (the GMTS HS ADHOC OPTION
     health summary type).
 (3) The post-installation routine will email a usage report titled
     PATCH GMTS*2.7*102 REPORT containing the following listings:
     (a) Health summary types that contain the MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL EXAM
         health summary component
     (b) Health summary objects that contain the health summary types
         listed in (a)
  
     The usage report is an informational report and no action is needed 
     by the site. The installer should consider forwarding this report to
     the local Clinical Application Coordinators (CACs).
