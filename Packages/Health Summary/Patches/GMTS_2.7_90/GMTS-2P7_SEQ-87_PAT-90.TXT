Subject: ADD EARLIEST APPROPRIATE DATE TO HS ADHOC REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch is being released in conjunction with CPRS GUI v28.  CPRS GUI 
 version 28 consists of five host files: PSS_1_151.KID, PSS_1_142.KID, 
 CPRS28_REQUIRED.KID, OR_PSJ_PXRM_28.KID and CPRS28_RELATED.KID. These 
 five host files contain software that support CPRS GUI v28 
 functionality.  The host files were created to simplify installation at 
 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities and to assist in the 
 phased implementation release method for CPRS v28.  CPRS v28 will follow 
 a phased implementation.  To see current status and target dates for 
 Sites/VISN/Region please refer to the following site:
  
 http://vaww.itfo.portal.va.gov/svcs/itfopmo/pre05/default.aspx
  
  
 Please refer to the "CPRS GUI v.28 and Associated Patches Installation 
 Guide" for installation sequence information.  This document is exported 
 as OR_30_280IG.doc and OR_30_280IG.pdf and is included in OR_30_280.ZIP.
