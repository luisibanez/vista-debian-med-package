Subject: INFORMATIONAL - VistA Standardization:  GEN. MED. REC. - I/O

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This informational patch is issued as directed in Memorandum: Open Source VistA
 Deployment (VAIQ #7256522), dated Aug 31, 2012. Refer to this document for
 specific details.
   
 A review of the VistA Standardization routines was completed for:
 Gen. Med. Rec -  I/O, version 4.0. A baseline list of the nationally released M
 routines and their official checksums is included below. VistA Standardization
 Certification represents the matching of the routine checksums, compared in the
 site's Production account only.
   
 The VistA Standardization Team performed an analysis of each site's Production
 environment. For any site with routine checksum variance, this team worked with
 the site to remediate any variance from the baseline. After the completion of
 this process, sites with no variance were identified as VistA Standardization
 Certified for the package. There is NO additional action required on the part
 of these sites. 
   
 For sites which had variance (local modification) and determined it was
 important to maintain for their Production environment, a waiver was requested.
 If approved, the waiver allows retention of the local modification to a VistA
 Standardization routine, as detailed in VA Directive 6402.
   
 Each site will be placed on one of the lists below:  
       VistA Standardization Certified Sites
       Sites with Approved/Pending Waiver
       Non-Compliant Sites with Pending Remediation
 The expectation for sites on the Non-Compliant Sites with Pending Remediation
 list is for their remediation to be completed, by either removing the
 modification or requesting a waiver. There will NOT be an additional
 Informational Only patch to move the site to the VistA Standardization
 Certified Sites list.
   
 Please Note:
       Environment check routines, pre or post installation routines remaining
 from previously installed patches, compiled routines (e.g. cross-reference), or
 prior package version routines, will NOT affect your site's standardization
 compliance. Their existence, or non-existence, at your site, or on the VistA
 Standardization routines list below, does not impact the VistA Standardization
 Certification. 
       VistA Standardization Certification for this package applies to the date
 specified in the Official Checksum heading below. If additional patches, or a
 newer version for the package, has been released since this date, the checksums
 for affected routines will be different. For these routines, refer to the
 patch/version documentation for the most up-to-date checksums.
