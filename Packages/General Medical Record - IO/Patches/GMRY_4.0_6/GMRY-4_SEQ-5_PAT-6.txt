 NOIS OVERVIEW:
 ==============
  
 DUB-0100-31658 Undefined HANG+8 GMRYED4
  
 Problem:
 --------
 1) The undefined error HANG+8 GMRYED4 is caused by
 the DA variable not being reset when the user ^ out
 of the application.
  
 2) After using Enter/Edit Patient Intake [NURCPE-I/O-INTAKE]
 option and then uses the Start/Add/DC IV and Maintenance
 [NURCPE-I/O-IV CARE] option and selects the Replace Same
 Solution. The IV information is displayed and then the 
 options for Start/Add/DC IV and Maintenance [NURCPE-I/O-IV CARE]
 are displayed again. This is caused by the GFLAG variable that
 is set and not killed when using the Enter/Edit Patient Intake
 [NURCPE-I/O-INTAKE] option.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 1) GMRYUT8 routine will be modified to reset the DA 
 variable if the user ^ out of the application.
  
 2) GMRYUT0 routine will be modified to kill the GFLAG
 variable prior to exiting the Enter/Edit Patient Intake
 [NURCPE-I/O-INTAKE] option.

      in your mapped routine set, please skip this step.
  
  3.  Start up the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu
      [XPD MAIN]:
  
           Edits and Distribution ...
           Utilities ...

           Load a Distribution
           Print Transport Global
           Compare Transport Global to Current System
           Verify Checksums in Transport Global
           Install Package(s)
           Restart Install of Package(s)
           Unload a Distribution
           Backup a Transport Global
  
  4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options
