Subject: ROES3 ELIGIBILITY MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses several issues that have come up at the VA Medical 
 Centers since the first release of the ROES package. All issues addressed 
 in this patch are related to the ROES application that runs from the CPRS 
 Tools menu (ROES3.exe). The ROES Desktop application (ROES3Desktop.exe) 
 is only included for issues 2 and 3 below.
  
  Issues addressed in this patch are:
  
 1.  As approved by the PSAS Program Office, all Veteran eligibility 
 determinations calculated by the software will be automatically 
 approved.  Veteran eligibility requests will no longer be sent to the 
 Prosthetic and Sensory Aids Service (PSAS) staff for approval.  Changes 
 in the background calculations for Veteran eligibility are detailed in 
 the Release Notes for this patch.
  
 2.  For added security, the web connection has been changed from clear 
 http to secure http using the https protocol identifier.
  
 3.  Adjustments were made for 64 bit terminal servers to access and use 
 the ROES web site.
  
 4.  Connections from CPRS to the ROES web server will only be allowed 
 from a VistA production account to prevent false Veteran information from 
 becoming a part of the national database.
  
 5.  Menu options, routines, remote procedure calls and security keys from 
 prior versions of ROES that are no longer needed will be removed.
         Obsolete Options removed:  RMPFDE2 and RMPFDE4
         Obsolete Routines removed:  RMPFDE1,RMPFDE2,RMPFDE3 and RMPFDE4
         Obsolete Keys removed:  RMPF SUPERVISOR and RMPF SYSTEM MANAGER
         Obsolete Remote Procedures removed: RMPF ELIG MSG and RMPFELIG
  
 6.  Modifications for VistA and Delphi coding standards are included.
  
 7.  Documentation has been updated regarding the removal of the 
 eligibility interactions before connecting to ROES.

  RMPF*3.0*1
  
  
  This patch contains the following enhancements and problem resolutions:
  ==========================================================
  
  The ROES application requires that the user's browser have JAVA
  available and enabled in order to function.  Sun has not developed a
  64-bit version of JAVA, so on 64-bit terminal server installations the
  browser is not JAVA capable. This may prevent some ROES features from
  working properly. 64-bit installations also have a 32-bit browser
  which resides at a location different from the normal 32-bit location.
  That new location is:
         C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE.
  
  The ROES executables that connect to the internet application have been
  modified to check for the 32-bit Internet Explorer at that location.
  This change will not affect any current 32-bit installations because, if 
  Internet Explorer is not found at that location, ROES will look in the
  usual installation directories:
         C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE or
         C:\Program Files\PLUS!\Microsoft Internet\IEXPLORE.EXE
  
  On a 64-Bit installation, if the ROES application still does not work
  properly after installing the new executable, please ensure the path
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE" does exist on
  the workstation.
  
  All workstations accessing the ROES application from either CPRS or the
  desktop need to have the RPCBroker Listener running, as in the previous
  releases of ROES. Refer to the RPCBroker Installation Guide for further
  direction, if needed. It can be retrieved from http://www.domain.ext/vdl.
  
  The following VistA routines have been modified to address new standards
  guidelines.
  
  1. RMPFRPC0 - Eligibility calculations were modified for new rules and
     categories and is now called directly from RMPFRPC1 instead of from
     remote procedure call RMPFELIG.
  
  2. RMPFRPC1 - DDC changed to DALC. Added check to see if running from a
     production account. Comments were added and clarified.

  Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.domain.ext      anonymous.software
  Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.domain.ext        anonymous.software
  
  
  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
  =========================
  
  
  Make a backup copy of the current ROES3.exe and ROES3Desktop.exe
  files (from a location where they currently are being used) to a
  backup location. Note the locations where all instances of those
  executables exist, for future maintenance.
  
  All obsolete options, routines and remote procedure calls from
  previous ROES versions will be removed during the installation. The list
  items being removed is listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY SECTION of the
  build.
  
  Only ROES users need be off the system while ROES*3.0*4 is being
  installed. This patch should be installed during non-peak hours to
  minimize disruption. The total installation may take 15 minutes or more,
  depending on the CPRS Tools menu structure and number of ROES and
  ROES Desktop executables to update at your site. Be sure that the KIDS
  install (steps 1-9) are completed before updating the executables (steps
  10-11). The KIDS install will run in under 5 minutes.
   
  Review your mapped set.  If the routines listed in the ROUTINE SUMMARY
  section of the build are mapped, they should be removed from the mapped
  set at this time.
  
   1.  Choose the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu. 
       Answer YES to the prompt 'Want to Continue with Load? YES//'.  This
       will load the KIDS package onto your system.
  
   2.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
       the Installation menu.
  
   3.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options (when
       prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter RMPF*3.0*4):
       a. Backup a Transport Global - this option will create a backup
           message of any routines exported with the patch. It will not
           backup any changes to DD's.
       b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
           allow you to view all changes to routines that will be made 
           when the patch is installed.
       c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will allow you
           to ensure the integrity of the routines that are in the 
           Transport Global.
  
   4.  Then choose the Install Package(s) option and select RMPF*3.0*4.
  
   5.  When prompted "Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install?
       NO//", respond NO (unless otherwise indicated)
  
   6.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, 
       and Protocols? YES//', respond "YES". When prompted to select the
       options you would like to place out of order, enter the following:
            
              ROES3 OPTION ACCESS                  [RMPF ROES3]
  
   7.  If prompted 'Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out of Order': 
       press <return>.
  
   8.  When prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; respond '0.'
  
   9.  If you unmapped routines at the start, those SENT TO SITE
       should be returned to the mapped set once this part of the
       installation is complete.
  
  10.  Retrieve the file RMPF3_0P4.ZIP and extract files ROES3.exe and
       ROES3DeskTop.exe.
  
  11.  All existing instances of ROES3.exe and ROES3DeskTop.exe need to
       be replaced, regardless of whether they reside on server(s) or
       individual workstation(s).
  
       To do this, copy the new executable files to those locations,
       replacing the existing version. Take care NOT to inadvertently
       replace the ROES3.exe file with the ROES3DeskTop.exe file
       or vice versa. When this is completed properly, the command line
       option from CPRS Tools and the desktop links to ROES should continue
       to work without any modifications.
  
  If additional guidance is needed for the GUI installation, please refer
  to the ROES 3 Installation Guide on the System Design and Development 
  web page at:  http://www.domain.ext/vdl. Within the Clinical section look for
  'Remote Order Entry System (ROES)'.  Under that option you will find the
  Installation Guide, Security Guide, Technical Manual and User Manual.
