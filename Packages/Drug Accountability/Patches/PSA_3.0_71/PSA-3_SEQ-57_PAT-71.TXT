 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1.  HD0000000211457 - Locked Invoice
  
   PROBLEM
   ======= 
   Sites are reporting that the invoices are being left in a LOCKED
   VERIFYING status when the user exits ("^") at the "Do you want to
   print the verification error report?" prompt.  The problem is that 
   the routine quits without executing the unlock logic leaving the
   invoice in a locked status.
  
   RESOLUTION
   ==========
   The routine PSAVER will be modified to reset the PSAOUT variable to 0
   after exiting the print routine and after the lock has been cleared.
   Additionally, logic will be added to the PSAVER4 routine to check for
   records in a LOCKED VERIFYING status and give the user the choice to
   reset the status to PROCESSED.
  
   The pre-init routine PSAPRE71 will loop through ^PSD(58.811,"ASTAT,"L"
   global and identify the invoices that have a "LOCKED VERIFYING" status.
   It will send a Mailman message to the PSA NDC UPDATES mail group.  This
   message will contain the Order#, Invoice#,Date the invoice was received
   and the person that verified it.

   ***** End Of Report *****
  
   The 1st time a user identified in the mailman message, uses the
   "Verify Invoices" [PSA VERIFY INVOICES] VistA option, the user will
   see this new prompt:
  
   The following Invoices currently have a status of LOCKED VERIFYING.
   These Invoices are either currently being Verified by you in another
   session, or it may not have completed the Verify process correctly.
  
       Order#: VMP0809300C        Invoice#: VMPDEV080930C  LOCKED VERIFYING
  
    Select one of the following:
  
         P         RESET TO PROCESSED
         C         MARK COMPLETED
         S         SKIP
  
    PROCESS OR COMPLETE:
  
   The user may select "P" RESET TO PROCESSED, "C" MARK COMPLETED or "S" SKIP.
   Once the user has worked all of the locked invoices, they will be removed
   from the list and the user will not see this set of choices again. They will
   only be given the opportunity to mark the invoices as COMPLETED during this
   first session. If the user selects SKIP, that invoice will continue to be
   displayed until the user answer YES to the "Do you want to reset the Order
   Status to PROCESSED? NO//" prompt.
  
   Select OPTION NAME: PSA VERIFY INVOICES       Verify Invoices
  
     The following Invoices currently have a status of LOCKED VERIFYING.
     These Invoices are either currently being Verified by you in another
     session, or it may not have completed the Verify process correctly.
  
     1.   Order#: C502399000         Invoice#: 7229967488
  
     Do you want to reset the Order Status to PROCESSED? NO//
  
   If the user answers 'NO', the record will be left as is.
   If the user answers 'YES', the record status is changed to PROCESSED.
  
     Order Status has been reset to PROCESSED for
        Order#: C502399000 Invoice#: 7229967488
  
  
 2.  HD0000000285500 - Can't received drug (CS) into vault
  
   PROBLEM
   =======
   When an invoice was downloaded and processed by a tech, the quantity
   received was changed to 0 on one item because it was going to be sent
   back.  This was done in error.  It should have been received in and
   then out.  The tech then changed the quantity received to reflect the
   original quantity received - correcting the mistake.  After verifying
   the invoice, the user checked the Controlled Substance package and
   found the drug did not show as being received.
  
   RESOLUTION
   ==========
   The problem is that the routine PSAUTL4 did not detect a difference 
   between a 0 and a null value, treating them as the same, and did not 
   make an update.  The routine will be modified to distinguish between 0
   and null, and send an update if the variable contains anything other
   than nulls.
  
  
 3.  HD0000000322644 - Run away PSA IV ALL LOCATIONS
  
   PROBLEM
   =======
   The DRUG field (#.01) of DRUG sub-file (#58.8001) of the DRUG
   ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8) is a pointer field to the DRUG
   file (#50).  When this field is populated with an alpha-numeric value,
   the PSA IV ALL LOCATIONS [All Location Dispense/Purge] nightly job
   goes into a endless loop and never completes it's processing.
  
   RESOLUTION
   ==========
   Routine PSAVERA1 will be modified to test the drug pointer variable
   against the DRUG file to ensure that it is valid before storing the
   data.
  
   The pre-init routine PSAPRE71 will loop through the DRUG
   ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file at the drug level and remove the
   alphanumeric entries that were created by the bug in PSAVERA1.
   A MailMan message will be sent to the PSA NDC UPDATES mail group 
   with a list of Pharmacy Locations and the bad drug entries that were
   removed.
  
  
 4.  HD0000000279969 - Verifying invoices with blank order unit no longer
                       on discrepancy report
  
   PROBLEM
   =======
   When a drug in the DRUG file (#50) has a blank ORDER UNIT subfield 
   (#9) of the SYNONYM field (#401) and a user is processing an invoice
   for that particular drug, the system does not generate a discrepancy
   report.
  
   RESOLUTION
   ==========
   The routine PSAPROC7 will be modified to check for a null or zero
   value of the ORDER UNIT variable during processing and verification
   for the discrepancy report.
