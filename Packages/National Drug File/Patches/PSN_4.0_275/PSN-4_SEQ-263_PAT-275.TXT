Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is part of NDF Data Update FY11 #6, which is comprised
 of two patches, PSN*4*275 and PSN*4*276.
  
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated with
 the National Drug File (NDF) application.  This patch generates four mail
 messages.  All are sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the NDF DATA mail group,
 holders of the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  The
 first message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP
 ID (if one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the
 national formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched
 from CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has 
 changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists interactions
 that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with the subject DRUGS
 UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file (#50) which
 have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the subject INTERACTIONS and
 ALLERGIES UPDATED, lists interactions and allergies which have been changed
 because they were created with ingredients that are no longer primary
 ingredients.  
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY**
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated
 Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be
 sent to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress,
 examine TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".
