Description:
============

 NOTE: This patch is part of NDF Data Update FY13 #11, which is comprised of two 
 patches, PSN*4*370 and PSN*4*371.
  
 This patch provides updates to data in several of the files associated with the 
 National Drug File (NDF) application.  This patch generates four mail messages. 
  
  
 All are sent from NDF MANAGER to members of the NDF DATA mail group, holders of 
 the PSNMGR security key, and the person installing the patch.  The first 
 message, with the subject DATA UPDATE FOR NDF, lists new products, CMOP ID (if 
 one exists), dispense units, and associated NDCs, products for which the 
 national formulary indicator has changed, products that have been unmatched 
 from CMOP, and products for which the national formulary restriction has 
 changed.  The second, with the subject UPDATED INTERACTIONS, lists interactions 
 that have been added, edited, or inactivated. The third, with the subject DRUGS 
 UNMATCHED FROM NATIONAL DRUG FILE, lists entries in the DRUG file (#50) which 
 have been unmatched from NDF.  The fourth, with the subject INTERACTIONS and 
 ALLERGIES UPDATED, lists interactions and allergies which have been changed 
 because they were created with ingredients that are no longer primary 
 ingredients.  
  
                      **ATTENTION: CMOP SITES ONLY** 
  
 Do not load and install or queue to install this patch while Consolidated Mail 
 Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) prescriptions are being transmitted. If 
 transmissions are in progress, incorrect prescription information may be sent 
 to the CMOP. To determine if a CMOP transmission is in progress, examine 
 TaskMan for jobs entitled "CMOP Data Transmission".

 National Drug File (NDF) and Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) users should be off 
 the system when this patch is installed.  Installation takes less than ten 
 minutes.  This patch should be installed during non-peak requirement hours.  
  
 The environment check routine for this patch checks that the installing person 
 is a valid user, and that the patch has not been installed.

     above.

     the Installation menu.  
  
 3.  From this menu, select the option Load a Distribution and select 
     NDF4P370.KID.  
  
 4.  From this menu, you may choose to use the option Verify Checksums in 
     Transport Global.  When prompted, select PSN*4.0*370. All components of 
     this patch are new, so the option Backup a Transport Global and 
     the option Compare Transport Global to Current System do not have 
     to be invoked.  
  
 5.  Use the Install Package(s) option and select PSN*4.0*370.

     completion of the installation.
