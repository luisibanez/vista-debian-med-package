VistA Patch PSN*4*304 released November 10, 2011 created a new VA drug 
"BLD",8352,1,2,0)
class "AM400 QUINOLONES".  The quinolone antibiotics were previously 
"BLD",8352,1,3,0)
located under VA drug class "AM900 ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER".  Existing
"BLD",8352,1,4,0)
patient allergies in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) to antibiotics 
"BLD",8352,1,5,0)
in the quinolone class were not automatically updated to the new VA drug
"BLD",8352,1,6,0)
classification with the release of PSN*4*304. Consequently the entry of
"BLD",8352,1,7,0)
a new order for an antibiotic in the Quinolone VA drug class will not
"BLD",8352,1,8,0)
trigger a drug allergy alert.
"BLD",8352,1,9,0)
  
"BLD",8352,1,10,0)
A facility reported that the drug-allergy order check in VistA/CPRS did
"BLD",8352,1,11,0)
not trigger appropriately when a patient was ordered a fluroquinolone type
"BLD",8352,1,12,0)
antibiotic that the patient had a known allergy to.  The drug allergy was
"BLD",8352,1,13,0)
properly documented in the VistA Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) System. 
"BLD",8352,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",8352,1,15,0)
This patch contains a post-install routine that will loop through all the
"BLD",8352,1,16,0)
patient allergies entries for quinolones and will correctly update such 
"BLD",8352,1,17,0)
entries with the new class "AM400 QUINOLONES", which should trigger the
"BLD",8352,1,18,0)
drug-allergy order check when the patient is ordered a medication under
"BLD",8352,1,19,0)
this drug class. Once completed, the post-install routine will generate
"BLD",8352,1,20,0)
and send the Mailman message below to the person who installed the patch,
"BLD",8352,1,21,0)
to the mail group 'NDF DATA' and to all the 'PSNMGR' security key holders.
