Associated patches: (v)PSN*4*304   <<= must be installed BEFORE `PSN*4*297'

Subject: DRUG CLASS AM400 (QUINOLONE) ALLERGY FIX

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VistA Patch PSN*4*304 released November 10, 2011 created a new VA drug 
 class "AM400 QUINOLONES".  The quinolone antibiotics were previously 
 located under VA drug class "AM900 ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER".  Existing
 patient allergies in the PATIENT ALLERGIES file (#120.8) to antibiotics 
 in the quinolone class were not automatically updated to the new VA drug
 classification with the release of PSN*4*304. Consequently the entry of
 a new order for an antibiotic in the Quinolone VA drug class will not
 trigger a drug allergy alert.
   
 A facility reported that the drug-allergy order check in VistA/CPRS did
 not trigger appropriately when a patient was ordered a fluroquinolone type
 antibiotic that the patient had a known allergy to.  The drug allergy was
 properly documented in the VistA Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) System. 
  
 This patch contains a post-install routine that will loop through all the
 patient allergies entries for quinolones and will correctly update such 
 entries with the new class "AM400 QUINOLONES", which should trigger the
 drug-allergy order check when the patient is ordered a medication under
 this drug class. Once completed, the post-install routine will generate
 and send the Mailman message below to the person who installed the patch,
 the mail group 'NDF DATA' and all the 'PSNMGR' security key holders.

     From: NDF MANAGER  In 'IN' basket.   Page 1
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Number of Patient Allergy entries by class:
   
     Before update:
     AM900 - ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER: 1601
     AM400 - QUINOLONES           : 11
  
     After update:
     AM900 - ANTI-INFECTIVES,OTHER: 919
     AM400 - QUINOLONES           : 693
  
     Enter message action (in IN basket): Ignore//
  
 The results above will vary from site to site. Some sites might even have
 the exact same numbers 'Before' and 'After' the update, which means the
 site was not affected by the problem in PSN*4*304 when it was installed.
     
 NOTE: Allergy clean up in the past should have converted all allergies
       to a match with an entry from National drug files, however, there 
       might still be some allergies pointing to drug file 50 for example 
       Levofloxacin 500 MG TAB. These entries if present will not convert.
       Separate instructions will be sent to the field for correcting such
       allergies.
