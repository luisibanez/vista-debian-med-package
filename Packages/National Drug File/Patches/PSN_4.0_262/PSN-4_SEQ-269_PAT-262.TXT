Subject: SUPRA-THERAPEUTIC DOSAGES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the New Service Request (NSR) #20070434 to prevent
 the inadvertent creation of supra-therapeutic possible dosages for high
 risk medications during dosage creation performed during the matching and
 rematching of dispense drugs to National Drug File (NDF) entries within
 the Pharmacy Data Management (PDM) V. 1.0 application.
  
 Patch PSN*4*261 has been previously released in preparation for this
 project. It added the following 3 new fields to the VA PRODUCT file
 (#50.68):
  
        CREATE DEFAULT POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40)
        POSSIBLE DOSAGES TO CREATE field (#41)
        PACKAGE field (#42)
  
 Patch PSN*4*262 is being released in conjunction with PDM patch PSS*1*155,
 which has the functionality in place to determine if possible dosages
 should be auto-created or not during the match/re-match process.
  
 This patch contains changes to the Inquire to National Files [PSNACT]
 and Inquire to VA Product Info For Local Drug [PSNLOOK] options to include
 the display of the new fields. Below are some screen captures of how the
 new fields will display to the screen for both options:
  
    Example #1:
          ...
  
          Override DF Exclude from Dosage Checks: No
  
          Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? Yes
  
  
    Example #2:
          ...
          Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? No
              Possible Dosages To Auto-Create: No Possible Dosages
  
  
    Example #3:
          ...
  
          Override DF Exclude from Dosage Checks: No
  
          Auto-Create Default Possible Dosage? No
              Possible Dosages To Auto-Create: 1x and 2x Possible Dosages
                                      Package: Inpatient
  
  
 NOTE: For more information about the new fields, please refer to the patch
       PSN*4*261. For information on how the new fields affect 
       auto-creation of possible dosages during the Match/Rematch 
       process, refer to patch PSS*1*155.
  
 Also, this patch adds the component $$POSDOS to the routine PSNAPIS,
 supported by Integration Control Registration (ICR) #2153, to retrieve the
 content of these 3 new fields.
  
 In addition, a post-install routine will run to update the CREATE DEFAULT
 POSSIBLE DOSAGE field (#40) with the default value of "YES" for entries
 added to the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) after patch PSN*4*261 was installed.
 The post-install routine will be automatically deleted from the system
 upon completion of the installation.
