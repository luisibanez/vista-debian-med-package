This patch contains software modifications to the National Drug File (NDF)
"BLD",7495,1,2,0)
V. 4.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
"BLD",7495,1,3,0)
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
"BLD",7495,1,4,0)
Guide for prescription items that contain FDA approved information that
"BLD",7495,1,5,0)
can help patients avoid adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
"BLD",7495,1,6,0)
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
"BLD",7495,1,7,0)
when the Agency determines that: 
"BLD",7495,1,8,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,9,0)
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
"BLD",7495,1,10,0)
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
"BLD",7495,1,11,0)
   serious side effect with a product, or 
"BLD",7495,1,12,0)
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential
"BLD",7495,1,13,0)
   to its effectiveness. 
"BLD",7495,1,14,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,15,0)
The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
"BLD",7495,1,16,0)
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
"BLD",7495,1,17,0)
features included in this release are:
"BLD",7495,1,18,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,19,0)
 . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within 
"BLD",7495,1,20,0)
   the VA network.
"BLD",7495,1,21,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,22,0)
 . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the 
"BLD",7495,1,23,0)
   corresponding FDA Medication Guide document name will be provided via
"BLD",7495,1,24,0)
   the NDF Monthly Data Update patches.
"BLD",7495,1,25,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,26,0)
 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
"BLD",7495,1,27,0)
   automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
"BLD",7495,1,28,0)
   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
"BLD",7495,1,29,0)
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
"BLD",7495,1,30,0)
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
"BLD",7495,1,31,0)
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
"BLD",7495,1,32,0)
   user via the Internet Explorer browser.

"BLD",7495,1,34,0)
 . Introduction of a new option called Display FDA Medication Guide [PSN MED
"BLD",7495,1,35,0)
   GUIDE] to the National Drug File V. 4.0 application for retrieving and 
"BLD",7495,1,36,0)
   displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific VA Product.
"BLD",7495,1,37,0)
 
"BLD",7495,1,38,0)
 . Introduction of new functionality to the Patient Prescription Processing
"BLD",7495,1,39,0)
   [PSO LM BACKDOOR] option in the Outpatient Pharmacy V. 7.0 application
"BLD",7495,1,40,0)
   for retrieving and displaying the FDA Medication Guide for a specific

  2) When doing a copy/paste of the link into the browser's address and an HTTP
"BLD",7495,1,130,0)
     404 - File Not Found error is received. This may be due to the following:
"BLD",7495,1,131,0)
     - A common issue exists when the link is displayed in two lines in the
"BLD",7495,1,132,0)

       into the browser's address, the second line is ignored by the browser
"BLD",7495,1,134,0)
       resulting in a 'broken' link. To resolve this issue, copy and paste one
"BLD",7495,1,135,0)

     field will now be used to store only the PDF file name of the FDA  
"BLD",7495,1,183,0)
     Medication Guide rather than the complete link, which also had the web
"BLD",7495,1,184,0)

This patch contains software modifications to the National Drug File (NDF)
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,2,0)
V. 4.0 application to support the FDA Medication Guides project. The 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,3,0)
project objective is to allow pharmacy staff to retrieve the FDA Medication 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,4,0)
Guide for prescription items that contain FDA approved information that
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,5,0)
can help patients avoid adverse events. The FDA requires that Medication
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,6,0)
Guides be included with certain prescribed drugs and biological products 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,7,0)
when the Agency determines that: 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,8,0)
 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,9,0)
 . Certain information is necessary to prevent serious adverse effects 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,10,0)
 . Patient decision-making should be advised by information about a known
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,11,0)
   serious side effect with a product, or 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,12,0)
 . Patient adherence to directions for the use of a product is essential

The features in the FDA Medication Guides project are being delivered in
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,16,0)
incremental releases. This patch is part of the Increment 2 release. The 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,17,0)
features included in this release are:
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,18,0)
 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,19,0)
 . Establishment of a Server Repository for FDA Medication Guides within

   the VA network.
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,21,0)
 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,22,0)
 . Updates to 900+ entries in the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68) to store the

 . Introduction of a PC based Java software component to enable the
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,27,0)
   automatic retrieval of an FDA Medication Guide from within VistA. The
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,28,0)
   software does not require any direct user interaction. It works as a 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,29,0)
   bridge between VistA and the PC where it is installed. The software 
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,30,0)
   identifies a request from VistA for a specific FDA Medication Guide and
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,31,0)
   automatically retrieves it from the Server Repository and displays to the
"PKG",136,22,1,"PAH",1,1,32,0)
