Subject: DATA UPDATE - PPSN NDC MIGRATION PATCH

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 Patch PSN*4*339 is a onetime migration patch, that consists of NDC 
 updates to NDC/UPN file (#50.67). This patch will transition The National
 Drug File Management system to the Pharmacy Product System National
 (PPSN). PPSN will convert the manually maintained NDC/UPN file to a system
 that is supported by a commercial vendor.
  
 This patch will add new NDC data but will not make changes to the VA 
 product file. There should not be any unmatched entries for the VA 
 Pharmacy ADPAC to rematch. 
  
 This patch will generate four e-mail messages but the messages should not 
 contain any data that the Pharmacy ADPAC will need to act on. But due to 
 system design the patch will send the following patch messages. Only the
 allergies update message will contain any data. Edits to the CS federal 
 schedule on many VA Products is causing the NDF system to update the
 ingredient list of patient's. Edits from a non-primary to a primary
 ingredient will fix the underlying allergy for these patient's.

 Update, contact NDF Support at VHAPBH NDF in MS Outlook.
