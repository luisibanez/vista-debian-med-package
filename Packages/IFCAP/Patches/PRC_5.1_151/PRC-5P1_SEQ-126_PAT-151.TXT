Description:
============

  
 In patch PRC*5.1*148 the 1358 form in IFCAP was modified to require 
 users to select the Authority and Sub-authority (where applicable) and 
 to enter a Service Start Date and a Service End Date.  This patch 
 updates the F20 Control Point Activity file (#410) extract to include 
 the new fields.  The Control Point Activity - F20 file extract is one of
 the 23 Clinical Logistics Report Server (CLRS) extracts produced by
 running the option, CLO Procurement Reports (CLRS) [PRCHLO CLO
 PROCUREMENT].
  
 The 8 data elements are added in order starting with the 70th piece:
     70 Authority IEN (internal value of field #19 in 410 record)
     71 Authority Code (external value of field #19 in 410 record)  
     72 Authority Description (external value of field #.02 in 19:410.9)
     73 Sub-Authority IEN (internal value of field #19.1 in file 410)
     74 Sub-Authority Code (external value of field #19.1 in file 410) 
     75 Sub-Authority Description (external value of field #.02 in 19.1:410.9)
     76 Service Start Date (field #6 in 410 record)
     77 Service End Date (field #6.5 in 410 record)
  
 This patch also adds the fields to the Control Point Activity CLRS 
 Extract Validation Template, PRCHLO410_HDR_VALIDATE. This template is 
 used to view in IFCAP data from file #410 and referenced files
 corresponding to data extracted from the Control Point Activity - F20 
 extract.
  
 The security key, PRCSOBL, is deleted in this patch. The option the key
 locked (Obligation Data) was removed in PRC*5.1*148.
