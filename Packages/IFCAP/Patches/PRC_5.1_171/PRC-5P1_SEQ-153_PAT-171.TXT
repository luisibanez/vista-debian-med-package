 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. INC000000625911
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using option Distribution Order Processing [PRCP DIST ORDER 
    PROCESSING]the user is able to add/edit items on order.  Displaying
    items to add will create scrolling overwrite when using action
    Enter/Edit Inventory Items.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify process flow to clear screen protect when moving from Listman 
    screen for Distribution Order Processing [PRCP DIST ORDER PROCESSING]
    option to Listman screen for action Enter/Edit Inventory Items, and
    same screen clearing when returning from latter to former.
  
    Routines: PRCPEILM, PRCPOPL
  
 2. INC000000585098
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The Control Point official uses this option to add or delete staff who 
    will be allowed to Request, Initiate and/or Approve orders for a Fund 
    Control Point. However, each user assigned should have a valid
    Delegation of Authority MEMO.  A new fiscal audit has identified users
    not having this MEMO.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Delete the option 'Enter/Edit Control Point Users' [PRCSCPU] used by
    Budget Analysts to assign staff power to the Fund Control Points.  This
    will insure the staff assignment to Fund Control Points will be a
    function of the Fiscal staff ONLY.

    Problem:
    --------
    Site reported that Enter Delivery Order [PRCH ENTER DELIVERY ORDER] 
    option will show as obligated on Running Balance report even with auto

    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify the option Enter Delivery Order [PRCH ENTER DELIVERY ORDER] 
    creation processing to not auto obligate the order unless the EDI or
    All/Delivery switch is turned on for Fund Control Point or entire site.
