 Patch Overview
 ==================================================
  
 This patch introduces changes and enhancements to the Integrated Funds
 Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP)
 V. 5.1 package in support of the Miscellaneous Obligations Enhancements
 project. 
  
 A new interface is being established between the IFCAP application and
 the Online Certification System (OLCS) located at the Financial Services
 Center (FSC) in Austin, Texas.  The interface will support the validation
 of the Certifier of Payment role in the OLCS.
  
 The interface will be a one-way data exchange of Miscellaneous Obligations
 1358 data from the IFCAP application to the OLCS.  The electronic exchange
 of 1358 data between the IFCAP application and OLCS will use VistA MailMan
 messages. The mail messages will provide OLCS with the requestor,
 approver, and obligator for each 1358 obligated or adjusted in IFCAP to
 enforce segregation of duties in OLCS.  Segregation of duties prevents a
 user from functioning in more than one role on a 1358.  The OLCS will
 verify that a certifier processing an invoice for a 1358 in OLCS is not
 the requestor, approver, or obligator on that 1358 in IFCAP.
  
 The following IFCAP events will trigger a MailMan message from the local
 site to the Online Certification System:
  
   * OBLIGATION event - when a new 1358 transaction is obligated in IFCAP
   * ADJUSTMENT event - when an increase/decrease adjustment transaction is
                        obligated in IFCAP
  
 During the installation of this patch, a job will be automatically queued 
 to perform an initial data extract of 1358 transactions for Fiscal Year
 2010 and Fiscal Year 2011.  These 1358 transaction records will be
 transmitted to the OLCS via VistA MailMan batch messages (100 transaction 
 records per batch) and be used to seed their database.
  
 The exchange of Miscellaneous Obligations 1358 data from the IFCAP 
 application to the Online Certification System will occur in the
 background and be transparent to IFCAP end-users.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
  
   * 20080801 - Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities   
                for 1358 Misc Obligations
  
          Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
          Misc Obligations: Implements adequate controls with respect to 
          segregation of duties and oversight by contracting officials,
          improving documentation requirements, and enhancing 1358
          reporting capabilities within Integrated Funds Distribution,
          Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) that
          will be used at the station, Veterans Integrated Service Network
          (VISN), and enterprise levels.  A Government Accountability
          Office (GAO) review questioned VHA's internal control standards
          governing the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations
          as well as oversight abilities. Direction by the Congressional
          Oversight Committee of the House.  GAO Report - GAO-08-1056T

 Patch Installation
 ==================================================
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
  This patch includes an environment check (ENV^PRC153P) that will ensure 
  the following requirements are satisfied prior to patch installation:
  
   1. Programmer access is required for installing this patch.  Prior to
      installation, the installer must ensure the DUZ(0) node of the DUZ 
      array is set to the "@" symbol.
  
   2. The DOMAIN (#4.2) file entry "Q-OLP.MED.VA.GOV" is required for 
      installing this patch. Prior to installation, the installer must
      ensure the DOMAIN (#4.2) file entry "Q-OLP.MED.VA.GOV" was added per
      instructions provided by MailMan patch XM*999*175.  The installation
      of the software distribution will be aborted if the domain entry is 
      not found.
  
  
  This patch has no pre-installation items.
  
  
  This patch includes a post-installation (POST^PRC153P) that will perform
  the following actions:
  
   1. Automatically add the installer as a member of the new 'OLP' mail
      group in the Mail Group (#3.8) file.
  
   2. Automatically queue a job that will perform an initial data extract
      of 1358 transactions for Fiscal Year 2010 and Fiscal Year 2011.
      These 1358 transaction records will be transmitted to the Online
      Certification System via MailMan messages. The following 1358
      transaction types will be extracted and sent to OLCS:
  
       a. Initial Obligation (when a 1358 is obligated in IFCAP)
       b. Adjustment (increase/decrease to the 1358 obligated in IFCAP)
  
   3. Once the job responsible for performing an initial data extract of 
      1358 transactions for Fiscal Year 2010 and Fiscal Year 2011
      completes, a MailMan message will be sent to the installer containing
      results for the extract.
