 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 HD0000000236529  Amendment to decrease line item quantity to less than
                  Delivery Schedule
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Whenever an amendment to an order involving the delivery schedule is done,
 if the order quantity is changed the system will not allow any changes to
 the Delivery Schedule when required.  It scrolls repeated notations to
 edit Delivery Schedule, but the user is never given edit capabilities.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify template [PRCHLINE] (after DD change to remove the
 write access block to the Federal Supply Classification field (#8)),
 in the ITEM SUB-FILE (#443.61) of the AMENDMENTS file (#443.6).
  
 And, corrections for uncovered problems when Delivery Schedule could be
 accessed once repetitive error message was corrected:
  
 A. Modify template [PRCHLINE] to allow for valid checking (after a 
    Delivery Schedule is updated for decreased quantity) when there has
    been a prior receipt against item.
  
 B. Modify template [PRCHLINE] for option [AMENDMENT TO PURCHASE ORDER]
    option [PRCHLINE] and template [PRCH2138] for option [NEW PURCHASE
    ORDER] option to allow NEW delivery schedules to be added per the
    displayed instructions.
  
 C. Modify templates [PRCHNREQ] and [PRCHRQITEM] for Delivery Schedule 
    processing corrections.
  
 D. DD change to remove the write access block to the Federal Supply
    Classification field (#8)), in the ITEM SUB-FILE (#442.01) of the
    PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS file (#442).
