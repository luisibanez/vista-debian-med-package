Subject: SPD - SPECIAL INV POINT TYPE;ARCHIVING PROBLEM;INVALID GLOBAL REFERENCED

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Integrated sites cannot have two primary SPD (Supply Processing & 
    Distribution) inventory points as system currently allows only one
    flagged SPD primary at a time. This prevents use of the 
    Case Cart/Instrument kit system at more than one site.
  
 2. The end of year IFCAP Archive/Purging process will archive all selected
    orders for the prior fiscal years to a document file.  However, it was
    discovered that 1358 orders for a certain year would copy totally  
    different order information for a different order and a different year.
  
 3. When editing a request and modifying the Inventory Point the new 
    Inventory Point would be stored in global ^PRC(410) (does not exist) 
    instead of ^PRCS(410).

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000056867 SPD - Special Inventory Point Type
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Integrated site is not allowed to setup more than one Primary Inventory 
 Point as a Special Inventory Point Type of SPD.  This prevents site from 
 using more than one Case Cart/Instrument Kit where they would need
 2 or more SPD primaries.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The resolution to this site problem was to open up the Special Inventory
 Point Type to allow more than one SPD entry for multiple Primary 
 Inventory Points.  This has been done by modifying field SPECIAL INVENTORY
 POINT TYPE (#15) in file GENERIC INVENTORY (#445) .
  
  
 Routines: none
  
  
  
 2. HD0000000422778 Problem with IFCAP Archive option
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site noticed that when using option [Archive Selectable Records] built 
 from finding archivable records, that at times records being archived
 reflect current years data when they were only archiving year 2003 and
 older.
  
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Found that the coding in routine PRCGARC1 had too many uses of variable
 DA which eventually caused confusion when archiving 1358s where an 
 entirely different 410 - CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY record would be used for
 the basis of the selected 1358 to print.
  
  
 Routines:  PRCGARC1
  
  
  
 3. HD0000000414834 Routine references ^PRC(410 rather than ^PRCS(410
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Found that an undefined file ^PRC(410,ien... was being set at site when
 field Inventory Point was modified in option Edit a Request (Section).
  
   
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 Modified routine PRCSEA to set the new Inventory Point into correct file
 ^PRCS(410,ien...
  
 A post-install routine is included (PRCG147P) that will save the invalid 
 file to ^XTMP("PRCG147P") for 120 days and kill invalid file ^PRC(410,...
  
  
 Routines:  PRCSEA,PRCG147P
