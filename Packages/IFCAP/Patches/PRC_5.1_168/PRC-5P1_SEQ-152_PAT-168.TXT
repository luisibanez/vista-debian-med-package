 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000526836 cannot print 1358
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option Display/Print 1358 [PRCEF DISPLAY/PRINT 1358] will print
    the transaction activity for a 1358 out of sequence when the
    transaction sequence numbers exceed 999.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify compile/print for 1358 activity to handle leading zeros for 
    transaction numbers to correct transaction sequencing issue.

 2. INC000000605061 PRCFA SUPERVISOR key not being removed when user
                    deactivated
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Security key PRCFA SUPERVISOR 'KEEP AT TERMINATE' setting is currently
    set to 'YES' to ensure key is kept when user is terminated.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    1. A post install routine will set security key PRCFA SUPERVISOR
       'KEEP AT TERMINATE' setting found in SECURITY KEY (#19.1) file to
       'NO'.
    2. The post install routine will remove the PRCFA SUPERVIOR key from
       any terminated employees in the NEW PERSON (#200) file.
    3. The post install routine will also create an audit of all active
       Employee holders of the PRCFA SUPERVISOR key which will be stored in
       a temporary file ^XTMP("PRC168P") for 4 months.
  
  
 **** The post install routine is covered by ICR 5899 for NEW PERSON 
 **** (#200) file and ICR 5900 for SECURITY KEY (#19.1) file.
