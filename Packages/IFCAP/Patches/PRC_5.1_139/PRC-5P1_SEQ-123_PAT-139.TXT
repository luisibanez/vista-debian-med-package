Subject: CLRS DATA ISSUE;CEILING TRANSACTIONS OUT OF NUMBERS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

  This patch will address the following issues:
   
  1. Duplicate feeds of Clinical Logistics Report Server (CLRS) data to
     Austin when testing on the test/mirror account.
   
  2. Ceiling transactions out of numbers

  2. HD0000000352359 Ceiling transactions out of numbers

  Remedy Overview:
  ================ 
  1. HD0000000294822 CLRS data issue
   
  Problem:
  --------
  There can be transmission of CLRS data to Austin when testing on the
  test/mirror account.  Since the test account is a copy of the production
  account, the transmitted data is a duplicate of data that was previously
  sent from the production account.  The application needs a processing
  control to check for being run from a test/mirror account and not allow
  the CLRS data transmission.
   
   
  Resolution:
  -----------
  Routine PRCHLO5 was modified to check for test/mirror account and prevent 
  the actual transmission of data when running the CLRS data transmission
  option.  In addition a MailMan message will be sent to the user informing
  them of the 'not sent' status. 
  
   
  Routines: PRCHLO5
   
   
  2. HD0000000352359 Ceiling transactions out of numbers
   
  Problem:
  -------
  Sites needs to process Ceiling Transactions but they have reached the 
  maximum transaction sequence numbering allowed (9999).
   
   
  Resolution:
  ----------                    
  Several routines were modified to allow 99,999 maximum transactions.  The
  following options were affected:
            Add New Transaction (Ceiling)
            Edit Existing, Unreleased Transaction
            Delete Unreleased Transaction
            Transfer From/To Control Point
            Release Transaction
   
  A data dictionary change was made to the TRANSACTION NUMBER field (#.01)
  in the FUND DISTRIBUTION file [#421] to account for 99,999 transaction
  numbers.
   
  A post-install routine is included (PRCB139P) to modify fiscal years 
  2001-2011 four digit transaction number up to the new 5 digit standard.
  The converted transaction numbers will be stored in temporary global
  ^XTMP("PRCB139P") for four months.
   
   
  Routines: PRCB139P, PRCBE, PRCBP, PRCBR, PRCBR1, PRCFSITE
