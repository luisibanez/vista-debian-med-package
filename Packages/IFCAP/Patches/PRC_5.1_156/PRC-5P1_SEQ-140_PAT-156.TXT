 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000451181 - FCP636 system is duplicating some orders entered
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When site runs option 'Convert a Temporary 2237 request into a Purchase
    Card Order', the temporary transaction is not removed from the Running 
    Balance report.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the order processing option for 'Convert a Temporary 2237
    Request into a Purchase Card Order' to delete the temporary transaction
    from the Running Balance index.
  
    ** A post install process will run to remove any duplicate Running
    Balance transactions created by this error condition. Example of post 
    install output:
  
    Running Post-Install Routine: FIX410^PRCS156P.
  
    NUMBER IEN 'RB' MISMATCHES: 3
  
    ** Temporary work file of deleted 'RB' duplicates is kept for 120 days 
       in ^XTMP("PRCS156")
  
    Routines: PRCHCON1, PRCS156P
  
  
 2. HD0000000433365 - Purchase Order issue for BBFY
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reports that when dating a Purchase Order for the succeeding
    fiscal year, the Purchase Order link requisition will default back to
    the current year.  This affects the Running Balance reporting and the
    order will be rejected by FMS in the succeeding fiscal year as being a
    previous fiscal year order.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modified routine PRCOEDC to insure that the following fiscal year
    (BBFY) is not reset to current fiscal year.
