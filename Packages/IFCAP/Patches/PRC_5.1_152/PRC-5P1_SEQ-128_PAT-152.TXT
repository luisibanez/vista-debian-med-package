Subject: 1358 MISC. OBLIG. - FEE BASIS APIS

Category: 
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This enhancement patch introduces two new application program interfaces
 (APIs) that provide information on 1358 miscellaneous obligations.  The
 Fee Basis application will call these APIs to enforce and report on
 segregation of duties for the Certifier of a Fee payment batch. Per
 segregation of duties a Certifier cannot have previously acted in the role
 of Requestor, Approver or Obligator on the 1358 miscellaneous obligation
 that is linked to the payment batch.
  
 This patch does not modify any IFCAP options or processes.
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20080801 Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
          Misc Obligations: Implements adequate controls with respect to 
          segregation of duties and oversight by contracting officials,
          improving documentation requirements, and enhancing 1358
          reporting capabilities within Integrated Funds Distribution,
          Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) that
          will be used at the station, Veterans Integrated Service Network
          (VISN), and enterprise levels.  A Government Accountability
          Office (GAO) review questioned VHA's internal control standards
          governing the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations
          as well as oversight abilities. Direction by the Congressional
          Oversight Committee of the House.  GAO Report - GAO-08-1056T
          Improvements Needed in Design of Controls over Miscellaneous 
          Obligations, July 31, 2008.  Department of Veterans Affairs
          Memorandum, Interim Memos (Interim Guidance on Miscellaneous
          Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated January 30, 2008 AND

          Processing of Miscellaneous Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated
          May 18, 2008.
  
  
 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1. ADD NEW API UOKCERT^PRCEMOA()
            
    This API verifies that the person would not violate segregation of duty
    when certifying an invoice associated with a 1358 miscellaneous
    obligation by ensuring that they have not previously acted as a
    requestor, approver, or obligator on that 1358.  This new API is
    documented by integration agreement #5573.
  
    An adjustment (increase/decrease) to a 1358 miscellaneous obligation
    will only impact the API results if that adjustment has been obligated
    by the accounting technician.
  
  
 2. ADD NEW API $$EV1358^PRCEMOA()
  
    This API provides information on the events (initial obligation and
    increase/decrease adjustments) and IFCAP actors (requestor, approving
    official, obligator) for a specified 1358 miscellaneous obligation.
    This new API is documented by integration agreement #5574.
