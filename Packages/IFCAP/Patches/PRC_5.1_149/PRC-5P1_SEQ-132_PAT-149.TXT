Subject: FINAL CHARGE CONFLICT;CARRY FORWARD TIME ELAPSE ISSUE;UNPAID PC TX REPORT ERROR

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Site found that during Reconciliation processing it was possible to 
    mark more than one charge as 'FINAL CHARGE' which should not be 
    allowed as it causes the Approving Official to be delinquent on the
    Delinquent Approval Report.
       
 2. Site reports that Carry Forward processing takes a long time and 
    purchase order finalization through Prosthetics GUI will time out    
    without completing the order processing.
                                        
 3. Site reports that running 'Summary report of Unpaid Purchase Card 
    Transactions' under LINUX OS (print queuing is required) results in
    system error.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000427055 Multiple Final Charge check not working for 
                    reconciliation
  
    Problem:
    --------
    During reconciliation processing (original charge or editing) the check
    to ensure an order cannot have multiple charges flagged as FINAL CHARGE
    is not working.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modified routine PRCIREC to check for a previous reconciliation charge 
    flagged as final charge and not allow user to flag a second charge as 
    final.
  
    Routines: PRCIREC
  
  
 2. HD0000000397975 Carry forward taking long time, with undefined error
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Site reports that running option Carry Forward takes approximately
    3 hours instead of 5-10 minutes.  Also, Prosthetics reported that when
    signing the Purchase Order in their GUI processing the filing is very 
    slow or not filed at all.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modified routine PRCSUT3 to handle zero node internal number counter
    for File CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) for rogue internal checking and
    bogus temporary transactions cross reference not removed from "B" index
    when transaction number changed.  Processing will attempt to reset the
    internal number counter to the next sequential number based on site's 
    file history.
  
    Also, a pre-install processing will occur to clean up the 'B' cross 
    reference index in file #410.  These bogus entries are leftover when a 
    temporary transaction is changed to a valid transaction and the
    temporary transaction name was not removed from the 'B' index. The
    purged data will be kept for 120 days in the temporary work file
    ^XTMP("PRCS149P").
  
    Routines: PRCSUT3, PRCS149P
  
    NOTE:  Routine PRCS149P is automatically deleted after the successful 
    installation of the patch.
  
 3. HD0000000457625 Undefined error when queuing to print report 'Summary 
                    of Unpaid PC Transactions'
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When running report 'Summary Report of Unpaid PC Transactions' under 
    LINUX OS the report must be queued and an undefined error occurred when
    report queued.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modified routine PRCHRP3 to ensure the variable NOTASK is passed to the
    queued report task.
  
    Routines: PRCHRP3
