Subject: MODIFICATION TO REMOVE MISCELLANEOUS FROM 1358 DOCUMENT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Print Template
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Sort Template
  - Data Dictionary

Description:
============

 As part of the 1358 Segregation of Duties initiative, the word 
 "Miscellaneous" and its abbreviation "Misc." are being removed from 
 references to the 1358 Obligation in screen displays, printouts, help 
 text, templates and VistA manuals.  Headers for screen display and
 printout will now show 1358, the Authority description and the
 Sub-Authority description instead of the phrase "MISCELLANEOUS
 OBLIGATION".  The value of entry #21's NAME field (#.01) in the PAT TYPE
 file (#442.5), which was "MISC.OBLIGATION (1358)", now will be "1358
 OBLIGATION".  In addition, on forms the Authority and Sub-Authority Codes
 will now display on the same line followed by the Service Start Date and
 Service End Date on the next line.
  
 In addition, this patch also includes the following changes.  In fields
 END DATE FOR 1358 (#33) and AUTO ACCRUE (#34) of the Control Point
 Activity file (#410) the "Miscellaneous" references are removed and the
 misspellings of words accrue, accrued, and accrual are corrected.  Print
 Template PRCS1358 FORM PRINT for the Procurement & Accounting Transactions
 file (#442) is deleted from the database as it was determined that this
 template has serious logic errors and that it is apparently not referenced
 by currently functional IFCAP application code.

 Description of Changes:
  This is the Post-Init routine for patch PRC*5.1*158 and it is

  Via a FILE^DIE call, it files "1358 OBLIGATION" into the #.01 field of
