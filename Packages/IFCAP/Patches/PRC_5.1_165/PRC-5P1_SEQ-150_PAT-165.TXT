 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000532370 Items falling below emergency stock level are not 
                    showing up on Auto-Gen orders 
  
    Problem:
    --------
    During the auto generation of repetitive orders, those items compiled
    that have no vendor contract number associated will not be pulled into
    the subsequent Delivery Order created for Vendor/items.
                                                          
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine used in then Create Delivery Order From Repetitive Item
    List option [PRCH CREATE DEL ORDER] to list the items that will not be
    pulled into the Vendor Delivery Order due to a missing Vendor contract 
    number. The user creating the order will be queried to proceed with the
    order if there are additional items as part of order.
  
    For example:
  
 Select REPETITIVE ITEM LIST ENTRY NUMBER: 656-12-1-042-828100-0004  
 # OF ITEMS: 2                                        TOTAL COST:    666.02
 This repetitive item list has the following vendors:
  
 KREISERS, INC.                          NUMBER: 9696
  
  
 Excluded item(s) with no vendor contract#: 
  
     22980   SET,IV ADMIN,PUMP,MEDLEY,NEEDL    QTY= 2       COST:     1.00
  
 Do you wish to continue with this order excluding the above item(s)? No//

 2. HD0000000519557 Amendment problem - not authorized to amend
  
    Problem:
    --------
    A user that created an order left the VA so the site staff made another
    user a surrogate on the original user's purchase card.  However 
    they selected a user with a similar name as the original user.  This 
    prevented the intended user from amending the order as they were not 
    listed as a purchase card surrogate, but did have access to the Fund 
    Control Point associated with the purchase card. 
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine used by option Purchase Card Registration [PRCH CARD
    REGISTRATION] to insure that a surrogate added to a Purchase Card has
    access to the Fund Control Point associated with the Purchase Card.

               DESCRIPTION:      A user who has the ability to act as a
                                 surrogate for the card holder.  
  
               TECHNICAL DESCR:  The surrogate MUST have access to the FCP
                                 linked to the Purchase Card.

 3. HD0000000592857 User encountered subscript error while running option 
                    APPROVE REQUESTS'.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The user received a subscript error while running option 'APPROVE
    REQUESTS' when not choosing a valid site from multiple site list. 
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine to insure a user that is linked to multiple sites 
    within FUND CONTROL POINT File (#420) selects one of the sites
    displayed.  If user simply hits return they will get the following 
    error message:
  
    Select STATION NUMBER: 
    Please select site
