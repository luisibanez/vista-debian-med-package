 In support of the requirement to implement Segregation of Duties within the 
 1358 module in IFCAP, new functionality is being introduced with this patch.
  
  
 This patch addresses the following New Service Request (NSR):
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 20080801 Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
          Misc Obligations: Implements adequate controls with respect to 
          segregation of duties and oversight by contracting officials,
          improving documentation requirements, and enhancing 1358
          reporting capabilities within Integrated Funds Distribution,
          Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) that
          will be used at the station, Veterans Integrated Service Network
          (VISN), and enterprise levels.  A Government Accountability
          Office (GAO) review questioned VHA's internal control standards
          governing the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations
          as well as oversight abilities. Direction by the Congressional
          Oversight Committee of the House.  GAO Report - GAO-08-1056T
          Improvements Needed in Design of Controls over Miscellaneous 
          Obligations, July 31, 2008.  Department of Veterans Affairs
          Memorandum, Interim Memos (Interim Guidance on Miscellaneous
          Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated January 30, 2008 AND
          Department of Veterans Affairs Memorandum, Revised Guidance for
          Processing of Miscellaneous Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated
          May 18, 2008.
  
  
 The changes made by this patch are described below:
  
 1. ENFORCE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES ON 1358
 ----------------------------------------
 This patch modifies IFCAP to enforce segregation of duties.
  
    1A. REQUESTOR VALUE ON 1358 MAINTAINED BY SOFTWARE
        This patch modifies IFCAP to automatically set the REQUESTOR field
        equal to the current user instead of prompting for a REQUESTOR when
        a 1358 obligation or 1358 adjustment is entered or edited.
  
        The software will warn a control point official and allow them to
        stop before being automatically set as the REQUESTOR on a 1358.
        The warning is similar to the following:
  
          WARNING: The system will assign you as the CP Clerk (Requestor)
          of this 1358. You will be unable to approve a 1358 on which you
          are the REQUESTOR due to segregation of duties.
          Do you want to proceed (Y/N)? NO//
  
        These modifications do not apply to 1358s with a temporary
        transaction number.  However, once a 1358 transaction is given a
        permanent number, the REQUESTOR field is maintained by the
        software.
  
       The following options have been modified with these changes:
         New 1358 Request [PRCEC NEW]
         Increase/Decrease Adjustment [PRCEC ADJUST]
         Copy a Transaction [PRCSECP]  (only when 1358)
         Edit 1358 Request [PRCEC EDIT]
         Change Existing Transaction Number [PRCSANTN] (only when 1358)
  
  
    1B. ENFORCE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES FOR APPROVING OFFICAL
        After this patch is installed, the software will not allow a user
        to act as the approving official on a 1358 transaction if they are
        the requestor on that transaction.
  
  
    1C. ENFORCE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES FOR OBLIGATOR
        After this patch is installed, the software will not allow a user
        to obligate a 1358 transaction if they are the requestor or 
        approving official on that transaction.
  
 2. NEW FIELDS AND REQUIRED FIELDS
 ---------------------------------
 To record justification for use of the 1358 obligation form users will be
 required to select a 1358 Authority and Sub-Authority (where applicable)
 prior to creation of the 1358 document.  The Authorities are being
 nationally distributed and are not to be edited locally.  The list of

 To enhance requirement of data, two additional required fields are being
 added to the 1358 creation process.  The fields are Service Start Date and
 Service End Date.  Also the Purpose field is now being mandated for all
 original 1358s and adjustments to 1358s.  Vendor and Contract are being
 made conditionally mandatory based on the Authority selected.
  
 The 1358 form in IFCAP is being revised to accommodate the new fields 
 Authority (Code and Text), Sub-authority (Code and text), Service Start 
 Date and Service End Date.
  
 Prior to a 1358 being flagged for approval or being allowed to be 
 approved, the new mandatory fields are reviewed and verified for 
 completion.  If they are not complete the document will not be allowed to 
 move forward in the approval process.
  
 The following options, reports and displays are being enhanced to support 
 the new fields Authority, Sub-Authority, Service Start Date and Service 
 End Date: 
      New 1358 Request [PRCEC NEW]
      Edit 1358 Request [PRCEC EDIT]
      Print 1358 [PRCEC PRINT 1358]
      Print Obligated 1358s [PRCEC PRINT PO FROM 1358]
      Approve Requests [PRCSAPP]
      Obligate 1358 [PRCEF OBLIGATE]
      Display/Print 1358 [PRCEF DISPLAY/PRINT 1358]
      Register by Day [PRCHOUT PO REG/DAY]
  
  
 3.  ADD AUTHORITY/SUB-AUTHORITY CODE TO 1358's SO CODE SHEET SENT TO FMS
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After this patch is installed when a new 1358 is obligated, the code of
 the authority/sub-authority under which the 1358 was created will be sent
 in the 13th piece of the MO2 segment of the SO code sheet generated for
 that 1358 obligation.  The authority/sub-authority codes will also be sent
 in SO modification documents for increase/ decrease adjustments
 subsequently created for that 1358.
  
  
 4.  DELETE MISSING FIELDS REPORT (1358)
 ---------------------------------------
 Installation of this patch deletes the Missing Fields Report (1358), It
 has been identified that absence of a specified vendor or contract data
 could be justifiable and not a violation of policy/regulation. This patch
 has controlled the edit process thereby making the Missing Fields Report
 (1358) [PRC 1358 MISSING FIELDS] no longer needed.
  
  
 5.  REMOVE OBLIGATION DATA [PRCSENOD] OPTION
 --------------------------------------------
 Installation of this patch deletes the Obligation Data [PRCSENOD] 
 option.  The option was determined to no longer being used and would have 
 not enforced separation of duties.

 Description of Changes:
  This routine is used to change an existing transaction number. It was
  modified to warn a control point official and allow them to stop when
  changing a 1358.  Lock time-outs were changed.  The requestor value is now
  automatically set for a 1358.  An existing problem was corrected for
  temporary transaction numbers where the specified inventory distribution
  point was not being saved.
