Subject: TASKED OPTION;INVOICE ADDRESS;ROUTINE SACC VIOLATION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Input Template

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following 3 issues:
  
 1. When using Taskman to run the Inactivate Expired Charge Cards [PRCH 
    INACTIVATE EXP CHAR CARD] option, the system is not changing the status
    to inactive.
  
 2. Option, New Purchase Order [PRCHPC PO ADD], must have query INVOICE 
    ADDRESS default 'FMS' changed to "VA FSC'.
  
 3. Routine PRCHNPO6 is not in compliance with SACC (VistA Programming 
    Standards and Conventions) since lock ':0' is less than the value of
    the Kernel variable "DILOCKTM".

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000289276 Tasking option 'Inactivate Expired Charge Cards' not 
                    working
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When users use the Schedule/Unschedule option via Taskman, Expired 
 Purchase Charge Cards are not being inactivated when they should be.   
 This is happening because processing quits with no action as there 
 is a query for STATION when tasked.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ---------------
 Modify processing logic to skip STATION query when option is tasked to
 begin card logic checking for expired/terminated cards.
  
  
 Routines: PRCH3A
  
  
 2. HD0000000244695 Issue with Invoice Address default
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 The default for Invoice Address is 'FMS' and should be 'VA FSC'. 
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify the default for Invoice Address to 'VA FSC' in the following input 
 templates:  PRCH2138
             PRCHSIMP
             PRCH DETAILED PURCHASE CARD

 Routines: PRCHNPO6 
  
 3. HD0000000364830 VistA SACC violation in routine PRCHNPO6
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Locking code in routine PRCHNPO6 at tag EN8+3 is not in compliance with
 VistA SACC due to the incremental lock time out of 0 (zero) being less 
 than DILOCKTM.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 2.4.6   LOCK Command
  
 2.4.6.1 All LOCKs shall be of the incremental form. (Exemption: Kernel)
  
 All incremental LOCKS must have a timeout, the timeout must not 
 be less than the value of the Kernel variable "DILOCKTM".
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify lock timeout to use variable DILOCKTM, if defined, or 3 or 5 
 seconds depending on the lock changed.
