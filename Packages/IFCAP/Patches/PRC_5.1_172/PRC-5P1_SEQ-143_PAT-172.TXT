      ****************  NOTE  ****************
  
 Below are the revised patch instructions with the Linux notes added.
  
 Updated from 
 PRC*5.1*83 SEQ #79.
  
   
 Pre-Installation Overview
 -------------------------
   
 The Pre Installation Instructions detail how the System Manager is to 
 create the extract directory for the CLRS. The extract directory will
 temporarily contain the station-level data that will be transferred to
 the CLRS during the FTP process.  
   
 Post Installation Overview
 --------------------------
   
 The Post Installation Instructions specify how to schedule the options
 installed with PRC*5.1*83, the users that should be added to the new mail
 group, and gives examples of the extract directory parameter setup and
 validation of that setup.
  
 **************************************************************************
 Only run these PRE and POST installation steps WHEN you are moving to a
 FULL LINUX SYSTEM otherwise move down to the ALL SITES INSTALLATION 
 INSTRUCTIONS.

 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP THE EXTRACT DIRECTORY FOR THE CLRS
 --------------------------------------------------------------
    
 Patch PRC*5.1*83 was created to extract and transmit PO Activity and 
 GIP module data from each station to a centrally located Report Server
 employed by the PCLO.
   
 In order for each station to communicate with the CLRS, it is
 important to establish an extract directory to transfer station-
 level data to the CLRS.
    
 The following steps MUST be performed by the System Manager, because
 Administrative privileges (for VMS, MS Windows or Linux OSs) are needed 
 in order to perform the tasks required.  
    
 Perform all steps relevant to your OS prior to installing this patch.
    
 1. Security Keys and Privileges
    ----------------------------
      You will need the following system access or privileges:
      Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming 
      System (MUMPS) Programmer
  
      Virtual Memory System (VMS) or Microsoft (MS) Windows/New Technology
      (NT) Administrator.
   
 2.  Station Number Identification
     -----------------------------
 NOTE:  Perform this step for each instance of Cache running on
        your server(s) (single or multiple instances).
   
        You should be at the Programmer prompt:  >
   
        You will need to obtain the station number from your system.  
    
 NOTE:  When your system was configured, a unique number was assigned 
        to the configuration (single station sites and multi-division 
        facilities).
   
        In order to obtain the station number (used to name the 
        directory), type the following two commands at the programmer 
        prompt:
    
 >S Y=$$GET1^DIQ(4,$$KSP^XUPARAM("INST")_",",99) [Enter]
 >W Y [Enter]
 >500
    
 NOTE:  In this example, the site number returned is 500.
        The command you entered MUST return a site number (which is 
        set in the variable Y).
    
 3.  Extract Directory Setup
     -----------------------
 NOTE:  The naming convention for directories is different for each OS.
        Be sure to follow the instructions for your particular OS.
          
        a.  Cache / VMS Sites
   
 NOTE:  The proposed naming convention is a recommendation. A more 
        knowledgeable and experienced System Manager may choose to setup 
        the extract directory using existing drives and definitions. The
        directory name chosen must have the appropriate READ, WRITE, 
        EXECUTE, and DELETE privileges.
    
        1)  Set up a VMS Directory named USER$:[CLRSxxx] where xxx is 
            the station number. 
            In our example, the name of the directory would be:  
            USER$:[CLRS500] (station number obtained in step 2).
   
 NOTE:  This directory will store approximately 10MB of data each month,
        but will be purged of existing data when the next monthly 
        occurs.  
   
        2)  The new directory MUST have READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, and DELETE
            privileges for the currently installed Cache instance.  
            You must have administrator privileges when you perform this
            task in order to assure the directory is setup/created with 
            the necessary permissions.
    
 Following is an example for you to follow to set up the extract 
 directory.
    
 NOTE:  The owner of the directory should be CACHEMGR.
    
 $ CREATE/DIRECTORY DISK$:[CLRSnnn] /own=CACHEMGR
 /PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED,G:RWED,W:RWED)/LOG
    
 NOTE:  Where DISK$=the disk of your choice (e.g. USER$, PQ$, etc. - SYS$
        is not recommended) and xxx=the station number.
    
        3)  Following is an example of the SPOOL directory which is
            presently configured on your Cache / VMS system. Also, these
            commands may be performed in VMS to view the SPOOL directory. 
   
 NOTE:  Confirm that the extract directory has similar protections and
        permissions 
    
 $ dir user$:[000000]spool.dir/sec
    
 Directory USER$:[000000]
    
  SPOOL.DIR;1          [CACHEMGR]                       
  (RWED,RWED,RWED,RWED)
  (IDENTIFIER=*,OPTIONS=DEFAULT,ACCESS=READ+WRITE+EXECUTE+DELETE)
    
 NOTE:  After the extract directory set up is complete, provide the 
        directory name to the IRM IFCAP Application support person 
        responsible for the installation of this patch. The extract 
        directory name will be entered into the PRCPLO EXTRACT
        DIRECTORY system parameter during patch installation.
    
         b.  Cache / MS Windows or NT Sites
   
 NOTE:  The proposed naming convention is a recommendation. A more 
        knowledgeable and experienced System Manager may choose to 
        setup the extract directory using existing drives and 
        definitions. The directory name chosen must have the 
        appropriate READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, and DELETE privileges. 
   
         1)   Set up an MS Windows directory named D:\CLRSxxx where xxx 
              is the station number.
              In our example, the name of the directory would be:  
              D:\CLRS500 (station number obtained in step 2).
   
 NOTE:  This directory will store approximately 10MB of data each month. 
        But will be purged of existing data when the next monthly 
        extract occurs.
  
         2)  The new directory MUST have READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, and DELETE
             privileges for the currently installed MS Windows instance.
             You must have administrator privileges when you perform this
             task in order to assure the directory is setup/created with 
             the necessary permissions.

      c. Linux Sites
  
 For sites converting to Linux from either Windows/NT or VMS
  
 1)   Establish a directory that will have read/write/execute/delete 
      privileges and will be accessible by VistA's TaskManager as 
      this will run as a background job. 
  
 2)  A preferred naming convention is recommended utilizing your 3 letter 
     FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name or SCD (Site Code Designation)
     and NNN (where N is the station number). As an example,
     the standards committee agreed that the equivalent for Linux 
     will be   /srv/vista/scd/user/clrsnnn.
  
     The FQDN/SCD would have been needed when the full LINUX OS was
     set up.
  
     Sites can find this AllSites list for their code at the following 
     internet address (This will need to be copy and pasted into notepad
     with the word wrap format off so that this whole address is on one
     line. Then copy and paste that into your address bar in your browser):

 nd%20Magic%20Numbers&FolderCTID=&View=%7b826C8328%2d7FEE%2d48A5%2d8B1E%2d8
 C55DDDD55C1%7d
  
 3)  If your station number was 656 and your FQDN/SCD code was stc, the 
     directory path you would create would be:
  
     /srv/vista/stc/user/clrs656 
  
     where stc is the 3 character FQDN/SCD code and 656 is your station
     number.
  
 4)  Please confirm that the new directory MUST have READ, WRITE,
     EXECUTE, and DELETE privileges for the currently installed Linux 
     instance. You must have administrator privileges when you perform 
     this task in order to assure the directory is setup/created with
     the necessary permissions.

 * The directory set up in the example is /srv/vista/stc/user/clrs656  * 
 * You MUST append a forward slash ( / ) to the CLRS Extract Directory *
 * name when you enter the value via option PRCPLO CLO SYSTEM PARAM,   *
 * for example:  /srv/vista/stc/user/clrs656/                          *
