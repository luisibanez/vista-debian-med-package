Subject: FCP EDI/DELIVERY ORDERS NOT ON UNOBL RUNNING BALANCE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 2 issues:
  
 1. When Fund Control Points are set to Electronic Data Interchange Auto
    Send, delivery orders automatically get obligated which affect the 
    Running Balance Report
  
 2. When Fund Control Point flag 'FCP ALL/DELIVERY ORDER SWITCH' is set to
    (A)ll Orders or (D)elivery orders, orders automatically get obligated
    which affect the Running Balance Report.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000055355 Delivery Orders not on UNOBL Running Balance when not
                    passed through Fiscal
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Problem with the functionality that automatically obligates delivery
 orders when the FCP (Fund Control Point) is set to EDI (Electronic Data 
 Interchange) Auto Send. This shows up having incorrect Fiscal balances on
 the Running Balance report.
  
 When users run the Running Balance Report the Fiscal UNOBL Running
 Balance (RB) was not affected by transactions that were not passed
 through Fiscal. These transactions were Auto sent to fiscal via
 EDI. The problem is not with the report, but with the processing of
 the transactions that are to be EDI Auto sent.
  
 Also, analysis found that an EDI oriented Delivery Order when cancelled 
 via an amendment DID NOT credit the obligated dollars on the Running 
 Balance report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the processing of delivery orders whose Fund Control Point is set 
 to EDI Auto Send 'Yes'.  If the FCP is set to EDI Auto Send and the user 
 has authorization to Sign orders, when they enter their Electronic 
 Signature the order will now automatically be obligated. The obligating 
 of the order will cause the Fiscal UNOBL RB to be affected on the Running 
 Balance report.
  
 Also, these same orders when cancelled through amendment processing 
 will now credit the FCP properly.

 2. HD0000000586999  Balances not matching
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Problem with the functionality that automatically obligates orders when 
 the FCP (Fund Control Point) or FCP site parameter 'FCP ALL/DELIVERY 
 ORDER SWITCH' is set to "A" or "D". This shows up as having incorrect 
 Fiscal balances on the Running Balance report.
  
 When users run the Running Balance Report the Fiscal UNOBL Running
 Balance (RB) was not affected by transactions that were not passed
 through Fiscal. These transactions were Auto sent to fiscal via logic 
 that drives auto obligation when parameter is set. The problem is not with
 the report, but with the processing of the orders that are to be auto 
 obligated based on the parameter setting.
  
 Also, analysis found that that these same orders when cancelled via an
 amendment DID NOT credit the obligated dollars on the Running 
 Balance report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Changed the processing of orders whose Fund Control Point is set to
 'FCP ALL/DELIVERY ORDER SWITCH'.  If the FCP or FCP site has the 
 switch set to "A" or "D" and the user has authorization to Sign orders, 
 when they enter their Electronic Signature the order will now 
 automatically be obligated. The obligating of the order will cause the
 Fiscal UNOBL RB to be affected on the Running Balance report.
  
 Also, these same orders when cancelled through amendment processing 
 will now credit the FCP properly.
