 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000335262 Ability to review 1358 during Obligation process
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When obligating a 1358 using option Obligate 1358 [PRCEF OBLIGATE]
    users have no way to verify the content  or to review 1358 for 
    full compliance prior to approving.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify routine PRCESOE to invoke a query asking user if they wish to 
    view the 1358 details:
       Would you like to review this request?? No// Y  (Yes)  
  
    Responding (Y)es will display the 1358 details.
  
    If the 1358 is viewed, the user will then be asked to continue with
    the 1358 Obligation:
       Would you like continue obligating this 1358?? Yes// N  (No)
  
    ** The VDL documentation will be updated for section 4.3 (Obligate the 
       1358) of the Accounting Technician User's Guide.

 2. HD0000000532391 Option PRCF PRINT FROM LIST causing disk free space 
                    warning
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The option Print/Reprint 1358s from list [PRCF PRINT FROM LIST] is 
    causing a disk free space warning due to infinite print loop caused by
    excessive Justification Text on 1358.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify line spacing logic to prevent lengthy Justification Text 
    from causing infinite print loop.
