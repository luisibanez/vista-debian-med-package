 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000341117  $ZE= <UNDEFINED>PERROR+3^PRCOSRV3 *PRCOXMRG
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Financial records are transmitted to VistA from FMS (Austin).  When a "bad"
 record is detected, IFCAP attempts to send an error report to the FMS mail
 group.  For Vendor Update (VUP) records the reporting code has a bug and
 fails with the <UNDEFINED>PERROR+3^PRCOSRV3 error. This was caused by trying
 to use an error report that was written for a different type of record.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A new error report was created specifically for the VUP records.
  
 Routines: PRCOVUP
  
  
 2. HD0000000126460  Control Point Users being able to Adjust PC orders?
  
 Problem:
 -------
 A site reports that any Control Point User can make adjustments to any
 Purchase Card Order even when they are not one of the authorized persons
 for that Purchase Card.  This is happening in the menu option 
 'Adjustment Voucher To Purchase Card Order'.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ----------                    
 When a Purchase Card Order is selected in the Adjustment Voucher To
 Purchase Card Order [PRCH ADUST VOUCH TO P/C ORDER] menu option, the
 user's identity is checked to see if they are either the CARD HOLDER,
 SURROGATE, APPROVING OFFICIAL, or ALTERNATE APPROVING OFFICIAL.  If they
 are not in that list then a warning message is displayed and they are not
 allowed to enter an adjustment for that order.

 3. HD0000000249121 FPDS question reflecting wrong dollar amount for 
                    contract
  
 Problem:
 -------
 When entering a new order a site found that the FPDS query portion of
 the order would ask for responses linked to contract/dollar amount not
 associate with the entered order. Analysis showed that processing in other
 options would at times leave contracts/dollar amounts from other orders in
 the array PRCH("AM").
  
 Resolution:
 ----------                    
 Modify routine PRCHE to insure the FPDS contract array is cleared when
 entering a new order to ascertain that contracts/dollar amounts associated
 with other orders are not brought into the new order creation.
