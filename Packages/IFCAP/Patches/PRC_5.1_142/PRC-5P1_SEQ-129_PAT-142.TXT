Subject: GIP TRANSACTION REGISTER REPORT;GIP ISSUE;PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Sites can only run the Transaction Register Report option [PRCP
    TRANSACTION REG REPORT] one month at a time.  Users need to be able to
    enter a From and To month period of time to report multiple months in a
    single run.
  
 2. Users are experiencing an issue with the GIP (Generic Inventory
    Package). When making a manual adjustment for an item with zero on
    hand, if only updating on hand quantity the inventory value remains at
    0. This causes negative inventory values with subsequent distributions.
    Will modify the QT (Quantities) action code of the ENter/Edit 
    Inventory Item Data option [PRCP EDIT INVENTORY ITEMS].
  
 3. Fiscal users that ran the Accrual (Monthly) option [PRCB MONTHLY
    ACCRUAL] reported a document transmission less than the compiled report
    dollars. File LOCK protection will be installed to ensure the compile
    completes before any other steps can be executed.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000288161 GIP Transaction Register Report print limitation
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Site can only run one month at a time when running the Transaction 
 Register Report option [PRCP TRANSACTION REG REPORT].
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify reporting process to allow user to enter a From/To month period of
 time to report multiple months in a single run. 
  
  
 Routines: PRCPRTRA, PRCPRTR1
  
  
 2. HD0000000286684 GIP Issue
  
 Problem:
 --------
 User is experiencing an issue with the GIP. When making a manual 
 adjustment for an item with zero on hand, if only updating on hand
 quantity the inventory value remains at 0 (along with the average cost).
 This causes negative inventory value with subsequent distributions.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify QT action code of the ENter/Edit Inventory Item Data option [PRCP
 EDIT INVENTORY ITEMS] to require entry of an inventory value when
 increasing on hand from zero to new amount. If the user is updating a zero
 value inventory item they will be asked to verify that they are updating
 only on-hand quantity on a zero value inventory item.

 3. HD0000000264196 PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL
  
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Fiscal users that run the Accrual (Monthly) option [PRCB MONTHLY ACCRUAL]
 reported a document transmission less than the compiled report dollars.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Analysis determined that users ran the Accrual (Monthly) option [PRCB 
 MONTHLY ACCRUAL] for step '1 Compile/Print Monthly Accrual' by tasking to
 a printer and IMMEDIATELY ran step '3 Generate/Rebuild FMS SV-Document'
 before the compile had completed in the tasked option.  Installed file
 LOCK protection to ensure compile has completed before any other steps can
 be executed.

 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 The revised documentation is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory
 at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field Offices. These
 files should be retrieved in binary format.
     
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from  the first
  available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a  
  specific server as follows:
  
      Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
  The documentation distribution includes:
  
  File Name                 Description                     Protocol
  ---------                 -----------                     --------
  ifcp5_1pou_maunual.pdf    Point of Use Manual             Binary
  ifcp5_1gip.pdf            Generic Inventory User Manual   Binary
