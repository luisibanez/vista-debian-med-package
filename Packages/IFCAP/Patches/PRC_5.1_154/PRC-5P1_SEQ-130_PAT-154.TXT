Subject: CERTIFIER ROLE FOR 1358S PROCESSED IN IFCAP INVOICE TRACKING MODULE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)
  - Data Dictionary
  - Print Template

Description:
============

 The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and US Congress have expressed
 concern about the lack of enforced segregation of duties in the use of the
 1358 Miscellaneous Obligation.  This patch introduces changes to IFCAP's
 Payment/Invoice Tracking module to prevent someone who was a requestor,
 approver, or obligator of a 1358 from certifying in IFCAP an invoice
 against that 1358.  It also introduces a new segregation of duties report
 based on certifications in the INVOICE TRACKING file (#421.5), which will
 identify violations if they have occurred.  Additionally, it enhances the
 CLRS(Clinical Logistics Report Server, also known as National Logistics
 Database) extract to include data from the INVOICE TRACKING file so that
 upper management can centrally monitor the use of the Payment/Invoice
 Tracking module and check for segregation of duties violations.

 20080801 Enhancing Internal Controls and Reporting Capabilities for 1358 
          Misc Obligations: Implements adequate controls with respect to 
          segregation of duties and oversight by contracting officials,
          improving documentation requirements, and enhancing 1358
          reporting capabilities within Integrated Funds Distribution,
          Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement (IFCAP) that
          will be used at the station, Veterans Integrated Service Network
          (VISN), and enterprise levels.  A Government Accountability
          Office (GAO) review questioned VHA's internal control standards
          governing the authorization and use of miscellaneous obligations
          as well as oversight abilities. Direction by the Congressional
          Oversight Committee of the House.  GAO Report - GAO-08-1056T

          Obligations, July 31, 2008.  Department of Veterans Affairs

          Processing of Miscellaneous Obligations, VA Form 4-1358, dated

 The changes made by this patch are described below:
 1. Added check in options New Invoice [PRCFD ADD NEW INVOICE], Log-in 
    Certified Invoices from Services [PRCFD CHECKIN INVOICE], and Approve 
    Payment of Invoices Already Checked in [PRCFD APPROVE PAYMENT], to
    prevent user who was a requestor, approver, or obligator on a 1358 from
    certifying for payment an invoice against that 1358.
  
 2. Added to Compliance Reports (1358) menu the option Invoice
    Certification Seg Duties Violation Rpt [PRCFD INVOICE CERT SOD RPT]
    which shows for invoices certified for payment in IFCAP's
    Payment/Invoice Tracking module the names of the requestor, approver,
    obligator, and certifier and identifies any violations in segregation
    of duties.
  
 3. Enhanced the CLRS (Clinical Logistics Report Server) extract to
    include data from the INVOICE TRACKING file (#421.5) header and
    subfiles.
  
 4. Added to menu CLRS Extract Validation Templates [PRCHLO CLRS
    VALIDATION] the inquire options IH Invoice Tracking Header - F24
    [PRCHLO INVOICE TRKG HEADER, IP Invoice Tracking Prompt Pmt Terms - F25
    [PRCHLO INVOICE TRKG PROMPT PMT], IF Invoice Tracking FMS Lines - F26
    [PRCHLO INVOICE TRKG FMS LINES], and IC Invoice Tracking Certifying Svc
    - F27 [PRCHLO INVOICE TRKG CERTIFYING] so that users can compare data
    shown from the database to corresponding data that was extracted into
    host files for the CLRS database.
  
 5. Changed the logic for extracting the Sort Group value from file #410
    to prevent abend in the rare instance that an entry's value is corrupt.
  
 6. Changed the logic in print template PRCHLO410_HDR_VALIDATE for fields
    OBLIGATION VAL CODE DATE/TIME (#29.8) and ES CODE DATE/TIME (#44.6) to
    display time, as well as, date.
  
 7. Added cleanup of %DT variable in the SERVICE END DATE (#6.5) field of 
    the CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) file.  This variable was leaving
    around the %DT(0) causing some date prompting issues in other date
    prompts.

    Before:       n/a   After:   B406680  **154**
 Description of Changes:
  This is the post-init routine for PRC*5.1*154. It contains code to 
  reindex the new "AF" cross reference on the CERTIFIED BY SIG DATE/TIME 
  field (#61.9) of the INVOICE TRACKING file (#421.5).
   
  This routine is automatically deleted from the namespace (UCI) at the 
  conclusion of the KIDS installation process.

Routine Name: PRCFDCI1
    Before:  B5189866   After:  B5368338  **154**
 Description of Changes:

Routine Name: PRCFDE1
    Before: B17952536   After: B18830215  **154**
 Description of Changes:

  New Invoice.

Routine Name: PRCFDE3
    Before: B17247666   After: B17499299  **154**

    Before:       n/a   After:  B9304570  **154**
 Description of Changes:
  New extrinsic function $$VIOLATE^PRCFDSOD()checks if the invoice is 
  against a 1358 obligation and if so invokes function UOKCERT^PRCEMOA() to 
  determine if the current person has previously signed as a requestor, 
  approver, or obligator for that 1358 and thus is prohibited from 
  certifying the invoice for payment. It returns '0' if the person is 
  permitted to certify and '1' if the person is prohibited from certifying.
