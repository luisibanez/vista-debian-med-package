Description:
============

 Patch Overview
 ==================================================
  
 This patch will establish bi-directional communication between Integrated 
 Funds Distribution, Control Point Activity, Accounting and Procurement 
 (IFCAP) and the commercial Electronic Contracting Management System (eCMS)
 located at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) in Austin 
 Texas.
  
 This enhancement will capitalize on the abilities of eCMS to consolidate
 multiple requests, electronically prepare and issue solicitation
 documents, receive electronic offers, automate contract administration,
 and provide interfaces to the Integrated Acquisition Environment
 initiatives.
  
 The eCMS is capable of aggregating solicitations from multiple sites and
 funding sources and can create a single solicitation that will be posted
 on the eCMS Vendor Portal, a secure web-based system that allows vendors
 to view solicitations and submit price quotes.  Thus, the price quote
 from the vendor will be based on greater quantities.  The contracting
 officer will log on to eCMS to view the price quotes and determine the
 winning bid.  Users will then log on to their local IFCAP application and
 create the Purchase Order and obligate the funds just as they do now.
  
 Implementation of this patch will allow 2237 data to be transmitted
 between the IFCAP application and eCMS using Health Level 7 (HL7) 
 messaging.
  
 The Accountable Officer in IFCAP will be able to:
  
  * Use the existing IFCAP option: Process a Request in PPM [PRCHPM REQST]
    to transmit a 2237 directly from IFCAP to eCMS.
  * Use new option: Retransmit a 2237 to eCMS [PRCHJ RETRANS 2237] to
    resend 2237, if needed.
  
 The eCMS User will be able to:
  
  * Return 2237 to Accountable Officer for review and processing within
    IFCAP. 
  * Return 2237 to Control Point User for edit and resubmission to eCMS.
  * Cancel a 2237 in IFCAP directly from eCMS.

        messages through VIE.
  
           *********** IMPORTANT NOTE ************
  Any time you re-install this patch, logical link entry PRCHJ_ECMS will
  get overwritten and need to be re-configured. 
  
  2. After you have edited the above fields, it is also advisable to test
     the functionality of the PRCHJ_ECMS link in option HLO SYSTEM MONITOR
     [HLO SYSTEM MONITOR] using Action TL TEST TCP LINK. A successful test
     should return the result "PRCHJ_ECMS:8090 IS operational...".  To use
     this option you need to have been assigned two security keys: HLOMGR
     and HLOMAIN.
  
  3. This interface uses the standard HLO listener for your VistA instance.
     It should already be operational.  You can determine the name of that
     listener by either stepping through option EDIT HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS
     [HLO EDIT SYSTEM PARAMETERS] to see the name listed by the HLO
     STANDARD LISTENER prompt, or by doing a VA FileMan inquiry on the
     single entry in the HLO SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#779.1) for the value
     of the HLO STANDARD LISTENER field (#.1).  One can also test the
     functionality of that link using the TL TEST TCP LINK Action in
     option HLO SYSTEM MONITOR.
