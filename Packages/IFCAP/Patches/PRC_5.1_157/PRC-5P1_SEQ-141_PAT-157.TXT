 This is a temporary holding file used to store a purchase order while an 
 Amendment is being created.  Changes to a P.O. are actually made to this 
 file, and not to the original P.O.  If the user completes and approves
 the Amendment, the changes are copied to the P.O.  Whether approved or 
 not, the "copy" is deleted from this file when the user is finished. The
 file is also used for amendments to Requisitions.
