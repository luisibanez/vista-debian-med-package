 This patch will address the following 3 issues:
  
 1. Requisition deletions causing filing errors.
  
 2. Temporary requests being changed to a new transaction number do not 
    clear the temporary request cross reference pointers.
  
 3. Changing the description on a Fund Control Point will cause previous
    temporary transactions to fall off the Temporary Transaction Listing.

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. HD0000000617074 <UNDEFINED>CPBAL+19^PRCBIE2*DA
                                   
    Problem:
    --------
    Sites found that during normal processing for requisitions, 1358s or 
    ceiling transactions that they would be locked out for a long time or 
    getting errors due to null IEN being returned from CONTROL POINT 
    ACTIVITY (#410) file. Also, site saw the File 410, node 0 counter
    jumping around rather than to the next descending value.
  
    Also, sites were allowed to enter the same name for a temporary 
    transaction between different users affecting the adverse assignment of
    internal entry numbers (IEN).
  
    Lastly, when running option Cancel Transaction with Permanent Number
    [PRCSCT] on a temporary transaction the entry is only cancelled leaving
    the number non reusable.
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                                    
    Modified all File 410 delete processing (using Fileman call to ^DIK) to
    ascertain the current counter was retained after the delete of any File
    410 entry.
  
    Also, modified the LAYGO lookup to prevent the duplicate use of any 
    previously used temporary requisition/1358 name across all users.
  
    Lastly, when running option 'Cancel Transaction with Permanent Number'
    a temporary transaction will be deleted when cancelled.

 2. HD0000000434202 Xrefs not cleaning up in File 410 re Temp Transactions
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Users can enter temporary requests into IFCAP system which will then be
    converted to valid requisition (option Change Existing Transaction 
    Number) after review by appropriate IFCAP staff.  The process of
    changing the temporary request number to a valid requisition number is
    not deleting all the associated pointers to the old temporary number in
    CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) file.
  
    Also, a user could create a temporary transaction number that would be 
    allowed to be used by other users, but not the original creator. A
    second matching transaction number caused the internal entry number
    assignment for the temporary transaction to go awry.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modifications have been made to the process 'Change Existing
    Transaction Number' that will delete all associated cross references to
    the original temporary request number.
  
    A modification was made to prevent any Temporary Request user from
    using the same temporary request transaction number previously used in
    system.
  
    Also, a post install routine (PRCS150P) will run to remove any
    temporary transactions in 'B' cross reference that do not have a
    matching entry in CONTROL POINT ACTIVITY (#410) file. The purged
    invalid cross references will be kept in temporary work file for 120
    days as:
  
    ^XTMP("PRCS150P","B",temp req#,410 ien)
  
    and any temporary transactions created before 10/01/2010 and cancelled 
    temporary requisitions will be deleted from file 410 and stored in the
    same temporary work file for 120 days as:
  
    ^XTMP("PRCS150P","DT",temp req#,410 ien)
  
 Routines: PRCSUT2, PRCSEA, PRCSEA1, PRCSES, PRCS150P (post install)
  
  
 3. HD0000000449216 Temporary Transaction Number Control Point Rename
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Changing the description of a Fund Control Point (FCP) on a temporary
    transaction will prevent the temporary transaction from appearing on
    the Temporary Transaction Listing.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modify print process for Temporary Transaction Listing to look at cross
    reference for FCP number in lieu of FCP description.
