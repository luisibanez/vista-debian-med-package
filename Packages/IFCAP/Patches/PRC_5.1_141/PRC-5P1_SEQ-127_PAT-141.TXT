Subject: PROSTHETICS GUI REQUIRED BY DATE FIELD DOES NOT TRANSFER TO PURCHASE CARD ORDER

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 Prosthetics GUI Required By date field does not transfer to Purchase Card
 order.
  
 ***This is a combined patch with patch RMPR*3*157.  Both patches will be 
 loaded into your system when the combined host file RMPR_3_P157.KID
 is loaded. The patches are combined due to the fact that the PRC 
 application retrieves data from the RMPR application. The change that is 
 being made in the RMPR patch will affect the PRC application.  It is 
 imperative that both patches are installed at the same time to prevent 
 an error. Combining these patches will ensure both patches are installed 
 together.***

 Remedy Overview:
 ================ 
 1) HD0000000369460 Prosthetics GUI Required date field does not transfer 
                    to Purchase Card Program
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Users have noticed that when creating an order via the Prosthetics GUI 
 suite, the order created in IFCAP (PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS 
 file #442) does not contain the Required By date. When viewing either
 Display Purchase Card or reprinting Purchase Card order the date does not 
 appear on print outs.  However, the date DOES appear when reprinting the
 Prosthetics purchase order.
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine RMPR121A in Prosthetics to send the Used By date (entered
 during GUI suite order creation) to IFCAP routine PRCH7PUC to set the
 date in the Delivery Date field (#7) in the PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING
 TRANSACTIONS file (#442).

     Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.
     The preferred method is to FTP the files from:
  
           download.vista.med.va.gov
  
     This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.
     Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific
     server as follows:
  
           Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
           Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
           Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
  
     The RMPR_3_P157.KID;1 host file is located in the anonymous.software
     directory.  Use ASCII Mode when downloading the file.
  
 2.  Load the KIDS distribution contained in file RMPR_3_P157.KID;1
     using the Load a Distribution option on the Installation menu.

     the Installation menu.
  
 4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options

        message of any routines exported with the patch. It will NOT
        backup any other changes such as DDs or templates.
  
     b. Compare Transport Global to Current System - this option will
        allow you to view all changes that will be made when the patch
        is installed. It compares all components of the patch (routines,
        DDs, templates, etc.).
  
     c. Verify Checksums in Transport Global - this option will ensure
        the integrity of the routines that are in the transport global.
