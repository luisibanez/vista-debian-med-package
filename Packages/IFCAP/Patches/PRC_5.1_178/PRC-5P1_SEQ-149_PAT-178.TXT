 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================ 
 1. INC000000818642 FMS Document Transmission Issue
  
  
    Problem:
    --------
    During order obligation a fiscal data document is transmitted to FMS 
    using a HL7 packet layout., The HL7 packet created uses segment MOA for
    Cost Center and Sub Cost Center.  When using a Cost Center with the
    last two digits other than 00, (ex. 802101) it is set as 802100 in the
    Cost Center field and the Sub Cost Center field is set with the last
    two digits of the Cost Center which in this case is 01.
  
    The problem has been for some time that FMS has been expecting the full
    cost center and sub cost center (802101) to be reported fully within
    the Cost Center field of the MOA segment and the Sub Cost Center field
    always set to 00.
    
    Example:
    Using the same Cost Center 802101
    ^GECS(2100.1,7026,10,5,0)="LIN^~MOA^001^^^^13^^0160A2^688^802100^01^01EB4
    41X9^3220^^^150.00^|^~"
  
  
  
    Resolution:
    -----------                    
    Modify the FMS transmission packet created for segment MOA for Cost 
    Center and Sub Cost Center.  Cost Center (ex. 802101) will now be set
    as 802101 in the Cost Center fields and the Sub Cost Center field will 
    be set with 00. This will align the Cost Center handling with the
    current process used by the FMS data handler.
  
    Example:
    ^GECS(2100.1,7026,10,5,0)="LIN^~MOA^001^^^^13^^0160A2^688^802101^00^01EB4
    41X9^3220^^^150.00^|^~"
