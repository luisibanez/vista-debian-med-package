  ************************************************************************
  
 The changes made by patch PRC*5.1*162 are described below:
  
 1.  ALLOW FEE BASIS TO SKIP FUND CONTROL POINT ACCESS CHECK
     -------------------------------------------------------
     The Fee Basis software calls IFCAP routine PRCS58CC to post a credit
     amount to a 1358 authorization when a fee payment line item is flagged
     as rejected.  This is permitted by Integration Control Registration
     (ICR) #831.
  
     IFCAP currently requires the user account to have access (as clerk or
     official) to the fund control point associated with the 1358
     obligation.
  
     This patch modifies IFCAP routine PRCS58CC and ICR #831 to support an
     additional input parameter. If this optional input parameter is set
     IFCAP will skip the fund control point access check.
  
     Fee Basis will set the new parameter for payment line items that are
     flagged as rejected by Central Fee (Austin) using a new interface 
     transaction.  These transactions are processed by a background job
     where the user account is POSTMASTER.
  
  
 2.  DELETE OBSOLETE OPTIONS
     -----------------------
     The 994 type code sheets will become obsolete when patch FB*3.5*132
     is implemented by a site.
  
     Patch PRC*5.1*162 will remove the Fee Basis - IFCAP Code Sheet Menu
     [PRC FEE GECS MAIN MENU] from the Accounting Technician Menu [PRCFA
     ACCTG TECH].
     
     The Fee Basis - IFCAP Code Sheet Menu and attached options (18 total)
     will be deleted by this patch.
