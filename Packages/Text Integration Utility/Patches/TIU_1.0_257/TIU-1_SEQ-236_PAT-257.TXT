Associated patches: (v)TIU*1*244   <<= must be installed BEFORE `TIU*1*257'

Subject: Mobile Electronic Documentation

Category: 
  - PATCH FOR A PATCH

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two potential patient safety issues with the Mobile
 Electronic Documentation application released with TIU*1.0*244.
 
 The first issue addressed is related to the intermittent failure when 
 retrieving patient data into the MED database when two or more users 
 simultaneously attempted to retrieve health summary information.  The data was
 either not imported or imported and associated within the MED database to the
 incorrect patient.
 
 The second issue addressed is related to a patient having an incomplete or
 corrupted date of birth.  MED would not allow patient information to be 
 retrieved and would not allow that patient to be imported into the MED 
 database.  This issue is fixed in the latest GUI client application.
 
 Client Application/Documentation:
 ================================
 The KIDS build and GUI Client are being distributed as a host file via FTP. 
 Complete documentation for the MED application is included in the required 
 patch TIU*1.0*244.  Installation instructions for the MED GUI client are found
 in the TIU*1*257 documentation.  
  
 
 DOCUMENTATION: 
 ============== 
 Documentation is available for the TIU Mobile Electronic Documentation
 on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE directory at one of the following Office of 
 Information (OI) Field Offices. Sites will be able to utilize
 Documentation in either the ".PDF" or "DOC" format after they extract 
 the ZIP file.
  
 The preferred method is to FTP the files from: Download.vista.med.va.gov
  
 This transmits files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve documentation directly from a specific server as 
 follows:
 
        Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
        Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
        Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov

 SOFTWARE INSTALLATAION:
 ======================
 The file listed below must be obtained from a password protected FTP server
 located in Silver Spring.  The implementation manager will be contacting 
 each site with the username and password needed to access the file.

 IMPORTANT:  This patch will be implemented in a phased approach and is 
 scheduled to be coordinated from FY2011 Q2 until FY2011 Q4.  Thereafter 
 it will be a standard, monitored release that will begin upon completion of
 the first phase.
 
 On your scheduled implementation date, your IRM POC will be contacted with 
 the username and password needed to obtain the software from the protected 
 server.  Site questions and problems should be reported via Remedy.
 
 When the phased implementation has ended, the preferred method will be to 
 FTP the files from download.vista.med.va.gov.
 This transmits the files from the first available FTP server. Sites may also 
 elect to retrieve software directly from a specific server as follows:
  
   Albany         ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov  <ftp://ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov>
   Hines          ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov   <ftp://ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov>
