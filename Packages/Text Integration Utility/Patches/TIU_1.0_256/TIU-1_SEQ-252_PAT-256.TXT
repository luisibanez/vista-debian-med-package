Description:
============

 This patch will address the following issue:
  
 When a Nurse Intraoperative report (NIR) or Anesthesia report (AR) is
 entered and signed in the Surgery package, a note is created in Text

 They will be able to do so through CPRS GUI via the Surgery tab or in Vista
 through the following options:

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1) HD0000000389575 - Delete Case
  
   Problem 1:
   ----------
   When a Nurse Intraoperative report or Anesthesia report is entered and
   signed in the Surgery package, a note is created in the TIU DOCUMENT
   (#8925) file.  If the need arises, there is no way to delete/retract
   the note in Surgery or TIU.
  
   Resolution 1:
   -------------
   Allow ASU user classes:
    - CHIEF, HIMS
    - CHIEF, MIS
    - PRIVACY ACT OFFICER
   the ability to delete/retract NIRs or ARs regardless of business rules.
   They will be able to do so through CPRS GUI via the Surgery tab or in Vista
   through the following options:
  
    - Individual Patient Document       [TIU BROWSE DOCUMENT MGR]
    - Search for Selected Documents     [TIU SEARCH LIST MGR]
    - Multiple Patient Documents        [TIU REVIEW SCREEN MIS MANAGER]
  
  
   NOTE:
   -----                                        
   When an NIR or AR is deleted/retracted, a new stub is created for the 
   report with a status of "undictated".  This new stub still points to 
   the Surgery case. A Surgery support person then manually deletes the
   undictated TIU stub.  They then delete the Surgery pointer to the TIU
   stub so that the Surgery case can be deleted.

 If sites have business rules for action DELETE Nurse Intraoperative report

 business rules will have no relevance after this patch is installed because

 classes: HIMS/MIS Chiefs and Privacy Act Officers.
