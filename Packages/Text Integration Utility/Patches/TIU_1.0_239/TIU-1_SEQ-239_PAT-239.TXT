Subject: USER CLASS AND CONSULTS API FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch corrects four site reported issues within the Text Integration
 Utilities (TIU) package:
  
      1) A provider enters a consult and associates a consult note to
         it, and then decides to change the title to a non-consult title.
         The consult note does not disassociate from the consult, instead
         it leaves the consult in partial result (pr) status.
     
      2) A provider enters a consult and associates it with a consult note,
         then later realizes the note was associated to the wrong consult. 
         The note can be edited and changed to associate with the correct
         consult, but the status of the first consult does not revert to 
         the active (a) status, but stays in the partial result (pr)
         status.
  
      3) On the day a user has a particular user class expire that 
         requires a cosigner, if they create a note they are not prompted
         for an expected cosigner. When they go to sign the note, however, 
         they get the message that a cosigner must be named before the note
         can be signed.
  
      4) When a user that requires a cosigner attempts to identify 
         additional signers to a completed document entered by another 
         user, the user receives the message box that displays "You must
         name a cosigner before signing this document". The message box 
         that should display is "You may not IDENTIFY SIGNERS FOR this 
         COMPLETED <title of note>."

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 =================
 1) HD0000000168903 - TIU documents/consults
  
 Problem:
 --------
 If a provider enters a consult and associates a Consult note to it, saves
 the note without signing it, then decides to changes the title to a
 non-consult title, the note does not disassociate from the consult.
 Instead it leaves the consult in Partial Result (pr) status.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 A consult's status will be rolled back to Active (a) when a Consult 
 note's title is changed to a non-consult title. 
  
 Routines: TIUSRVP
  
  
 2) HD0000000311014 - One Progress Note on two consults
  
 Problem:
 --------
 A user enters a consult note and associates it with Consult A.  They 
 then save the note without a signature. Later, they realize the note is
 associated with the wrong consult and they Edit the note, select the 
 Change button but DO NOT change the title.  They simply associate it 
 with the correct consult, Consult B. Under the Consults tab, both 
 consults are associated with the same note, while Consult B has a status 
 of Complete (c) while Consult A still shows the status of Partial Result
 (pr).
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Upon changing a Consult note's association, the consult the note was 
 originally associated to will be correctly rolled back to a status of 
 Active (a).
  
 Routines: TIUSRVP
  
  
 3) HD0000000152076 - Expected cosigner not being prompted with addendum
  
 Problem:
 --------
 On the day a user has a particular user class expire that requires a 
 co-signer, if they create a note, they are not prompted for an expected 
 cosigner. When they go to sign the note, however, they get the following
 message: "You must name a cosigner before signing this document.".
  
 Resolution:
 ----------- 
 The code that determines cosigner requirements upon note creation will 
 now be in sync with that which determines it upon note signature. 
  
 Routines: TIUSRVA
  
  
 4) HD0000000131840 - Addtl Signer - User Class Requiring Cosignature
  
 Problem:
 --------
 When a user who requires cosigner attempts to add an additional signer 
 to a note entered by another author, instead of receiving the message box
 that states "You may not IDENTIFY SIGNERS FOR this COMPLETED <title of 
 note>", they receive the message box that states "You must name a
 cosigner before signing this document."  The latter message is misleading
 to the user and not consistent with the former message.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 The correct message will now appear in the above situation.
