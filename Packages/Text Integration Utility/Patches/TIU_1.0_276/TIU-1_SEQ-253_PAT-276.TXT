 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 ======================
 1. INC000000070219 - PAL-0803-60554  Expected cosigner
  
   Problem:
   -------
   When running a search using the Show Progress Notes Across Patients 
   option [TIU REVIEW PN CLINICIAN], if searching by Expected Cosigner,
   only users who are currently authorized to cosign documents can be
   searched for.  This makes it impossible to search for documents whose
   Expected Cosigner is no longer an active provider.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   Changed the search so it is possible to search by Expected Cosigner 
   even if the user is not a current provider.
  
  
 2. INC000000070634 - HIN-0304-42622  DOCUMENT LINKED TO REMINDER DIALOG & 
                      TIU BOILERPLATE
  
   Problem:
   -------
   If a TIU document with boilerplate text is linked to a template in 
   CPRS, then when a new note is created, the boilerplate text is loaded
   directly into the text of the note rather than appearing in an order
   dialog. This can result in field links or display-only text being added.
  
   Resolution:
   ----------
   At the request of the CPRS Workgroup, TIU documents with linked 
   templates will no longer load any boilerplate text associated with the
   document itself in the CPRS GUI.
