Subject: MED GUI V2 MAINTENANCE

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

  This patch will correct the following issues:
  1) If a user enters a note in Mobile Electronic Documentation (MED), and
     does not select a different note before exiting, in some cases the
     newly entered note would be lost.
  
  2) The parameter [TIU MED HSTYPE] Health Summary Type for MED was set to
     accept a free text value that should contain a pointer to the Health
     Summary type to be used with MED. This was a problem, because a user
     had to know the Internal Entry Number (IEN) of the health summary in
     order to update the parameter.
  
  3) When certain Patient Data Objects (PDO) are imported from MED notes,
     internal data was incorrectly getting added to the note.
  
  4) MED was calculating when to suggest database compaction incorrectly.
     Also, when database compaction was suggested, and the users clicked
     Yes in order to compact the database, MED would get stuck in an
     infinite loop and hang.
  
  5) The Action menu, in MED is displaying on all tabs, even though it is 
     only related to the Notes tab. This can cause confusion if there is a 
     note selected on the notes tab and the user is on a different tab.
  
  6) When using a dialog template in MED, parent choices are grayed out,
     but the same choices are not grayed out if viewed in CPRS.
  
  7) Med Install guide references the wrong Security Key.
  
  8) If a user attempted to retrieve two patients with the same names they
     would import correctly, but only one would be selectable in the
     patient selection dialog.

 Overview of Remedy ticket(s):
 =============================
  1) HD0000000465060 - Mobile Med - Memphis Saving last note issue
  Problem 1:
  ----------
  If a user enters a note in MED, and does not select a different note
  before exiting, in some cases the newly entered note would be lost.
  
  Resolution 1:
  -------------
  The MED GUI has been updated to list the Save option in the Actions 
  menu, so that users can save notes at any point while entering. It 
  should also be noted that each note will be saved locally every few 
  seconds, to ensure as much data is retained as possible even through 
  system failure.
  
  
  2) HD0000000476493 - XPAR Menu Tools doesn't work to set HS Type
  Problem 2:
  ----------
  The parameter [TIU MED HSTYPE] Health Summary Type for MED was set to
  accept a free text value that should contain a pointer to the Health
  Summary type to be used with MED. This was a problem, because a user had
  to know the Internal Entry Number of the health summary in order to
  update the parameter.
  
  Resolution 2:
  -------------
  The [TIU MED HSTYPE] Health Summary Type for MED parameter definition and
  routine TIUMED1 have been modified so that the parameter will now list
  Health Summary types for selection, as well as all name entry.
  
  
  3) HD0000000496166 - TIU (MED) Support/Active Problems PDO does not 
                       import
  Problem 3:
  ----------
  When certain Patient Data Objects are imported from MED notes, internal 
  data was incorrectly getting added to the note. 
  
  Resolution 3:
  -------------
  The MED Imported DLL has been updated to exclude the extra internal 
  information from notes that contain PDO when imported by MED.
  
  
  4) HD0000000509956 - Suggested Database Compaction Causes Crash. 
  Problem 4:
  ----------
  MED was calculating when to suggest database compaction incorrectly.
  Also, when database compaction was suggested, and the users clicked Yes
  in order to compact the database, MED would get stuck in an infinite loop
  and hang.
  
  Resolution 4:
  -------------
  The MED GUI has been modified to correctly calculate the size of the 
  database, and correctly close after database compaction.
  
  
  5) HD0000000491440 - Deactivate Edit/Delete Action Menu on ScratchPad
  Problem 5:
  ----------
  The Action menu in MED is displaying on all tabs, even though it is 
  only related to the Notes tab. This can cause confusion if there is a 
  note selected on the notes tab and the user is on a different tab.
  
  Resolution 5:
  -------------
  The MED GUI has been modified to only display the Action menu when the 
  Notes tab is the current selection.
  
  
  6) HD0000000536495 - Wording of templates
  Problem 6:
  ----------
  When using a dialog template in MED, parent choices are grayed out, but
  the same choices are not grayed out if viewed in CPRS.
  
  Resolution 6:
  -------------
  The MED GUI has been modified so that the parent dialog templates are 
  correctly displayed in black and are no longer grayed out.
  
  
  7) HD0000000555934 - Update to TIU Manuals
  Problem 7:
  ----------
  MED Release Notes & Installation Guide references the wrong Security Key.
  
  Resolution 7:
  -------------
  Modified the reference to the XUPROG Security key on page 12 of the
  install guide to correctly reference the TIU MED MGT key.
  
  
  8) HD0000000580076 - Unable to differentiate between similar names
  Problem 8:
  ----------
  If a user attempted to retrieve two patients with the same names they
  would import correctly, but only one would be selectable in the patient
  selection dialog.
  
  Resolution 8:
  -------------
  Allow the use of duplicate entries in the patient selection dialog
  so patients with the same name are now individually selectable.

 INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
 =====================
 There is a Vista Patch Installation and a TIU MED GUI Client Installation.
 The Vista Patch and the GUI Client have NO dependencies on each other, so 
 the order of installation is not important. Either can be installed 
 separately without any adverse affects.
 The Vista Patch can be installed before the GUI Client is updated on your 
 TIU MED Workstations, however, the workstations should be updated as soon 
 as possible (see TIU_1_264_MED_IG).
  
 The Vista Patch will take less than 1 minute.
 Suggested time to install: non-peak requirement hours.
 Users do NOT have to be off the system during install.
  
   1. Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
  
   2. From the Kernel Installation & Distribution System menu, select
      the Installation menu.

              the components of the KIDS build.
