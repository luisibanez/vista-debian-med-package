Subject: FIXES FOR ADDITIONAL SIGNER AND LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT ISSUES

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Data Dictionary
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addresses the following issues:
  
 1) On CPRS/Notes tab and certain List Manager options if a document is 
 Administratively Closed the Additional Signer information does not 
 display.
  
 2) For TIU PARAMETER "START OF ADD SGNR ALERT" the ??doc or TIU Technical
 Manual does not give a clear explanation of how to set the field since 
 parameter LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD was added.
  
 3) There is no documentation in the TIU Technical Manual on how to set 
 LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD. In the TIU Technical Manual there is no
 documentation on the TIU Nightly Task.
  
 4) Additional signers are unable to sign Administratively Closed notes
 due to blank character strings (***).

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 1) HD0000000229090 - 2 ADDITIONAL SIGNERS on an iMedConsent-generated 
  
 Problem 1:
 ----------
 On the CPRS Notes Tab, Additional Signer information does not show for 
 documents that are Administratively Closed in the regular display.  It 
 does show in the detailed display.  This is for both Awaiting Signature
 and Electronic Signature.
  
 In List Manager, the same problem with Additional Signature for 
 Administratively Closed documents occurs for the following options:
  
  Progress Notes User Menu
         Review Progress Notes by Patient
         Review Progress Notes/Browse
  TIU MAIN MENU MGR
         Individual Patient Document
  TIU MAIN MENU MRT
         Individual Patient Document
  TIU MAIN MENU TRANSCRIPTION
         Individual Patient Document
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 For CPRS, modify routine TIUSRVR3 to display the Additional Signature on 
 Administratively closed documents. For LM, modify routine TIUBR1 to 
 display the Additional Signature on Administratively closed documents.
  
 2) HD0000000247418 - 2 view alerts disappearing
  
 Problem:
 --------
 Since the addition of the parameter LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD to the 
 TIU PARAMETER FILE (8925.99), there has been some confusion over the
 effect that parameter has on parameter START OF ADD SGNR ALERT
 PERIOD.  The patch that added LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD detailed that 
 START OF ADD SGNR ALERT should be set to the same value. The '??doc' or 
 the TIU Technical Manual does not detail this setting.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Update the '??doc' for START OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD to read as follows:
  
    START OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD: 
         This is the start date for evaluating documents that have overdue
         additional signatures. The value must be in a FileMan date range 
         format such as 6D, 3W or 4M. If this field is left blank, all
         documents evaluated that have a date less than the END OF ADD SGNR
         ALERT PERIOD date will be included.
          
         Since the addition of the LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD parameter 
         this field should be set to the same value as that field. If
         LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD is left blank then set this field to
         12M, the default value of the LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD when
         no value is entered.  LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD determines how
         far back in time documents are evaluated.
  
 Update the TIU Technical Manual with the same information.  
  
 Also, add missing documentation in the TIU Technical Manual for LENGTH OF 
 SIGNER ALERT PERIOD to read as follows:
  
    LENGTH OF SIGNER ALERT PERIOD: 
         This is the length of time that the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will go back 
         prior to "today" when searching for documents that have overdue
         signatures. The value must be in a FileMan date range format such
         as 6D, 3W or 4M.
          
         If no value is entered, the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will begin searching 
         for documents starting at 1 year prior to "today" in the TIU
         DOCUMENTS file (8925).
  
 In addition, modify the TIU Technical Manual for END OF ADD SGNR ALERT 
 PERIOD to read as follows:
  
    END OF ADD SGNR ALERT PERIOD: 
         This is the length in time from the current date that the TIU 
         NIGHTLY TASK will stop regenerating alerts for overdue additional
         signatures. The value must be in a FileMan date range format such
         as 6D, 3W or 4M.
          
         If no value is entered, the TIU NIGHTLY TASK will search for 
         documents in the TIU DOCUMENT File (8925) up to the current date.
    
  
 3) HD0000000070039 - There are no instructions in the TIU Technical 
 Manual for the TIU NIGHTLY TASK.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 There are no instructions in the TIU Technical Manual for the TIU NIGHTLY 
 TASK.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Add documentation and scheduling instructions to the TIU Technical Manual 
 for the TIU NIGHTLY TASK.
  
  
 4) HD0000000449777 - Unable to sign as additional signer due to blank
 character string.
  
 Problem:
 --------
 After installing this patch, it was determined that Additional Signers
 would be prevented from signing iMED Consent notes because the document
 generated by the iMED Consent application contained some characters that
 are used as the site's blank character string. 
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Modify routine TIULP to bypass the check for blank character strings on
 Administratively Closed documents. Since these notes aren't entered manually,
 scanning them for blank characters is not necessary.
  
 DOCUMENTATION RETRIEVAL:
 ========================
 The revised TIU Technical Manual is available on the ANONYMOUS.SOFTWARE 
 directory at one of the following Office of Information (OI) Field 
 Offices. These files should be retrieved in binary format.
     
 Sites may retrieve documentation in one of the following ways:
    
  (1) The preferred method is to FTP the files from
  download.vista.med.va.gov, which will transmit the files from  the first
  available FTP server.
     
  (2) Sites may also elect to retrieve documentation directly from a  
  specific server as follows:
  
      Albany                ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov
      Hines                 ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov
      Salt Lake City        ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov
     
  The documentation distribution includes:
  
  File Name            Description           Protocol
  ---------            -----------           --------
  tiutm.pdf            TIU Technical Manual  Binary
  
  
 The updated manual will be posted to the VDL immediately after the
 release of the patch.
