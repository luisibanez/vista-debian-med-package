Subject: ADD DOCMT DATE TO OVERDUE ALERTS, CHANGE SORT ON UNSIGNED/UNCOS REPORT

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch addresses two issues.
  
 First, it adds the date of the document to alerts for OVERDUE signatures.
  
 Second, it changes TIU VISTA MRT Option 
     Unsigned/Uncosigned Report [TIU UNSIGNED/UNCOSIGNED REPORT]
 so that documents requiring a co-signature are listed by the expected 
 cosigner rather than the author and appear under the service of
 the expected cosigner.
  
  
 Patch Components
 ================
  
 Patient Safety Issues (PSIs)
 -----------------------------
  
 PSI 1005 'CPRS "Alert Date/Time" notification column for TIU alerts does 
 not reflect when the alert originated but rather the last time the TIU 
 NIGHLY TASK option ran'
  
 OVERDUE for Signature alerts are regenerated regularly by a nightly 
 task.  The date of the alert is the date it was regenerated, with no 
 indication to the clinician of how long a document has remained unsigned. 
 This makes it difficult for a clinician to prioritize the order in which 
 to respond to alerts.
  
 Patch TIU*1*259 makes this change by adding the Date of the Note itself to
 the message portion of the alert for all OVERDUE for SIGNATURE alerts:
 OVERDUE for SIGNATURE, OVERDUE for COSIGNATURE, and OVERDUE for ADDITIONAL
 SIGNATURE alerts.
  
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview
 ---------------------------
  
 1.      HD 265128 - TIU UNSIGNED ADDITIONAL SIGNER ALERTS DO NOT RETAIN 
 THE DATE/TIME LISTED AS ADDTIONAL SIGNER.  
  
 Problem:
 -------
 OVERDUE for Signature alerts are regenerated regularly by a nightly 
 task.  The date of the alert is the date it was regenerated, with no 
 indication to the clinician of how long a document has remained unsigned.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 The date of the note itself has been added to the message portion of the 
 alert.  Example:
     Unsigned PAIN NOTE Dated 10/03/08 OVERDUE for SIGNATURE
 Patch TIU*1*259 makes this change for all OVERDUE for SIGNATURE alerts: 
 OVERDUE for SIGNATURE, OVERDUE for COSIGNATURE, and OVERDUE for 
 ADDITIONAL SIGNATURE alerts.
  
 This solution was discussed and agreed upon by the CPRS Clinical 
 Workgroup in their 2/25/09 meeting.
  
 2.      HD 405787 Unsigned/Uncosigned Report always looks at the 
 Service/Section of the author of the note
  
 Problem:
 -------
 The problem concerns TIU VISTA Option Unsigned/Uncosigned Report [TIU 
 UNSIGNED/UNCOSIGNED REPORT] on the menu: Text Integration Utilities (MRT) 
 [TIU MAIN MENU MRT].
 In the Unsigned/Uncosigned Report, an uncosigned document is listed 
 by the author under the service of the author instead of the expected
 cosigner.
  
 Resolution:
 ----------
 An uncosigned document is now listed by the expected cosigner under the
 service of the expected cosigner.
