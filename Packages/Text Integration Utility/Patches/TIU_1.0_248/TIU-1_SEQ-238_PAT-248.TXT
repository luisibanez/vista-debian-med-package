Subject: CHANGE SECURITY FOR THE TIU OPTION MISSING TEXT CLEANUP

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 TIU option Missing Text Cleanup deletes/retracts documents from file #8925
 that do not have a "TEXT" node for the note.  Since only certain people
 have permission to delete/retract notes the use of this option should also
 be controlled.
  
 This problem is being tracked with Patient Safety PSPO 1093.

 Associated Remedy Ticket:
 =========================
 HD0000000277123  Note Retraction
  
 Participating Test Sites:
 =========================
 TBD
  
 Remedy Overview:
 ================
  
 Problem: When running option Missing Text Cleanup, notes with no "TEXT" 
 node in file #8925 are deleted/retracted.  Since only users that hold
 Chief, MIS or Chief, HIM user class in the Authorization/Subscription
 (USR) package should be allowed to delete/retract a note, restrictions
 need to be made on this option.
  
 Some sites use user class Chief, HIM instead of Chief, MIS.  See patch 
 USR*1*31.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 Create a security key named TIU MISSING TEXT CLEAN.  This security key 
 will be needed to run option Missing Text Cleanup.  The key should only 
 be assigned to holders of user class Chief,MIS or Chief, HIM in the 
 Authorization/Subscription package.
  
 *************************************NOTE******************************
 Granting condition in Allocation of security key TIU MISSING TEXT CLEAN 
 contains code that checks to see if the person being assigned the key has 
 USR user class CHIEF, MIS or CHIEF, HIM.  If they do not have it you 
 cannot assign the security key.
