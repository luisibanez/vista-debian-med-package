 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD0000000195419     <UNDEFINED>PRNTSCRN+5^TIURA2
   
    Problem: 
    --------
    A hard error can occur when running the Review Progress Notes option 
    [TIU OE/RR REVIEW PROG NOTES]. When the option is run and Progress
    Notes are listed to the screen it is possible that notes can be deleted
    from another session after they have been displayed.  If a note that's
    been deleted is selected to print a hard error occurs.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    If a note selected for print from the Review Progress Notes option 
    [TIU OE/RR REVIEW PROG NOTES] has been deleted, allow processing to
    continue which causes the message: 
        "Item # no longer exists, RETURN to continue..." 
    to be displayed.  An error no longer occurs.
  
    Technical Resolution:
    ---------------------
    Modify routine TIURA2, skip selection when the TIU DOCUMENT file 
    (#8925) does not exist.
