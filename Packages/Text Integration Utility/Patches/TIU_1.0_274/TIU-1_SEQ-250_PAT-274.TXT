Category:

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve the following issue: 
 1. When a note exists without text it can be signed in VistA roll/scroll

    as other List Manager options that contain the sign/cosign action, when
    it should not be able to be signed.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1. HD000000600069     Signed notes with no text
  
 PSPO:
 ===== 
 PSPO #2196
  
   
 Problem: 
 --------
 When a note exists without text it can be signed in VistA roll/scroll 
 Progress Notes User Menu [TIU MAIN MENU PN CLINICIAN] options as well as 
 other List Manager options that contain the sign/cosign action. An empty
 note cannot be signed with CPRS and some users were using VistA to sign
 these notes.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 If a note has no text and is attempted to be signed, signing is not allowed and
 the message 'This note contains no text and cannot be signed.' is displayed to
 the user's screen.  This is the same message displayed in CPRS when a note
 without text is attempted to be signed.
  
 Technical Resolution:
 ---------------------
 Modify routines TIURS & TIURS1 to display the message 'This note contains no
 text and cannot be signed.' and not allowing a note without text to be
 signed.  The entry points into the procedures are EDSIG^TIURS & 
 ELSIG^TIURS1.
  
 EDSIG^TIURS is the code executed by TIU BROWSE ACTION SIGN/COSIGN which 
 is the protocol for sign/cosign under the Progress Notes User Menu [TIU
 MAIN MENU PN CLINICIAN] and Integrated Document Management [TIU MAIN MENU 
 MIXED CLINICIAN] options:
  
    - Review Progress Notes by Patient [TIU BROWSE PN CLINICIAN] option
    - Review Progress Notes [TIU OE/RR REVIEW PROG NOTES] option
    - All MY UNSIGNED Progress Notes [TIU REVIEW PN UNSIGNED] option 
      (sign/cosign after browse is selected) 
    - List Notes By Title [TIU LIST NOTES BY TITLE] option (sign/cosign
      after browse is selected)
    - Search by Patient AND Title [TIU SEARCH BY PATIENT/TITLE] option 
      (sign/cosign after browse is selected) 
    - Show Progress Notes Across Patients [TIU REVIEW PN CLINICIAN] option
    - Individual Patient Document [TIU BROWSE DOCUMENT CLINICIAN] option
  
 ELSIG^TIURS1 is the code executed by TIU ACTION SIGN/COSIGN which is the
 protocol for sign/cosign under the Progress Notes User Menu [TIU MAIN 
 MENU PN CLINICIAN] options:
  
    - All MY UNSIGNED Progress Notes [TIU REVIEW PN UNSIGNED] option 
    - List Notes By Title [TIU LIST NOTES BY TITLE] option
    - Search by Patient AND Title [TIU SEARCH BY PATIENT/TITLE] option
