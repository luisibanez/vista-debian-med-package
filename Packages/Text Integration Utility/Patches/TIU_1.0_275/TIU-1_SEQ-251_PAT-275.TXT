Subject: USH LEGAL SOLUTION

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement ()
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch addressed the Under Secretary of Health (USH) legal solution.  
 The legal solution impacts the High Risk Mental Health Patient - National 
 Reminder and Flag (HRMHP) project.  A new national category 1 Patient 
 Record Flag (PRF) will provide a tool to inform all Veteran 
 Administration (VA) caregivers of special guidelines that must be 
 followed when documenting notes or dealing with the patient.  This flag 
 will require special permissions in order to be assigned to a patient and 
 once assigned it cannot be modified or inactivated other than allowing 
 the reassignment of the owning facility.
  
 This patch TIU*1.0*275 will install one new Title into the TIU DOCUMENT 
 DEFINITION file (#8925.1): PATIENT RECORD FLAG CATEGORY I - URGENT 
 ADDRESS AS FEMALE which is only to be used with the new "URGENT    ADDRESS
 AS FEMALE" Patient Record Flag.
  
 Patch DG*5.3*864 will install the new Patient Record Flag.  The new PRF 
 must only be used with the guidance from the Office of Under Secretary of 
 Health on a patient-by-patient basis.  It may not be used for any other 
 purpose or patient.  The text used during the assignment will be based on 
 very specific pre-defined text provided by the Office of the Under 
 Secretary of Health.  Once the patient is assigned the "URGENT    ADDRESS 
 AS FEMALE" PRF and the flag is activated, the PRF cannot be inactivated
 for the patient.

 Patch Installation:
  
 Pre/Post Installation Overview
 ------------------------------
 TIU*1.0*275 consists of one post-install routine that will install the 
 new title into the TIU DOCUMENT DEFINITION file (#8925.1). A message will
 be written to screen and also captured in the install log as to whether or
 not the title was successfully created. If a title already exists with 
 the same name, it will be overwritten by the new title.
  
 The routine TIUPS275 contains the POST install actions for this patch.  
 This routine may be deleted from the system if storage space is a 
 concern.  Local IT staff should consider keeping a copy of TIUPS275 as it
