 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)  INC000000069426     Completed docs showing in TIU reports
   
 Problem: 
 ========
 When a user goes into the Progress Notes User Menu [TIU MAIN MENU PN 
 CLINICIAN] option and selects the All My Unsigned Progress Notes [TIU 
 REVIEW PN UNSIGNED] option, a display of Progress Notes is shown to the 
 user. At the bottom of the screen the user is given several choices of 
 Actions to perform next. One of those actions is to CHANGE VIEW. This 
 allows the user to change the view they see on the screen after answering 
 several questions; Status, Progress Notes Types, and Search Categories. 
 If, while the user is answering those questions, they want to go back and 
 change a previous answer, they use "^" key and are shown the previous 
 question to change their input. This defect reported occurs when the 
 user  uses the "^" to backup in order to change the Select Status from 
 the original selected status to a different status, the report will show 
 both selected statuses, the originally selected one, and the one they 
 just selected.
  
 For example, if the original Select Status was UNSIGNED, the user enters 
 "^" to back up to change this selection to COMPLETED.  The ending result 
 was a report that displays both COMPLETED and UNSIGNED statuses.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The variable STATUS is not getting cleared out when the "^" is used.  Therefore
 data is still in this variable and when it is set with the new value it is 
 actually concatenating the data to whatever value is already there, 
 instead of replacing it.
  
 To fix this issue, the variable STATUS will be killed at the beginning of the
 STATUS tag in routine TIUR.

     Duplicate(s)
     INC000000727292     <SUBSCRIPT>GETFLD+2^TIUSRVF 
  
 Problem: 
 ========
 Templates that are used in TIU are stored in the TIU TEMPLATE (#8927) 
 file. Each template field in TIU TEMPLATE file needs to have a matching 
 entry in the TIU TEMPLATE FIELD (#8927.1) File. The entries in TIU 
 TEMPLATE FIELD file describe the attributes of the field; Type, Length, 
 Required, Allowed Items, and Max/Min Values. When the user goes in to 
 delete a template field using Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) FileMan 
 and editing the TIU TEMPLATE file, it may appear that it is deleted but 
 in actuality only the descriptive part of the field is deleted. This 
 blank descriptive field is one of the causes for the subscript error, the 
 other is when the descriptive field does not have a corresponding entry 
 in the TIU TEMPLATE FIELD file. Then if you attempt to enter a new 
 Progress Note using this corrupt template in CPRS  you will get a 
 subscript error and be kicked out of CPRS with a Server Error displayed. 
 When you look in the error log in VistA, you will see an error entry 
 similar to: <SUBSCRIPT>GETFLD+2^TIUSRVF ^TIU(8927.1.
  
 For example, TIU TEMPLATE file may have an entry named HEPATITIS. This 
 template contains many fields. One of those is named HEPATITIS PROBLEM2.  
 If a user deletes {FLD: HEPATITIS PROBLEM2}, a review of the global 
 indicates {FLD:} remains. This remaining portion results in an error in 
 CPRS when the template is used. Also, if the TIU TEMPLATE FIELD File is 
 missing an entry for HEPATITIS PROBLEM2, this will also cause the error 
 to occur when the template is used in CPRS.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The only correction we can make here is to bulletproof the code in 
 routine TIUSRVF so the users are not knocked out of the system.
