 Remedy Overview:
 ================     
 1. HD0000000370490 - Columns do not line up
  
    Problem:
    --------
    In the Vitals Measurement GUI, under the 'Reports' menu, the column
    headings in the Graph Report do not line up properly but the data in
    the report is fine.  The same report can be found under the 'File' menu
    under the CPRS/Vitals Lite.
       
    Resolution:
    -----------   
    A modification will be made to the code to align the columns headings
    correctly. 
      
  
 2. HD0000000342434 - Default Vitals Qualifiers Display
  
    Patient Safety Issue: PSPO #1630
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Currently, the 'Show Qualifier' box in Vitals/GUI/File/User Option 
    is not checked as default for new users causing qualifiers to not
    display in the data grid table display. Users who have changed this 
    setting by selecting the 'Show Qualifier' box do see the qualifiers.
    This affects the display in both Vitals GUI and CPRS/Vitals Lite.
          
    Resolution:
    -----------
    A modification will be made to the code to mark the 'Show Qualifiers'
    box as checked so qualifiers will display as a default for all users.
    A post-init routine (GMV26PST) will be run as part of the patch install
    to set the Vitals GUI and CPRS Vitals Lite parameters:
      
    ABNORMALQUALIFIERS
    NORMALQUALIFIERS
    ABNORMALTEXTCOLOR
    NORMALTEXCOLOR
    CanvasAbnormal
    CanvasNormal
    
  
 3. HD0000000370807 - Weight/Height Warning Message
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When using Vitals GUI, if the user selects multiple patients to enter
    weight and the weight entered for the 2nd  or any subsequent patient
    is 20% or more off from the 1st patient , a erroneous error message is
    displayed alerting the user to the weight variation.  The error message
    should only be displayed per patient and not compare patient to
    patient.
            
    Resolution:
    -----------   
    A modification will be made to the code to not display the erroneous
    message by reworking the weight calculation to review only the patient
    in focus.
      
  
 4. HD0000000370106 - Units as Drop Down list in Vitals GUI
  
    Problem:
    --------
    Upon entering the Vitals Measurement GUI, the user places a check 
    inside the Units box to the right of the 'weight' box to change it from
    LB to KG and then enters a value in KG, the warning box is presented
    with the incorrect unit of measure when the user attempts to save the
    data.
  
    The same thing happens with IN vs CM for 'height'.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------   
    A modification will be made in the Vitals GUI to display the correct
    unit of measure.

 Installation Instructions:
 ==========================
 1.  This patch can be installed with users on the system. However, this
     patch should be installed when use of the software is low.
     Installation should take less than 2 minutes.
  
 2.  Load the Transport Global.
  
 3. (Optional) Run the following KIDS options before installing the patch:
  
               Compare Transport Global to Current System
               Verify Checksums in Transport Global
               Backup a Transport Global
  
 4.  Install the Build GMRV*5.0*26.
  
     At the 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the install' prompt, 
     answer NO.
  
     At the 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu Options, and
     Protocols?' prompt answer YES.
  
     Place the following option 'out of order':
  
     Vitals/Measurements GUI Application [GMV V/M GUI]
  
 5.  Move the routines to other CPUs if appropriate.
  
 6.  Unzip the VITL5_P26.ZIP file and move the VITL5_P26.EXE file to an
     appropriate directory and/or workstations.
  
 7.  Install the new Vitals executable files.
     a) Double-click on the VITL5_P26.EXE file to start the InstallShield 
        Wizard.
     b) Follow the Wizard instructions. When prompted to "Modify, repair, 
        or remove the program." select "Repair".
     c) Follow the wizard instructions to completion.
  
 8.  The installation wizard creates the following files:
  
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Vitals.exe
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\VitalsManager.exe
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Help\Vitals.hlp
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Help\Vitals.cnt
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Help\VitalsManager.hlp
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Help\VitalsManager.cnt
     C:\Program Files\vista\Vitals\Help\Roboex32.dll
  
     If you are running the Clinician and Manager files from individual
     workstations and you want to push the files, you should include these
     files in your script.
  
 9.  Place the GMV_VitalsViewEnter.dll, GMV_VitalsViewEnter.hlp, and
     GMV_VitalsViewEnter.cnt files in the "Program Files\vista\Common Files
     directory of the workstation where CPRS is located. For example, if
     CPRS is installed on the C:\ drive, the three DLL related files must
     be copied into the C:\ Program Files\vista\Common Files directory. If
     this directory path does not exist, you must create it.
  
     IMPORTANT: These files must not be installed in the same folder as
     CPRS.  CPRS looks for these three files in the specified directory
     path. If CPRS cannot find the DLL and its supporting files, the users
     will not be able to enter patient vitals/measurements data.
