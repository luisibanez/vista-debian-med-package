Category: 
  - Routine
  - Other

Description:
============

 This patch is to correct potential oversights in clinical reminders where
 Veterans could be unaware of homeless programs by implementing the
 VA-HOMELESSNESS SCREENING reminder.  Also, drug therapy complications 
 are addressed by clinical reminder LIPID STATIN RX CVD/DM.
     
 NOTE:
 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 Because of the urgency of this patch to be released according to the

 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ===============
 1. HD000000734950 - VA-HOMELESSNESS SCREENING
    
 Problem:
 --------
 The Government has mandated that a VA homeless screening be implemented 
 as follows:
  
 The objectives of the VA-Homelessness Screening clinical reminder are to:
 (a)identify Veterans and their families who are at imminent risk of
 homelessness or who have very recently become homeless; (b)ensure that
 those who are at-risk or who are currently homeless are referred for
 appropriate assistance; and (c)update documentation in the medical record
 regarding the current living situation for these at-risk Veterans. It is
 anticipated that this new screening reminder will help to identify
 Veterans who might not otherwise seek assistance or who may not be aware
 of homeless programs offered by VHA. The VA-HOMELESSNESS SCREENING
 reminder is a NATIONALLY-MANDATED reminder - similar to the VA-TBI and
 VA-IRAQ&AFGHAN POST DEPLOYMENT screening reminders.  It MUST be
 placed on the Cover Sheet at all facilities and is intended to be 
 completed by any staff person.
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 Created the necessary VA-Homelessness Screening reminder
   
 2. HD000000765018 - VA-LIPID STATIN RX CVD/DM (VER 1.0)
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Recent analysis of cardiovascular prevention studies, as well as the 
 growing appreciation of the downsides of aggressive lipid treatment
 with high dose statins or non-statin cholesterol-lowering medications,
 have raised concerns about performance measures for lipid management
 based solely on achieving a target value of Low Density Lipoprotein
 Cholesterol(LDL-C)(Hayward and Krumholz, 2012).
    
 The use of statin drugs can provide significant patient benefit even if
 LDL-C values remain above 100. Professional societies now recommend
 that the adequacy of lipid management be judged by the appropriateness
 of the therapy and not solely by LDL value(ACCF/AHA/AMA-PCPI,2011).
 Performance measures that recognize appropriate clinical prescribing
 provide a better balance of patient benefit and risk and may reduce
 complications of overzealous drug therapy(e.g., muscle breakdown).
    
 Resolution:
 -----------
 This national clinical reminder has been created to address the concerns
 concerns outlined above and to support updated VHA Performance Measures
 for FY12 and FY13(ihd18hns and dmg25hs) that assess LDL-C values in
 patients with cardiovascular disease or with diabetes mellitus or
 whether the patient is on at least a moderate dose of a statin medication.
 The reminder replaces previous national lipid reminders that were based
 on threshold LDL-C values.  It was created by the VHA National Clinical
 Reminders Committee with input from multiple national VA experts on lipid
 management, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and quality
 measurement.  The reminder is intended to be used by providers with 
 prescribing privileges.
