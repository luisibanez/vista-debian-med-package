Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The VA-ECOE templates project is a product developed in collaboration 
 with the VA Epilepsy Center of Excellence (ECOE), VHA Informatics Council 
 (VHA IC), National Clinical Reminder Committee (NCRC), National HIMS 
 Office, VistA Maintenance Program (VMP), Nashville Usability Testing 
 staff, and Miami VA Healthcare System staff, which provides guidance for 
 the collection of the information of Veterans diagnosed with epilepsy to 
 support uniform care and epilepsy surveillance. The templates are vital 
 for quality control and research data for improvement in specialized 
 epilepsy health care.
 The templates incorporate all of the American Academy of Neurology 
 Epilepsy Quality Measures and the National Institute of Health 
 recommended Common Data Elements. The database will be maintained by the 
 VA Epilepsy Centers of Excellence Program implemented in 2008 by Public 
 Law 110-387 mandate. Thanks to the Southeast ECoE team led by Dr. Aatif 
 Husain SE ECoE Regional Clinical Director and Pamela Kelly the SE ECoE 
 Regional Director, for facilitating the development and implementation of 
 this tool.
