 REMEDY OVERVIEW:
 ================
 1.  INC000000755264 - WOMEN'S HEALTH REMINDERS
         
 Problem:
 --------
 Women's Health Care specifically addressing Breast Cancer Screening
 and Cervical Cancer Screening and following VHA Clinical Guidance 
 created National Clinical Reminders in 2005 for sites to be 
 standardized in following Clinical Practice Guidelines.
 Clinical Guidance has changed significantly since 2005.  Current
 MyHealtheVet reminders do not align with the CPRS reminders
 and the readability for the Veterans in the reminders needs
 improvement.  These reminders have not been updated since 2005
 and sites that are  using the reminders may not be meeting 
 current performance measures for Women's Health Care.  This
 patch is needed to update the content to current guidelines.
   
 Resolution:
 -----------
