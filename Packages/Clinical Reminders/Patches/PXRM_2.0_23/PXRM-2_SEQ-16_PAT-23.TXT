Description:
============

 This build is a multi-package build that contains FB*3.5*138
 and PXRM*2.0*23. It supports the third increment for Project ARCH 
 (Access to Care Received Closer to Home).
  
 The Veterans' Mental Health And Other Care Improvements Act Of 2008, 
 Section 403, Public Law 110-387 mandates that the Department of
 Veterans Affairs (VA) conduct a pilot program over three years for
 contract care of eligible Veterans in selected Veterans Integrated
 Service Networks (VISNs).
  
 The Office of Policy Analysis within the Office of the Assistant
 Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning
 (ADUSH/PP) requested the capability to automatically identify all
 Veterans who are eligible for a high visibility Congressionally
 mandated contract care pilot program (named Project ARCH, Access to
 Care Received Closer to Home) in five VISNs (1, 6, 15, 18, and 19).
  
 FB*3.5*138:
 This build adds the PROJECT ARCH REMINDER DELAY field (#38) to the 
 FEE BASIS SITE PARAMETERS file (#161.4) that allows sites to customize
 number of days that the Project ARCH Clinical Reminder will become due
 again after the patient Declines or Refuses services offered. Two new
 options are also installed on the Project ARCH Menu. The ARCH
 Eligibility Data Upload option allows sites to upload the national
 Project ARCH data extract files that contain the updates  for Project
 ARCH Eligibility. The ARCH Clinical Reminder Due Delay option sets
 the value in the new PROJECT ARCH REMINDER DELAY field with a number
 between 1 and 180 days.
  
 PXRM*2*23:
 This build places updated VA-PROJECT ARCH VISN CONTRACT CARE PILOT 
 ELIGIBILITY in the Reminder Exchange file. Updates to this reminder
 include a new Health Factor ARCH-SERVICE NEEDED THIS VISIT REFUSES.
 The updates also include a mandatory checkbox indicating that the 
 patient has signed the consent form when the ARCH-SERVICE NEEDED 
 THIS VISIT CONSENTS Health Factor is selected in the Reminder
 Dialog.
