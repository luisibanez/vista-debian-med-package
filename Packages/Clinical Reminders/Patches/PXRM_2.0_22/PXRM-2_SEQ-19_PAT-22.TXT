Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 The build for this patch is distributed as part of a multi-package build that
 contains PXRM*2.0*22 and OR*3.0*357. The multi-package build name is
 TERATOGENIC MEDICATIONS ORDER CHECKS 1.0. 
  
 This patch releases two new National Reminder Order Checks for placing
 Teratogenic Medications.
  
 This patch also addresses two bug fixes in the Reminder Order Check setup. To
 address these fixes the Reminder Order Check System had to be broken up into
 two files.
  
 File 801 Reminder Order Check Items Group and file 801.1 Reminder Order Check
 Rules.
  
 File 801 contains the grouping of Orderable Items. This file has also been
 modified to allow groups to include entries from the Drugs file, file #50, 
 VA Generic file, file #50.6 and VA Drug Class file, file # 50.605.
  
 File 801.1 contains the Reminder Order Check Rules.
  
 These changes will allow site to modify the Active and Testing Fields for
 National Rules.
  
 This patch also fixes a Mumps error when the select order checks prompt
 times out.
 
 This patch fixes a problem with Reminder Exchange automatically setting a
 dialog item disable field to 1 instead of the packed value.
 
 This patch fixes a problem with Reminder Exchange taking an error when
 installing a dialog item that contains an ICD9 code as an additional 
 finding item.
 
 This patch fixes a problem with the Reminder Definition Inquiry not showing
 usage of Reminder Order Check, if the usage field contains an "O".
  
 To support the two-file structure, the existing menu options have been renamed
 and two new options will be released with this patch.
 
 This patch also contains an update to the VA-RANDOM NUMBER computed finding
 description.
