Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 One aspect of the Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) project
 increases the number of military service episodes from three to an
 unlimited number. It provides new APIs for Clinical Reminders to
 use to get this data. These APIs are used to update the computed
 findings, VA-SERVICE BRANCH and VA-LAST SERVICE SEPARATION DATE
 (which is renamed VA-SERVICE SEPARATION DATES), so they
 can get data for all episodes of service.
 
 A new list type computed finding: VA-OEF/OIF SERVICE (LIST) is also
 included. It can be used to build lists of patients with OEF/OIF
 service.
