Description:
============

 General Overview:
 =================
 This build is part of a multi-package build that contains FB*3.5*119
 and PXRM*2.0*20. It supports the pilot for Project ARCH.
  
 The Veterans' Mental Health And Other Care Improvements Act Of 2008, 
 Section 403, Public Law 110-387 mandates that the Department of
 Veterans  Affairs (VA) conduct a pilot program over three years for
 contract care  of eligible Veterans in selected Veterans Integrated
 Service Networks (VISNs).
  
 The Office of Policy Analysis within the Office of the Assistant
 Deputy  Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning
 (ADUSH/PP) requested the capability to automatically identify all
 Veterans who are eligible  for a high visibility Congressionally
 mandated contract care pilot  program (named Project ARCH, Access to
 Care Received Closer to Home) in  five VISNs (1, 6, 15, 18, and 19).
  
 FB*3.5*119:
 This build adds a new multiple to the Fee Basis file (#161) that
 contains the ARCH eligibility information and creates two new APIs
 that are used by the Clinical Reminder ARCH computed findings.
  
 PXRM*2*20:
 This build places VA-PROJECT ARCH VISN CONTRACT CARE PILOT ELIGIBILITY in
 the Reminder Exchange file. This contains the following new components
 that will be installed during the post-init.

        Backup a Transport Global
  
 3. On the KIDS menu under the 'INSTALLATION' menu, use the following
