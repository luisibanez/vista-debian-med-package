============

 Description:
  
 This informational patch, PRPF*4*2, describes the purpose and contents 
 of VPFS maintenance package VPFS-PKG-1.1.2.2.zip.
  
 Since this HealtheVet application is a centralized application and there 
 are no changes to VistA patches, it is important to note that NO software 
 will need to be installed at VistA facilities.
  
 VPFS-PKG-1.1.2.2.zip package contains the VPFS application ear file 
 (VPFS-app-1.1.2.001.ear), which includes upgrade for the following two 
 dependency components:
 "       Standard Data Services (SDS)v13.0
 "       Kernel Authentication and Authorization for Java (2) Enterprise 
 Edition (KAAJEE)v1.0.1.003
 Note: VPFS currently uses version 9.9 of SDS and 1.0.0.19 of KAAJEE.
 With the release of this new VPFS Package (1.1.2.2), SDS is upgraded to 
 13 and KAAJEE is upgraded to 1.0.1.003.
 Features:
 SDS Upgrade has two major overall objectives. 
 "       Upgrade SDS java API to version 13: 
 "       Upgrade SDS database structure to version 18: 
  
 KAAJEE provides the following high-level features and functionality:
 "       KAAJEE Login Page-Removal of Refresh Button. 
 "       Enhanced Login Functionality:
 "       Added JavaScript code for client-side sorting of Institutions.
 "       Provided Access code; Verify code capability in one line.
 "       Added support for parameter passing of Default Institution and 
 Institution sorting preferences. This addresses the issues of persistent 
 cookies when using Thin Clients and Terminal Servers.
 "       Made the KAAJEE Login Web page more Section 508 friendlier.
 "       Added Sample Web Application-Provide KAAJEE Sample Web 
 Application.
 "       Updated Software Version Support:
 "       Compiled and tested KAAJEE against SDS 13.0.
 "       Compiled and tested KAAJEE against VistALink 1.5.2.004.
  
 Note: VPFS application has been internally tested successfully with the 
 Microsoft browser Internet Explorer version 7.0.
