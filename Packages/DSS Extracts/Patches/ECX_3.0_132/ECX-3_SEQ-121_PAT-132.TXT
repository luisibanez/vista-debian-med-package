Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened 3 day compliance date.  This patch must be          **
 ** installed in all systems within the 3 day compliance requirement. **
 ** This patch must be installed on or before 11/4/11 so that the     **
 ** October DSS Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal    **
 ** Year 12 logic.  Failure to comply with the installation date      **
 ** will cause delays in extracting and reporting data.               **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The DSS FY12 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to a DSS 
 database residing at the AITC. This transfer is accomplished through a 
 set of extract routines, intermediate files, and transmission routines. 
 Data from VistA packages is stored by the extract routines in the 
 intermediate files, where it is temporarily available for local use and 
 auditing. The data is then transmitted to the AITC, where it is formatted 
 and uploaded into commercial software. 
  
  
 Included in the DSS FY12 scope are:
      o       DSS Extract field additions and modifications
      o       Disabling of DSS Extracts
      o       DSS menu additions, modifications and deletions
      o       New DSS report and report modifications
  
 Not included are the modifications to the AITC DSS software, the AITC 
 legacy extracts, and Vendor software.
  
 Note:  The BCM extract has not been deployed nationally.  This extract is 
 still a work in progress.  Modifications to this extract are documented 
 and will continue being tested by a select group chosen by the DSO.
  
  
 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================

 21.  Add Provider #5 NPI to ECQ and ECS Extracts.     
  
 22.  Change Diagnosis to Principal Diagnosis in ADM Extract.
  
 23.  Modify the PRO Extract programming to create a new Feeder Location
      value for Home Oxygen records.  Add a Feeder Location for Home Oxygen
      (XXXXXHO2) when the "NPPD New Code" =  800 x (where the x represents
      a letter code and XXXXX represents the 3 to 5 character station code
      plus the characters H, O and 2.).
        
 24.  PRO Extract error reporting change.
      The Prosthetics DSS Extract (which creates File 727.826) has been 
      modified to remove sending of an error message when the HPCS field is
      null.
  
 25.  Update reports for PRO Extract.
      The following reports were modified to include the reporting of 
      'rental' type Feeder Key listings:
            o Prosthetics (PRO) YTD HCPCS Report [ECX PRO YTD REPORT]
            o Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit [ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT]
  
 26.  Disable NUR Extract and associated reports.    
      These updates will occur during the post-install and will change the
      INACTIVE field (#13) of the EXTRACT DEFINITION file (#727.1) to
      "YES", indicating NUR is inactive. NUR will be removed from the 
      'Print Feeder Keys' and 'Print Feeder Location' reports. Options
      'Nursing Extract' [ECXNURS] will be removed from the 'Package
      Extracts' menu and 'Nursing (NUR) Extract Audit' [ECX NUR SOURCE
      AUDIT] will be removed from the 'Extract Audit Reports' menu.  Both
      options are marked 'out of order'.
  
 27.  Remove DEN from listing in the 'Print Feeder Location' report.  
  
 28.  Add new Admit Source field to ADM Extract.
      A new field will be added to the Admission Extract (#727.802) 
      file called ADMIT SOURCE (#91).  This is the PTF CODE field (#.01)
      value of the SOURCE OF ADMISSION file (#45.1).
  
 29.  Modify LAR Report in order to list test result 20 characters long.
  
 30.  Create new Clinic Review Report. 
      'EXPORT TO TEXT FILE FOR SPREADSHEET USE' is a new selection under 
      the 'Clinics and DSS Stop Codes Print' option.  This selection (X)
      will allow you to export the CLINICS AND STOP CODES (#728.44) File
      to a text file for use in spreadsheets.  A template .xls worksheet
      document is included in the [Documentation Retrieval] Section for
      exporting this text file into.
  
 31.  Correct Programming in BCM Extract. 
  
 32.  Correct Data Dictionary changes in LAB Extract.
      The Technical Description of the DATA NAME (#45) field of the 
      LABORATORY EXTRACT (#727.813) File has been edited to retrieving the 
      DATA NAME instead of the TEST NAME.
  
 33.  Correct Data Dictionary changes in EVENT CAPTURE LOCAL Extract.
      The Data Dictionary descriptions for PROVIDER (#16), PROVIDER #2
      (#18), and PROVIDER #3 (#20) fields in the EVENT CAPTURE LOCAL
      (#727.815) File have been edited to display the correct retrieval 
      descriptions.
  
 34.  Correct Data Dictionary changes in QUASAR Extract. 
      The Data Dictionary descriptions for PROVIDER (#16), PROVIDER #2
      (#18), and PROVIDER #3 (#20) fields in the QUASAR (#727.825) File
      have been edited to display the correct retrieval descriptions.
  
 35.  Modify logic to retrieve LAB LOINC Code.
      With the LEX*2*75 patch (estimated, spring 2012 release), custodial
      transition of the LAB LOINC file (#95.3) will migrate from Legacy LAB
      to Standards and Terminology Services (STS). API(s) are being
      distributed for accessing the LAB LOINC file (#95.3). This supports
      Legacy LAB's encapsulation efforts and STS's LOINC Deployment
      efforts. This patch modifies the call to retrieve the LOINC Code to
      look for new Lexicon routine (LEXLR) first.  If Lexicon routine does
      not exist, follow existing path to retrieve the LOINC code directly
      from file #95.3.
  
 36.  Add Date of Birth (#121) field to Surgery (SUR) Extract (#727.811) 
      file.
