Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/5/12 so that the October DSS    **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 13 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The DSS FY13 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to a DSS 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 Included in the DSS FY13 scope are: 
      o       DSS Extract field additions and modifications
      o       DSS menu additions, modifications and deletions
      o       New DSS reports and report modifications
      o       Implementation of the new and/or deleted extracts
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.
  
 ***********************************************************************
 *NOTE: The BCM extract will be activated with this patch release.     *
 *      Please remember to populate the DSS-BCM mail group so that     *
 *      messages related to the BCM extract are received.              *

      menu).
  
 18.  Change BCM to produce only those records not already recorded in IVP 
      or UDP.  BCM logic should review the IVP and UDP extracts being run
      for the month being extracted and the month prior to that.  Records
      not in IVP or UDP will be included in the BCM extract. This will
      allow the capture of pharmacy transactions not previously collected:
      1) WDDE transactions, 2) changes after UDP is pulled, 3) Ward Stock,
      and 4) Narcotics.

      to calculate Cost by multiplying the Average Drug Cost per Unit from

 27.  Change the prompts of the Pharmacy Volume Edit option for UDP so 
      that the input needed from the user is clear.
  
 28.  Add additional prompts, to the existing option, to help the user 
      determine the correct record sequence number specific to the patient
      and UDP extract.

      the Outpatient Pharmacy files for use in the IVP Extract.

 34.  Add a new column for DSS TEST NAME to the LAR Extract Audit.
  
 35.  Change LAB RESULTS (LAR) extract logic so that it includes missing
      workload.  Currently, lab tests are counted if they are accessioned
      in the extract month and have a result entered.  If the test hasn't 
      been resulted, it was being skipped.  Now, if a test is accessioned
      but hasn't yet been resulted, it's put on a list to be considered on
      next month's extract.  Tests now accessioned at the end of the 
      month, that are resulted in the next month, will no longer be
      skipped.  This change will take place when patch LR*5.2*420 is
      installed.
  
 36.  Add PRO Extract information to the Print Feeder Keys report option 
      in the Maintenance Menu.
  
 37.  Add PRO Extract information to the Print Feeder Location report 
      option in the Maintenance Menu.
  
 38.  Rename the audit from LBB Extract Audit to LBB Pre-Extract Audit.
  
 39.  Add a note at the beginning when the LBB Pre-Extract audit is 
      accessed to clarify and emphasize to users that this extract audit
      must be done prior to the generation extract.
  
 40.  Remove Social Security Number (SSN) filtering of SSNs that begin 
      with 8 or 9.  Registration is currently validating SSNs and
      additional filtering is no longer required.
  
 41.  Data Dictionary Updates as requested by the DSO.
