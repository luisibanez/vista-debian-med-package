Description:
============

 Since the release of the DSS FY13 updates patch, ECX*3*136, three problems
 have been reported.  The first problem is with the Laboratory Blood Bank 
 (LBB) Pre-Extract Audit report.  The second problem is related to IV costs
 as they appear on both the Pharmacy Extracts Unusual Volume Report and in 
 the IV Extract (IVP). The third problem is the feeder key for the BCMA 
 extract is using the wrong file for drug identification.
  
  
 Problem #1: The Laboratory Blood Bank (LBB) Pre-Extract Audit report.

   4) HD0000000775518
  
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The lab blood bank pre-extract report only displays the report header
   even when there is data to be displayed.
  
   
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Modified routine ECXPLBB to correctly display the data on the
   report.
  
 Problem #2: IV cost issue on the unusual volume report and in the IVP 
             extract.
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY: 
   ==================
   N/A
  
   ASSOCIATED NSR:
   ===============
   N/A
  
   Problem:
   --------
   When determining total IV cost per patient the calculation is average
   cost per unit times the number of units times the number of times given.
   When obtaining the average cost per unit it was possible to get the
   wrong value for the drug if the drug was associated with an inactive
   entry in the IV ADDITIVES file (#52.6).  The wrong average cost per
   unit was causing unusually large dollar amounts to appear on the
   report and in the extract.
  
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   The correct average cost per unit is now being applied to the 
   calculation so that the correct costs are reported on both the unusual
   volume report as well as the IVP extract. Routine ECXAPHA2 was updated
   to fix the issue in the unusual volume report and routine ECXPIVDN was
   updated to fix the issue in the IV extract.
  
  
 Problem #3: Incorrect data used in feeder key creation.
  
   ASSOCIATED REMEDY:

   ASSOCIATED NSR:

   N/A
  
   Problem:
   --------
   The first portion of the Feeder Key value in the BCMA Extract (BCM) 
   corresponds to the drug IEN.  For all other pharmacy related DSS
   extracts, the IEN is taken from the VA PRODUCT file (#50.68). Currently,
   the IEN being used in the Feeder Key for the BCM extract is being
   retrieved from the DRUG file (#50), which is not accurate for the
   purposes of this extract.
  
   Resolution:
   -----------
   Routine ECXBCM has been updated so that the IEN included in the Feeder
   Key for the BCM Extract is now being retrieved from the VA PRODUCT file
   (#50.68).  As a result of needing to change the file associated with the
   DRUG IEN (#42) field of the BCMA EXTRACT (#727.833) file, post-install
   routine ECX3P143 will purge all existing BCMA extracts from the system
   so that data in the DRUG IEN field will be correct going forward.
