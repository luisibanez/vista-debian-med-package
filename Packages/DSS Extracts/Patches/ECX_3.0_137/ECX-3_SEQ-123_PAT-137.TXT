Subject: DSS Prosthetics Report Fixes

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 One of the changes made in the recently released DSS FY 2012 updates 
 patch was the addition of HO2 as a feeder location for the prosthetics 
 extracts. 
  
 Here is the description of the change from patch ECX*3*132:
  
 Modify the PRO Extract programming to create a new Feeder Location value
 for Home Oxygen records.  Add a Feeder Location for Home Oxygen (XXXXXHO2)
 when the "NPPD New Code" =  800 x (where the x represents a letter code
 and XXXXX represents the 3 to 5 character station code plus the characters
 H, O and 2.).
  
 This change caused an error to be encountered when running the
 Prosthetics (PRO) YTD HCPCS Report [ECX PRO YTD REPORT] option.

 Remedy Overview:
 ================
 1)  HD0000000554882    Prosthetics (PRO) YTD HCPCS Report [ECX PRO YTD 
                        REPORT] causes error 
  
 Problem:
 --------
 a). Since the release of ECX*3.0*132, it has been discovered that in rare 
 circumstances, an error can be received when using the Prosthetics (PRO) 
 YTD HCPCS Report [ECX PRO YTD REPORT].  This error occurs when the first 
 record in the report has a feeder location that contains HO2.  In 
 reviewing the issue, it was also discovered that a feeder location 
 containing HO2 could also be incorrectly categorized on the report, 
 depending on the feeder location of the record processed just before the 
 HO2 type record. 
  
 b). Also, during the review of the remedy ticket, it was discovered that  
 the Prosthetics (PRO) Extract Audit [ECX PRO SOURCE AUDIT] report could 
 potentially miscount entries that had HO2 as part of the feeder 
 location.  This would only happen in cases where the user has more than 
 one division assigned in the NEW PERSON file (#200), the site has more
 than one division identified in the PROSTHETICS SITE PARAMETERS file
 (#669.9) and the user selects a specific division to appear on the
 report.  Under those circumstances, it's possible for entries associated
 with HO2 to not be counted and displayed on the audit report.
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
 a). The report has now been modified to account for the HO2 feeder
 locations and will correctly put them in the right category for
 reporting purposes.
  
 b). The report has been modified to account for entries related to HO2
 and will properly identify and include them on the report.
  
  
 2)  HD0000000535986    Incorrect build date on 2nd line of routine
  
 Problem:
 ========
 There is an incorrect build date on the second line of routine ECXUPRO1.
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The second line of routine ECXUPRO1 was modified to have the correct 
 build date of Dec 22, 1997.
