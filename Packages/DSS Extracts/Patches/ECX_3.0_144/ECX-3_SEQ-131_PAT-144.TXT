Description:
============

 ***********************************************************************
 ** This patch is being released with an Emergency status because of  **
 ** the shortened compliance date and must be installed in all        **
 ** systems no later than the compliance requirement date. This patch **
 ** must be installed on or before 11/05/13 so that the October DSS   **
 ** Extracts can be generated using the updated Fiscal Year 14 logic. **
 ** Failure to comply with the installation date will cause delays in **
 ** extracting and reporting data.                                    **
 ***********************************************************************
  
 The DSS FY14 Extract Enhancements shall provide the means of exporting 
 data from selected VistA software modules and transmitting it to a DSS 
 database residing at the AITC (Austin Information Technology Center). This
 transfer is accomplished through a set of extract routines, intermediate
 files, and transmission routines. Data from VistA packages is stored by
 the extract routines in the intermediate files, where it is temporarily
 available for local use and auditing. The data is then transmitted to the
 AITC, where it is formatted and uploaded into commercial software.
  
 Included in the DSS FY14 scope are: 
      o       DSS Extract field additions and modifications
      o       DSS menu additions and modifications
      o       New DSS reports and report modifications
      o       Changes related to user, technical, or business 
              documentation.

 The following is a list of product features for this release:
 =============================================================
 1.  Lock down of the NATIONAL CLINIC file (#728.441).  User 
     additions/edits are no longer allowed.
  
 2.  DATE OF BIRTH field (#121) in the SURGERY EXTRACT file (#727.811) 
     file has been updated to match the DATE OF BIRTH field description in 
     other extract files
  
 3.  Add a new field called 4CHAR to the ECS and ECQ extracts.
  
 4.  Convert non-standard race values to their standardized equivalent and
     store in the RACE 1 field for affected extract files when no RACE 1 
     information is available. Conversion is based on a matrix of
     non-standard values provided by the VHA Office of Informatics and 
     Analytics (OIA) Health Information Governance Office (HIG) VHA Data
     Quality Program.
  
 5.  Correct solutions cost logic on the IVP extract.
  
 6.  Modify the clinic worksheet options so the create and unreviewed 
     report options are now separated.  Running one option will no longer
     force the other action to occur.  When running any clinic worksheet
     report, the user will be informed of the last run date for the create
     option.  The report will now indicate "last approved" date instead of
     "last reviewed" date.  The report will now include the print date.
  
 7.  The PRO extract audit report will now include the NPPD Entry Date.
  
 8.  The Clinic Review Report will now allow the user to export active
     clinics, inactive clinics or unreviewed clinics in addition to the
     previously existing choice of all clinics.
  
 9.  Onscreen instructions for capturing exportable data have been
     updated to account for the use of reflections terminal emulators.
  
 10. Add an Unusual Cost Report for Pharmacy extracts.  This report may be
     output in a caret delimited format for exporting.
  
 11. Add BCM as a selection in the Pharmacy Unusual Volume Report.  Also,
     allow the report to be output in a caret delimited format for 
     exporting.
  
 12. Modify the DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Clinics report to display the
     associated 4 character code.
  
 13. Modify the DSS Clinic & Stop Codes Validity Report to validate and
     report any inactive 4 character code.
  
 14. Correct the IV solutions cost logic on the Pharmacy Unusual Volume
     Report.
  
 15. Add a new field VIETNAM to the CLI, ECS, ECQ, PRO, PRE and SUR
     extracts.
  
 16. Add a new field ENCOUNTER SC to the ADM, BCM, CLI, ECS, ECQ, IVP,
     LAB, LAR, LBB, PRE, PRO, RAD and UDP extracts. Modified existing
     ENCOUNTER SC field in the SUR extract.
  
 17. Add new fields PROVIDER #6, PROVIDER #6 NPI, PROVIDER #6 PERSON
     CLASS, PROVIDER #7, PROVIDER #7 NPI and PROVIDER #7 PERSON CLASS to
     the ECQ and ECS extracts.
  
 18. Add new fields SECONDARY PROVIDER #6, SECONDARY PROVIDER #6 PC,
     SECONDARY PROVIDER #6 NPI, SECONDARY PROVIDER #7, SECONDARY
     PROVIDER #7 PC, and SECONDARY PROVIDER #7 NPI to the CLI extract.
  
 19. Add new fields IV ADDITIVE COST, IV SOLUTION COST, and DRUG COST
     to the BCM extract.
  
 20. Modify package extracts option so that the user may re-run an
     extract without IRM/IT assistance when the extract system indicates
     the extract is already running or when re-running the same date 
     range.
  
 21. Modify logic for the DEA, SPECIAL HDLG field to now include schedules 
     1-5, in addition to investigational status (denoted by an "I") for the
     UDP and BCM extracts.  Drug schedules take precedence over
     investigational status when both are associated with the drug.  Rename
     the INVESTIGATIONAL field in both extracts to DEA, SPECIAL HDLG.
  
  
 22. Exportability of the DSS Identifier Non-Conforming Report.  Report
     can now be displayed in a caret delimited format.
  
 23. Exportability of the DSS Clinics and Stop Codes Validity Report.  
     Report can now be displayed in a caret delimited format.

     be displayed in a caret delimited format.
  
 33. Modify the extract transmission process so that any field that
     contains a tilde (~) character will have the tilde removed.
  
 34. Add a new field called CONCURRENT CASE to the SUR extract.
  
 35. Rename fields BCMA Drug Dispensed, BCMA Dose Given, BCMA Unit of
     Administration, and BCMA ICU Flag to PLACEHOLDER in the IVP and UDP
     extracts.

     CODE #1, OTHER POSTOP ICD-10 CODE #2, OTHER POSTOP ICD-10 CODE #3,
