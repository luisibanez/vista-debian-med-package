Subject: Release of VBECS 1.6.1 Server Patch

Category: 
  - Informational

Description:
============

 This information patch serves to alert VA facilities using VistA 
 Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) that the VBECS 1.6.1 
 server patch is available for immediate installation.
  
 If the VBECS servers are serviced by a second group, (i.e., a Regional 
 Data Center) it is the responsibility of the local IRM support person 
 for VBECS to ensure that all parties who need to take action on this 
 information for 'their' VBECS system see it. The local support should 
 follow local policies to forward such information to their Server 
 Administrators. 
  
 Sites who have not installed VBECS have no action to take with this 
 informational patch.
  
 This patch is released with a thirty (30) day compliance because the 
 patch addresses an issue reported to the Food and Drug Administration 
 (FDA) and Patient Safety. A full description of the patch changes are 
 included in the VBECS 1.6.1 Release Notes.
  
  
 BLOOD BANK CLEARANCE 
 ===================== 
 EFFECT ON BLOOD BANK FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Patch VBEC*1.0*50 contains 
 changes to a package referenced in BBM Team Review of VISTA Patches.
 This patch does not alter or modify any VistA Blood Bank software 
 design safeguards or safety critical elements functions.
  
 RISK ANALYSIS: Changes made by patch VBEC*1.0*50 have no effect on Blood 
 Bank software functionality, therefore RISK is none.
  
  
 VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS: 
 ==========================
 VBECS 1.6.1 server patch requires customer validation in the local 
 Test account prior to installation in Production to meet FDA
 requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank software for its 
 intended use prior to its acceptance and use for patient care. The 
 VBECS 1.6.1 Release Notes contain descriptions of the changes made in 
 this patch and includes validation scenarios.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OIT Field Operations coordinate 
 the installation of the VBECS 1.6.1 server patch with Pathology & 
 Laboratory Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact 
 analysis and testing the changes prior to installation in Production.
