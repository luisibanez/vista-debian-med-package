Subject: UPDATES FOR VBECS 1.6

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 VBEC*1.0*27 is exported as part of the VistA Blood 
 Establishment Computer System (VBECS) Version 1.6.0 release.
  
 VBECS related VistA patches require customer validation in local Test 
 accounts prior to installation in Production to meet Food & Drug 
 Administration (FDA) requirements. The user validates the Blood Bank 
 software for its intended use prior to its acceptance and use for 
 patient care.
  
 Therefore, it is imperative that OIT Field Operations coordinate the 
 installation of Blood Bank software patches with Pathology & Laboratory 
 Medicine Service staff to allow adequate time for impact analysis and 
 testing the changes prior to installation in Production. 
  
 The VBEC*1.0*27 patch, bundled and released with LR*5.2*412, addresses 
 several issues: 
  
  1. 100 VistA MR 082310 (HD 419828) - Fixed an error that was caused by 
     an attempt to file the DFN of the patient in the VBECS DSS EXTRACT
     file (#6002.03). When the DFN matched too many first digits of the 
     SSN's on file it resulted in overloaded memory. The correction 
     forces FileMan to bypass all lookup routines and file the data as 
     presented. 
     No verification required. 
  
  2. 103 VistA MR 042111 (HD 473130) - Fixed an error that caused trailing 
     zeroes to be stored in the DATE/TIME OF TRANSFUSION field (#9) in the 
     VBECS DSS EXTRACT file (#6002.03). This also created an invalid "C" 
     cross reference. The correction removes any trailing zeroes before 
     the data is filed.
     No verification required.
  
  3. 107 VistA MR 072711 - Fixed an error in the Maximum Surgical Blood 
     Order Schedule (MSBOS). Surgeries set as "No blood required" did 
     not present a message to the clinician when blood products were 
     requested. The correction will provide the No blood required 
     information for CPRS to display.
     Verification steps: 
       a) Blood Bank user must define a surgery in the VBECS system as 
          No blood required.
       b) CPRS user with ordering privileges then places an order for 
          Type and Screen and one unit of Red Blood Cells on a test 
          patient. 
       c) CPRS user selects PRE-OP from the Urgency drop down box and 
          selects the Surgery name that was configured by the Blood 
          Bank user (step a.).
       d) A No Blood Required message box displays to the CPRS user 
          informing them that no blood is required for that surgery. The 
          user can click Yes to remove the component order and continue 
          to complete the order, or click No and record a reason for the 
          request in comments.
       e) The verification is successful when the No Blood Required 
          message box displays to the CPRS user. 
  
 There is also a VBECS 1.6.0 server update patch that is also being 
 released. Please refer to the VistA Blood Establishment Computer 
 Software (VBECS) 1.6.0 Release Notes for detailed information 
 about corrections in that patch. These documents will be found in 
 the VBECS_1_6_0_DOCS_BUNDLE.ZIP file.
