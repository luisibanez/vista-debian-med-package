Subject: MILITARY SERVICE DATA SHARING (MSDS)

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 This patch has enhancements to the Veterans Health Information Systems 
 and Technology Architecture (VistA) system to support technology and 
 business changes that are occurring with the implementation of the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) Military Service Data Sharing (MSDS) 
 project.
  
 The MSDS project will introduce an MSDS Broker that will be activated in 
 ESR. The Broker will construct a definitive military service data set 
 including data received from the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), the
 Beneficiary Identification and Records Locator System (BIRLS) and VistA.
 Once the MSDS Broker is activated, ESR becomes the authoritative source
 for Military Service Episode data. The verified data will be shared from
 ESR to all VistA sites of record for the veteran. The ESR-verified
 Military Service Episode data cannot be edited by VistA except to add new
 episodes. An unlimited number of military service episodes per veteran
 will now be supported.
  
 This patch is being released along with patches DG*5.3*797, EAS*1.0*92, 
 DVB*4.0*62, and PXRM*2.0*21 in host file DG_53_P797.KID.
