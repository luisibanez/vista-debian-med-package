Subject: Z05 CHANGES FOR ADD A PERSON

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the 
 Enrollment System Redesign (ESR) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and
 Eligibility (Vista REE) software to support the requirements of the Add a
 Person project.
   
 This patch consists of code changes to address three Code Change Requests 
 (CCRs) for the uploading of data into VistA from the Z05 HL7 message sent 
 from ESR.  The uploading of the data had been a requirement of the ESR 
 3.1/Veterans' Online Application (VOA) project, but due to the discovery 
 of some defects after ESR 3.1/VOA was released, the uploading of the data 
 into VistA was suppressed to mitigate possible data corruption in VistA.  
 The ESR defects have all been corrected and this patch will reinstate the 
 functionality to upload the data from the Z05 as described in the 
 following CCRs:
  
 CodeCR REEG_10441
 Reversal of the VistA code changes from CR 10251 will allow the ORU-Z05 
 ZTA, ZEM, and ZCT segments to file in VistA appropriately based on 
 original requirements identified in the VOA VistA SRS.
  
 CodeCR REEG_10442
 Reversal of the VistA codes changes from CR 10345 will allow the Father's 
 and Mother's Names to be sent on the Z07 to ESR and filed into VistA upon 
 receipt of the Z05 from ESR.  These changes will comply with the original 
 requirements identified in the VOA VistA SRS.  
  
 CodeCR REEG_10443
 Reversal of the VistA code changes from CCR 10346 will allow the 
 veteran's employer name and address to be sent on the Z07 to ESR.  These 
 changes will comply with the original requirements identified in the VOA 
 VistA SRS.  
  
   
  CodeCR Change Requests:  
  -----------------------
  CodeCR REEG_00010441 Reverse CCR 10251 when ESR defect CCRS 10166, 
                         10168, 10221, 10269 and 10299 are fixed
  CodeCR REEG_00010442 Reverse CCR 10345 when ESR defects CCRR 10218 and
                         10300 are corrected
  CodeCR REEG_00010443 Reverse CCR 10346 when ESR defects CCRs 10269 is 
                         fixed
