Subject: DATE OF DEATH UPLOAD ENHANCEMENTS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

 Under current functionality, when an unsolicited demographic transmission 
 (ORU~Z05) containing a Date of Death is received from the Enrollment 
 System (ES), the record is placed into the IVM Demographic Upload Tool 
 for processing via the Demographics Upload [IVM UPLOAD DEM] option. 
 Facility staff evaluates whether to accept or reject the date of death 
 information via their established processes.
  
 This patch, IVM*2*148, provides enhanced data sharing between the 
 Enrollment System (ES) and the Income Verification Matching (IVM) 
 package, as follows:
  
 Automatic upload of Date of Death will occur if ALL of the following 
 conditions are met at the time the message is received and processed by 
 the IVM package:
  
   a.  Date of Death is received by VistA via the Enrollment System (ES), 
       AND
   b.  The Source of Notification is "Death Certificate on File" (internal 
       code of 3), AND
   c.  The Patient is NOT an active inpatient at the time of upload, AND
   d.  VistA does not currently have a Date/Time of Death entry.
  
 Exceptions to the above noted criteria will result in processing of the 
 Date of Death via the Demographics Upload processing [IVM UPLOAD DEM] 
 unless the VistA Date of Death (#.351) field is already populated. If 
 VistA already has a date of death on file, VistA will ignore the Date of 
 Death from ES transmission and will NOT create an entry in the IVM 
 Demographic Upload option.

 CR10787/CCR10780
  
  
 Resolution:
 -----------
  
 A new line tag DODCK, was added to the IVMPREC8 routine to check if a 
 patient currently has the Date of Death (#.351) field populated. if so, 
 it discontinues further processing.
  
 If the Date of Death (#.351) field is null and the data received from the 
 Enrollment System (ES) contains both a Date of Death and Source of 
 Notification equal to "Death Certificate on File" (internal value of 3) 
 upload the data to VistA unless the patient is an active inpatient at the 
 receiving site.
  
 The line tags AUTODOD and AUTOADD in the routine IVMLDEMD were modified 
 to bypass the IVM Demographic Upload tool if the entire previously noted 
 criterion is met for auto upload of Date of Death (#.351) information.
