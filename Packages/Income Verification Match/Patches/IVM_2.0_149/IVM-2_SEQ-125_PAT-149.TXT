  The Health Eligibility Center (HEC) requested modifications to the Enrollment
  System Redesign (ESR) and VistA Registration, Enrollment and Eligibility
  (Vista REE) software to support the requirements of Public Law 111-163.
  On May 5, 2010, the President signed into law, Public Law (PL) 111-163, 
  the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.  This law
  provides assistance to caregivers of Veterans and improves the provisions
  of health care services to Veterans.  Section 511, Prohibitions on
  collections of copayments from Veterans who are Catastrophically
  Disabled.  This patch is being issued in support of some of these
  provisions.
   
  With the installation of this patch and the other related patches,
  DG*5.3*840 and IB*2*449, Veterans who are identified as being
  Catastrophically Disabled will no longer be charged copayments for Means
  Test/Geographic Means Test related Outpatient Visits, Inpatient Visits
  and Outpatient Medications from the effective date of their
  Catastrophically Disabled determination and installation forward.  This
  does not affect Extended Care/Long Term Care Copayments.  These patches
  do not cancel charges created prior to the installation.  Sites should
  continue to use the Chief Business Office guidance they have been
  provided to cancel those previously billed charges where necessary.
