Summary

-------
"BLD",7949,1,6,0)
When My HealtheVet (MHV) Secure Messaging (SM) patients are assigned to
"BLD",7949,1,7,0)
Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) teams other than their Primary Care
"BLD",7949,1,8,0)
provider team, their MHV SM PCMM Primary Care provider association is broken.
"BLD",7949,1,9,0)
This results in MHV SM users not able to send messages to/from their
"BLD",7949,1,10,0)
SM Primary Care team.
"BLD",7949,1,11,0)
     
"BLD",7949,1,12,0)
MHV*1*9 uses a different support PCMM call to always return the patient's
"BLD",7949,1,13,0)
 currently assigned, Primary Care provider.

Detailed Description
"BLD",7949,1,17,0)
--------------------
"BLD",7949,1,18,0)
Secure Messaging allows patients and clinicians to email each other securely
"BLD",7949,1,19,0)
and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those email threads to the
"BLD",7949,1,20,0)
medical record as progress notes.
"BLD",7949,1,21,0)
     
"BLD",7949,1,22,0)
Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
"BLD",7949,1,23,0)
PCMM providers, clinic appointments and Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR)
"BLD",7949,1,24,0)
teams.  Secure Messaging uses triage groups based on these relationships to
"BLD",7949,1,25,0)
manage which patients are able to email which providers.  More information
"BLD",7949,1,26,0)
on Secure Messaging can be found on the MHV product web site
"BLD",7949,1,27,0)

"BLD",7949,1,30,0)
When patients are assigned to other PCMM teams their MHV SM PCMM provider
"BLD",7949,1,31,0)
association is broken.  This results in MHV SM users not able to send messages
"BLD",7949,1,32,0)
to/from their SM Primary Care team.
"BLD",7949,1,33,0)

Before this patch, MHV application routines (MHVXPAT and MHVXDEMS) call,
"BLD",7949,1,35,0)
IA#1916 SCAPMC - SUPPORTED PCMM CALLS, application programmer interface (API)
"BLD",7949,1,36,0)
call to $$PRPT^SCAPMC() to return a patient's Primary Care provider to MHV SM.
"BLD",7949,1,37,0)
This API does not always return the current Primary Care provider.
"BLD",7949,1,38,0)
     
"BLD",7949,1,39,0)
MHV*1*9 patch resolves the issue by always returning the SM patient's Primary Care
"BLD",7949,1,40,0)
provider using the support call, IA#1252 PRIMARY CARE INPUT AND OUTPUT API CALLS,
"BLD",7949,1,41,0)
