Description:
============

  
 MHV*1*9 Secure Messaging
  
 Summary
 -------
 When My HealtheVet (MHV) Secure Messaging (SM) patients are assigned to
 Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) teams other than their Primary Care
 provider team, their MHV SM PCMM primary care provider association is 
 broken.  This results in MHV SM users not able to send messages to/from 
 their SM Primary Care team. MHV*1*9 uses a different support PCMM call to 
 always return the patient's currently assigned, Primary Care provider.
  
  
 Detailed Description
 --------------------
 Secure Messaging allows patients and clinicians to email each other
 securely and confidentially, and allows clinicians to post those
 email threads to the medical record as progress notes.
  
 Relationships between patients and clinicians are established based on
 PCMM providers, clinic appointments and Order Entry/Results Reporting (OE/RR) 
 teams.  Secure Messaging uses triage groups based on these relationships 
 to manage which patients are able to email which providers.  More
 information on Secure Messaging can be found on the MHV Product site
 http://vawwl.va.gov/MyHea1theVet/, and MHV web site www.myhealth.va.gov.
  
 When patients are assigned to other PCMM teams in the electronic VA Medical
 Record, their MHV SM PCMM provider association is broken.  This results in
 MHV SM users not able to send messages to/from their SM Primary Care team.
  
 Before this patch, MHV application routines (MHVXPAT and MHVXDEMS) call, 
 IA#1916 SCAPMC - SUPPORTED PCMM CALLS, Application Programmer Interface 
 (API) call to $$PRPT^SCAPMC() to return a patient's Primary Care provider 
 to MHV SM. This API does not always return the current Primary Care 
 provider.
    
 MHV*1*9 patch resolves the issue by always returning the SM patient's 
 Primary Care provider(s) using the support call, IA#1252 PRIMARY CARE 
 INPUT AND OUTPUT API CALLS, API $$OUTPTPR^SDUTL3().

 Remedy Overview:
 -----------------
 1. HD0000000530122 Secure Message patient association issue
   
 Problem:
 --------
 Secure Message patient association issue.
  
 When linking PCMM Primary care team to Secure Messaging, all of the 
 patient associations are not linking at this site (Butler 529).
 The VISN secure messaging coordinator reports we are the only site with 
 this issue and data will soon be collected to show Secure Messaging 
 Veterans in PCMM only. Secure Messaging allows patient associations with
 PCMM and clinics and our site is utilizing both to capture all
 associations.  One PCMM team is functioning in associating all of the 
 patients but the others are not functioning at all and other associating 
 some patients.
   
 Resolution:
 ------------
 Modified routines MHVXPAT and MHVXDEMS to always return the Primary Care 
 provider.
