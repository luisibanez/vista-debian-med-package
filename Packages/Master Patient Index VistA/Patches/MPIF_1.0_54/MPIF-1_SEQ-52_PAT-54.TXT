Subject: MESSAGING ENHANCEMENTS FOR NEW FIELDS

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*21, MPIF*1.0*46, MPIF*1.0*52, RG*1.0*59, and DG*5.3*837
  are required builds for patch MPIF*1*54.
   
  The messaging enhancements for new fields are being distributed in
  three VistA namespaces.  The patches should be installed in this
  order: DG*5.3*837, RG*1.0*59, and MPIF*1.0*54.  After installing
  DG*5.3*837, it is not necessary to wait for the data conversion
  completion bulletin to move on with installing RG*1.0*59.  It is
  recommended that these three patches be installed within a short
  time window.
   
  Issue #1: Prevent Logging of "Can't Create VTQ" Exceptions
  When the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN
  RES] job found a dangling cross reference, it has been logging a "Can't
  Create VTQ" exception on the MPI.  A code change will now clean up the
  dangling ^DPT("AMPIMIS" cross reference, and therefore prevent the
  logging of the exception each time the job runs.
   
  Issue #2: Stub Record for Patient Entry
  Remedy ticket HD0000000149289 reported that if the patient entry is a
  stub record, then a undefined error can occur at VTQ1+31^MPIFVTQ.
  When an ICN exists for a patient, the MPIZICN variable is set.  In
  the case of a stub record, no ICN exists and the MPIZICN variable
  does not get set.  Variables MPIARR(992) and MPIARR(993) were being
  set by a trigger cross reference, but should not have existed for a
  stub record.  Enhancements were made in routines MPIFRES and MPIFVTQ
  to clean-up dangling data and cross references related to MPI data
  for a stub record.
    
  Issue #3: Remote Procedure Calls for Remote Enumeration
  There are a number of patients at each facility that have not been
  assigned an ICN for a number of reasons, including the fact that they
  are not active patients.  In an effort to support an automated
  enumeration of these remaining patients, two new Remote Procedures
  (RPCs) have been created.
   
  The MPIF REMOTE LOCAL ICN ASSIGN RPC allows local integration
  control numbers (ICNs) to be assigned to a number of patient records.
  This allows them to get a national ICN thru the normal resolution of
  local ICNs via the MPIF LOCAL/MISSING ICN RESOLUTION background job.
   
  The MPIF REMOTE FULL ICN STATS RPC allows the remote MPI user to know
  when the last run of the MPIF REMOTE LOCAL ICN ASSIGN RPC took place,
  the total number of patients with national ICNs, local ICNs, merged
  patients (-9 node in PATIENT (#2) file), and no ICNs.
    
  NOTE:  There is currently no schedule for enumerating the remaining
  records with ICNs.  However, before such a process would begin at
  any facility, an e-mail message will be sent to coordinate the effort.
     
  Issue #4: Prevent Non-Enumerated Record from Updating a More Recent
  Record during the Linking to the New Record
  When an "old" (non-enumerated) record was edited on VistA, it could
  potentially influence Primary View for that record on the MPI, and
  thus update a more recent patient record.  Healthcare Identity
  Management (HC IdM) requests that this scenario be prevented.
    
  When facilities were originally enumerated and records in the PATIENT
  (#2) file were seeded with Integration Control Numbers (ICN), all
  records in the file were not enumerated - only records that were active
  during a three-year time span were enumerated.  Patients added/edited
  after the original seeding also get ICNs, but there are still old,
  inactive records in the PATIENT (#2) file without ICNs.
    
  To prevent an old non-enumerated record from updating a more recent
  record, two VistA patches (RG*1.0*59 and MPIF*1.0*54) and one Master
  Veteran Index patch (MPI*1.0*90) will be issued.  These three patches
  make the following changes:
    
  MPIF*1.0*54 (this patch)
  ------------------------
  - The enumeration builder, remote procedure MPIF REMOTE LOCAL ICN
    ASSIGN, has been enhanced to set the ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn)
    global, if the record with that DFN has no ICN assigned and is not in
    the ^DPT("AMPIMIS",dfn) index indicating it is in the process of being
    assigned an ICN.
    
  - The A31 message builder has been enhanced to check whether ^XTMP("MPIF
    OLD RECORDS",dfn) is defined.  If it is, the record is considered old,
    and the A31 message builder includes an OBX segment in the message:
           OBX^^CE^OLDER RECORD^^Y
          
  - The A31 application acknowledgment processor has been enhanced to kill
    the "old" record designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn), since if
    the traits happen to be the same on the Primary View, no subsequent
    A31 synchronization message will be sent.  Since the Primary View and
    the patient record are in sync, the "old" record designation can be
    removed, and subsequent updates to this record are allowed to update
    the Primary View.
     
  RG*1.0*59
  ---------
  - The A08 message builder has been enhanced to check whether ^XTMP("MPIF
    OLD RECORDS",dfn) is defined.  If it is, the record is considered old,
    and the A08 message builder includes an OBX segment in the message:
           OBX^^CE^OLDER RECORD^^Y
    
  - The A08 application acknowledgment processor has been enhanced to kill
    the "old" record designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn), since if
    the traits happen to be the same on the Primary View, no subsequent A31
    synchronization message will be sent.  Since the Primary View and the
    patient record are in sync, the "old" record designation can be 
    removed, and subsequent updates to this record are allowed to update
    the Primary View.
      
  - The A31 message processor has been enhanced to kill the "old" record
    designator, ^XTMP("MPIF OLD RECORDS",dfn).  If the MPI sends an update
    message, the VistA record and the Primary View are in sync, and the
    "old" record designation can be removed.
      
  MPI*1.0*90 (patch is ONLY installed on the MPI)
  -----------------------------------------------
  - The patch will check whether the incoming A31 or A08 message contains
    an OBX segment marking the record as "old".  If it does, then the
    authority score for the patient will be considered -1, and thus not
    influence the Primary View.
   
  Issue #5: Correction for a Subscript Error
  When a patient is added and the real-time connection to the MPI returns
  an ICN without a CMOR, then a subscript error occurs at NS+1^XUAF4.
  A call is made at RDT+13^MPIFQ0 to get the internal entry number of
  the CMOR, and the error occurs because of the null CMOR value.  Because
  a CMOR value might not be passed from the MPI, this error is corrected in
  routine MPIFQ0 by checking that the CMOR has a value before making the
  call to get the internal entry number.
   
  Issue #6: Obsolete Code
  Unused and unnecessary code in routines MPIFA31I and MPIFA43 was commented
  out.  The obsolete code was related to checks in the TREATING FACILITY LIST
  (#391.91) file.

  Post-Install Routine:
  =====================
  There is only one entry in the MPI ICN BUILD MANAGEMENT (#984.8) file,
  and the file is used to store the start date, end date, last record
  processed, etc.  Post install routine, MPIFP54, resets the one node
  of the MPI ICN BUILD MANAGEMENT (#984.8) file to remove the data from
  previous usage, in order to store data related to the running of the
  MPIF REMOTE LOCAL ICN ASSIGN RPC.  The MPIFP54 routine is automatically
  deleted after the post-init runs.
