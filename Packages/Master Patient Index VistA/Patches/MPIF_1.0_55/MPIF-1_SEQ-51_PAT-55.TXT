Subject: SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  Patch MPIF*1*55 contains elements to support and enhance VA IdM
  (Identity Management) service communication with the National Health
  Information Network (NHIN).  The NHIN can be thought of as the 'parent'
  gateway that communicates with the Master Patient Index (MPI) on behalf
  of its National Health Information Exchange (NHIE) 'children'.  The
  NHIN project has systems that interact with the VA NHIN adapter to
  search for patients.  On behalf of these systems, NHIN will communicate
  with the MPI and serve as an interpreter for the NHIE.  Some of NHINS
  facilities include Kaiser Permanente, the Department of Defense,
  MedVirginia, and the Consumer Preference and Policy System (CPP).
   
  Patch MPIF*1*55 will enhance the capability of VA IdM to support the
  HL7v3.0 formatted Fully Qualified IDs.  This effort will align the
  data perspective to support all four elements of the HL7 v2.4 standard
  PID-3 Identifier sequence as well as the larger HL7 v3.0 formatted
  unique Source IDs.
   
  Extensive information for the PID-3 Identifier sequence can be
  found in the Master Patient Index/Patient Demographics (MPI/PD),
  HL7 Interface Specifications document, available on the VistA
  Documentation Library (VDL).
   
  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*48, MPIF*1.0*51, and MPIF*1.0*52 are required builds for patch
  MPIF*1*55.
   
  Issue #1
  On the Master Patient Index (MPI) the Health Care Identity Management
  (HC IdM) team reported an exception in the Exception Handler from
  the VistA Blood Establishment Computer Software (VBECS) application.
  The MPI does not directly communicate with this application.  The
  exception occurred due to a VBECS protocol which was added as a
  subscriber to the VistA MPIF ADT-A40 SERVER event protocol. When the
  VBECS application returned an application acknowledgement error, the
  MPI logged an exception in the CIRN HL7 EXCEPTION LOG (#991.1) file.
   
  To correct this problem, and prevent an exception from being logged,
  routine MPIFA40 was modified.  It will check that the sending and
  receiving application in the application acknowledgement are both
  'MPIF TRIGGER'.  If one or both are not, then the application
  acknowledgement is being sent from a non-MPI application and should
  be ignored.
    
  Issue #2
  HC IdM reported that ALIAS SSN is not included as a prompt when the
  ALIAS data is entered using the PIMS Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD
  PATIENT DATA], Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] and Electronic
  10-10EZ Processing [EAS EZ 1010EZ PROCESSING] options for a new patient.
  They requested that the ALIAS SSN prompt be asked immediately after an
  ALIAS is entered via any of these options.  Routine MPIFAPI has been
  enhanced to include this data.
    
  Issue #3
  HC IdM requested that when the Add Verified Duplicate Pair [XDR
  ADD VERIFIED DUPS] option is used on VistA, that a check be made to the
  MPI DO NOT LINK (#985.28) file on the MPI to ensure that the records
  have not already been identified as a DO NOT LINK pairing.  This change
  is made in routine MPIFDNL which is called by the Add Verified Duplicate
  Pair option to invoke the MPI EVENT LIST remote procedure.
  
  If you add a record pair to the DUPLICATE RECORD file (#15) via the Add 
  Verified Duplicate Pair option and mark the pair as VERIFIED, NOT A 
  DUPLICATE, the record pair was added to the MPI DO NOT LINK file 
  (#983.85), but the user's division, the value stored in DUZ(2), was 
  stored in the ASSIGNING LOCATION and DNL ASSIGNING LOCATION fields. The 
  fields should be set to the primary station number of the sending site 
  instead.
    
  Issue #4
  The Display Only Query [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY TO MPI] option allows
  the VistA user to query the Master Patient Index (MPI) in Austin for
  all known data about a patient.  If the Social Security Number is not
  supplied or is not available for the search, then Display Only Query
  does not return a complete list of potential matches from the MPI.
  This occurs because the number used for comparison on the MPI is a high
  number.  This number is stored in the TASK THRESHOLD (#10.1) field of
  the MPI PARAMETER (#985.1) file.  A new field has been added to this MPI
  file called ATTENDED SEARCH THRESHOLD (#10.5).  It defines a lower
  threshold number to be used by the Display Only Query to improve the
  search results.  The values established for these two threshold fields
  was determined by HC IdM.  Code changes have been made in routine MPIFSA2
  to use the enhanced search values now available on the MPI.
     
  NOTE: Issues 3 and 4 will only occur on VistA when the MPI patch,
  MPI*1.0*84 has been installed on the Master Patient Index in Austin.

  Installation Instructions:
  ==========================
  This patch takes less than 2 minutes to install.  This patch should
  be loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to the users.
   
  1.  Users are allowed on the system during patch installation.
     
  2.  The HL7 incoming filers should be stopped.  Use the Monitor,
      Start, Stop Filers [HL FILER MONITOR] option on the Filer and
      Link Management Options [HL MENU FILER LINK MGT] menu on the
      HL7 Main Menu [HL MAIN MENU].
     
  3.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.
      Note:  TEXT PRINT/DISPLAY option in the PackMan menu will display
      the patch text only.
     
  4.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System Menu, select
      the Installation menu.
