Subject: VIC 4.0 AND DOD CAC MPI INTEGRATION/HWSC

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch provides the functionality needed to interface VHA VistA 
 software to the MVI for Primary View (PV) lookup and data retrieval 
 during registration of a Veteran using the new Veteran Identification 
 Card (VIC 4.0) and the Department of Defense's Common Access Card (CAC).
  
 MPIF software will provide the interface using HealtheVet Web Services 
 (HWSC) to obtain initial patient information when a patient has never been
 treated at the local VA facility and their VIC 4.0 card is swiped or 
 scanned or their CAC card is swiped during the registration process.  This
 VistA-to-MVI interface will send and parse eXtensible Markup Language
 (XML) messages.
  
 NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy systems to 
 avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as Treating Facilities.
  
 MPIF*1.0*54 and MPIF*1.0*55 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*56.
   
 Issue:  Using the Load/Edit Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] option, 
 an issue was found where auto linking a patient to a mismatched patient 
 was not creating a correlation on the Master Patient Index (MPI). This 
 was due to the Health Level Seven (HL7) A24 link message not being sent 
 to the MPI.  We found that the mismatched patient with the new ICN did 
 not have the COORDINATING MASTER OF RECORD (#991.03) field populated in 
 VistA.  The existing code in MPIFQ0 was quitting if COORDINATING MASTER 
 OF RECORD was not set up and not sending the A24 to the MPI.
 Solution:  Routine MPIFQ0 was modified so it does not quit, but instead 
 will fall through the code to send the A24 to the MPI.
  
 This patch is being distributed as a ZIP file that contains the necessary 
 files for installation.  Sites should refer to the install guide for 
 installation instructions.
  
 Patch Information:
 MPIF_1_56.zip includes the components necessary for the interface that
 will be used:
         MPIF_1_56.KID (contains MPIF*1*56)
         PSIMWSEXECUTE.WSDL
         MPIF_1_56IG.PDF
  
 This patch (MPIF*1.0*56) provides the interface that will be used by the 
 registration updates being distributed separately in the standalone 
 DG*5.3*857 patch. It provides all the software and tools necessary to 
 complete the setup of the interface, which must be done prior to interface
 being fully functional.
