Subject: PATIENT RECORD FLAG SUPPORT

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  MPIF*1.0*52 and DG*5.3*864 are required builds for patch MPIF*1*58.
   
  Issue #1
  A code change has been made in routine MPIFBT3 to support the Patient
  Record Flag initiative distributed in VistA patch DG*5.3*864.
    
  For some time the Register a Patient [DG REGISTER PATIENT] and Load/Edit
  Patient Data [DG LOAD PATIENT DATA] options have included the query for
  the Patient Record Flag.  However, when a patient is created outside of
  these options, the query for the Patient Record Flag was not occurring.
  Also, if a patient does not get an Integration Control Number (ICN) via
  the direct connect to the Master Veteran Index during registration, that
  record gets a local ICN.  The local ICN is resolved to a national ICN
  through the Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS
  ICN RES] option.
    
  The Local/Missing ICN Resolution Background Job [MPIF LOC/MIS ICN RES]
  now includes the query for the Patient Record Flag.
