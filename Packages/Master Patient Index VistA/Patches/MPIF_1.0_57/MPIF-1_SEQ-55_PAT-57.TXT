Subject: MASTER VETERAN INDEX VISTA ISSUES - ITERATION 10

Category: 
  - Routine
  - Enhancement (Mandatory)

Description:
============

  NOTE:  RG* and MPIF* patches should NOT be installed on legacy
  systems to avoid issues with the legacy systems ending up as
  Treating Facilities.
   
  DG*5.3*863, MPIF*1.0*20, and MPIF*1.0*55 are required builds for
  patch MPIF*1*57.
   
  NOTE: Patches DG*5.3*863, RG*1*60, and MPIF*1*57 are being released
  together.  It is recommended that all three patches be installed on
  the same date if possible.  Each patch contains functionality related
  to the display of the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  All
  three patches must be in place nationally for the full ICN to display
  in all of the stated options.
    
  Issue #1
  Changes have been made to address Remedy ticket HD0000000707771.  Code
  that used EN1^XWB2HL7 to invoke a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) to the
  Master Veteran Index (MVI) or another remote system used RTNDATA^XWBDRPC
  instead of RPCCHK^XWB2HL7 to check the status of the call.  The result
  is that even though the check is performed in a loop multiple times,
  if results do not come back by the first check, subsequent checks would
  never succeed, and the RPC call would appear to fail.  The code was
  modified and refactored to use RPCCHK^XWB2HL7 instead of RTNDATA^XWBDRPC
  to check the status of the RPC call.
   
  Issue #2
  The Display Only Query [Display Only Query [MPIF DISPLAY ONLY QUERY
  TO MPI] option on the Message Exception Menu [RG EXCEPTION MENU] will
  now display the full INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER (ICN).  The full ICN
  includes the PATIENT (#2) file INTEGRATION CONTROL NUMBER
  (991.01) field, followed by a "V", followed by the ICN CHECKSUM
  (991.02) field, and is retrieved by calling the GETICN^MPIF001 API.
           
  Documentation Update:
  =====================
  The following MASTER PATIENT INDEX/PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS (MPI/PD)
  VISTA documentation is available, updated for patches DG*5.3*863,
  MPIF*1.0*57, and RG*1.0*60.  Facilities should download the revised
  documentation listed as follows:
