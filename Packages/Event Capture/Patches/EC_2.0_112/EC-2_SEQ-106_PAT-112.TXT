Subject: Event Capture FY12 Updates

Category: 
  - Data Dictionary
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Decision Support System (DSS) Program office requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2012.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1)  Bug - Incorrect inactive associated clinic values.
  
     The following options allow the use of an inactive default associated
     clinic.  The software has been modified to force the use of an active 
     clinic.
  
     Data Entry by Patient
     Data Entry by Procedure
     Data Entry Multiple Dates/Multiple Procedures
  
 2)  Bug - Broker error causes use of a random associated clinic in the 
     Data Entry by Patient option.
  
     The software has been modified so that if a broker error occurs during
     the process, the Associated Clinic is cleared and the user is notified
     of the error and instructed to enter the Associated Clinic.
     
 3)  Bug - Enforce DSS unit user access rules.
  
     When entering event capture from Computerized Patient Record 
     System (CPRS) it is possible to be granted DSS unit access
     incorrectly. The software has been updated so that DSS unit access is
     correctly applied to the user regardless of how access is gained.
  
 4)  Bug - Unable to select user when more than one user has the same name.
  
     When using the Grant Access to DSS Units option, if a user selects a 
     name from the list when a duplicate exists for that name, the 
     selected name is not retained.  The software has been modified to 
     provide additional identifiers so that the correct name can be chosen 
     and will now retain the selection when made.
  
 5)  Create a new maintenance option called Identify/Inactivate Multiple 
     Event Code Screens.
  
     This new option will allow users to select an Event Capture product 
     code and then display all of the DSS units using the selected product 
     code in an event code screen.  Users may then choose to inactivate 
     event code screens.
  
 6)  Modify software to allow for up to 3 reasons per procedure entered.
  
     The EVENT CAPTURE PATIENT (#721) file was modified to capture two 
     additional procedure reasons. The Procedure Reason #2 (#43) and
     Procedure Reason #3 (#44) fields were added. In addition, the
     following options were modified to support the collection and display
     of those additional reasons.
  
     Data Entry by Patient
     Data Entry by Procedure
     Multiple Dates/Multiple Procedures
     Patient Summary Report
     Procedure Reasons Report
  
     The following report will no longer show reasons.
  
     Provider 1-7 Summary Report
  
 7)  Modify grant access to DSS units screen to allow printing.
  
     The software will be modified so that the list of users identified as 
     having access to a given DSS unit can be printed.
  
 8)  Modify Event Code screen option so print and export buttons are no 
     longer grayed out.
  
     The software will be modified so that the print and export buttons 
     will now be functional on this screen.
  
 9)  Modify Event Capture GUI so that it can be minimized.
  
     The Event Capture software will be modified so that the application 
     can be minimized on any screen, minimizing all open screens, and 
     retaining correct focus when application is maximized.
  
 10) Create a security key to restrict access to Event Capture reports.
  
     A reverse security key, ECNORPT, will be created so that users that
     are assigned this key will not be allowed to access the Event Capture
     reports.
  
 11) Create a new report called Event Capture Encounter Report.
  
     A new report will be created that will display and count the unique 
     occurrences by patient and DSS unit across a selected time frame.  It 
     will allow sorting by patient or provider.
  
 12) Modify reports so that only the last 4 of the Social Security 
     Number (SSN) show.
  
     The following reports have been modified so that only the last 4 of 
     the SSN show, rather than the full SSN.
  
     DSS Unit Activity Report
     Provider 1-7 Summary Report
  
 13) Create a new report called Event Code Screens With Inactive Default 
     Associated Clinic.
  
     A new report will be added that will allow you to identify one, many 
     or all DSS units and then display all event code screens that 
     currently have an inactive default associated clinic.
  
 14) Create a new report called DSS Units/Event Code (EC) Screens for
     Selected Procedure Code Report.
  
     A new report will be added that will list all DSS units with event 
     code screens containing a selected procedure code.

 Installation Instructions
 ========================= 
  
 ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE ***************************
 This patch updates the software version number of both the VistA
 server software and the Event Capture client GUI to version 2.1.3.4
 GUI client versions prior to version 2.1.3.4 are not compatible with 
 the VistA server software for this patch.  Therefore, it is crucial
 that the Event Capture client GUI distributed with this patch be
 installed immediately following the VistA server software install
 to minimize service disruption to the Event Capture System users.
  
 Pre-Installation Items:
 =======================
  
 * Environment Check:
      
   Programmer access is required for installing this patch.
  
   ** NOTE ** -- Prior to installation, the installer must ensure the  
                 DUZ(0) node of the DUZ array is set to the "@" symbol.
   
 * Users On the System:
    
   This patch modifies routines used by the Event Capture application and
   may affect many users.
  
   This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
   loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
   reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
   If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
   following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
   descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
   the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
         EC GUI Context version 2.1.3.3   ... EC GUI CONTEXT
    
 * Software Installation Time:
  
   The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off peak
   hours.
  
 * Required Builds:
    
   The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
   distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
   without their prior installation.
