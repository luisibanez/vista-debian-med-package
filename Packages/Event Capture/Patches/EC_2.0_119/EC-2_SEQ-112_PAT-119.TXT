Subject: Event Capture FY13 Updates

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 The Decision Support System (DSS) Program office requests modifications to
 the Event Capture System that would provide the field with improved data
 entry capabilities so that accurate costing information can be gathered
 nationally.  This patch contains the modifications for Fiscal Year 2013.
  
 Functional Overview
 ===================
  
 1) Remove Procedure Reason data entry from Event Code Screen setup.  
  
    Reasons and event code screens are no longer linked together.  When
    entering data, all reasons will be available for selection if the event
    code screen allows reasons.  When setting up event code screens, users
    no longer need to identify specific reasons to be associated with
    the event code screen.
  
 2) Create menu option on management menu for entering values into the
    Procedure Reason file.
  
    For holders of the ECMGR key, there will be a new option called Reasons
    on the management menu.  This option will allow you to add new reasons
    as well as activate and inactivate existing reasons.
  
 3) Modify reason selection to allow for entry by letter.
  
    On data entry screens where reasons can be entered, the user may now
    select reasons by entering the starting letter or letters of the 
    reason they'd like to select.  For example, if the reason list 
    contains 3 reasons that start with the letter K, you may enter K in the
    reason field to get to the first entry that starts with K.  For each
    additional letter typed, the list will automatically take you to the
    first matching entry.  This functionality is in addition to the
    existing selection functionality using the down chevron.
  
 4) On dual monitor setups, screens open up across both monitors.
  
    Code has been changed so that when a user has dual monitors, new
    screens open up on the main monitor.
  
 5) Modify "now" and "midnight" buttons to return hours and minutes only.
  
    Code has been changed so that when a user hits the "now" or "midnight"
    button when entering time related data, only the hours and minutes are
    returned.  Seconds are dropped from the time selection as this was
    causing issues when linking to scheduled appointments.
  
 6) Correct inactive default associated clinic in event code screen setup.
  
    This change was previously added for users doing data entry but was 
    not correctly applied during event code screen setup on the management
    menu.  Code has been updated so that if an event code screen has an
    inactive default clinic, the default associated clinic will be deleted
    and the user will receive a warning indicating that the default
    associated clinic is inactive and that they must either leave 
    the field blank or select another clinic.
  
 7) Add ability to copy event code screens to a DSS unit.
  
    Managers will now have an option to copy event code screens from an
    existing DSS unit to another DSS unit.  Users may copy one, some, or 
    all of the screens and may change certain fields during the copy 
    process.  The screens are to be copied one at a time, to assist with 
    accuracy.
  
    During the coding of this requirement, it was discovered that lowercase
    letters are allowed in DSS unit names. Use of lowercase letters causes
    problems with retrieval and editing later and should not be allowed.
    Lowercase letters are no longer allowed and a post-install routine
    will review existing entries and convert them to uppercase where
    possible.  The installer of the patch will receive an email upon
    completion of the post-install identifying all entries that were
    updated, along with any entries that couldn't be updated due to
    creation of a duplicate.  For entries not automatically converted, the
    site will need to update those entries to all uppercase manually.
  
 8) Make all ECS reports exportable to Excel.
  
    All reports on the reports menu can now be exported to Excel.
  
 The following defects are also addressed in this patch.
  
 1) When using the 'Data Entry by Procedure' option, for multiple 
    diagnoses with multiple patients in batch entry, a patient would be
    assigned an incorrect diagnosis.
  
    Problem:
    --------
    The 'Diagnosis' field is saving the same diagnosis for multiple
    patients when they actually have different diagnoses.  When a second
    encounter is added for a patient, the original diagnosis populates. If
    the user does not click in the field, the diagnosis is not saved.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    Modified 'UfrmEditProcPatients2.pas' to correctly save a default 
    diagnosis without user interaction.
  
 2) The 'Data Entry by Patient' "Add" button will not work for users 
    with only 1 Decision Support Systems (DSS) Unit, when launching Event
    Capture via Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS).
  
    Problem:
    --------
    When Event Capture is launched via CPRS and the user only has 1 DSS 
    unit assigned, the "Add" button will not properly initialize unless the
    "DSS Unit" dropdown is clicked.
  
    Resolution:
    -----------
    The file 'UfrmPatientProcDE.pas' has been modified to properly 
    initialize the "Add" button when Event Capture is launched via CPRS.
  
 Remedy Ticket(s) & Overview:
 ----------------------------
  
 Remedy Ticket #464081 and duplicate ticket #622913 - Batch entry 
 diagnoses on first entry then converts to all patients in the batch.
  
 Remedy Ticket #498189 and duplicate tickets #499418 and #502928 - event 
 capture interface after patch 109.
  
 Remedy Ticket #614541 - Cannot assign default clinic.
  
 Remedy Ticket #624690 and duplicate ticket #624861 -Inactive default 
 associated clinics can cause problems on the management data entry 
 screens. Default Associated Clinic changing to the next active clinic,
 alphabetically.

 Installation Instructions
 ========================= 
  
 ********************* IMPORTANT NOTE ***************************
 This patch updates the software version number of both the VistA
 server software and the Event Capture client GUI to version 2.1.3.5
 GUI client versions prior to version 2.1.3.5 are not compatible with 
 the VistA server software for this patch.  Therefore, it is crucial
 that the Event Capture client GUI distributed with this patch be
 installed immediately following the VistA server software install
 to minimize service disruption to the Event Capture System users.
  
 Pre-Installation Items:
 =======================
  
 * Environment Check:
      
   Programmer access is required for installing this patch.
  
   ** NOTE ** -- Prior to installation, the installer must ensure the  
                 DUZ(0) node of the DUZ array is set to the "@" symbol.
   
 * Users On the System:
    
   This patch modifies routines used by the Event Capture application and
   may affect many users.
  
   This patch may be installed with users on the system, but should be
   loaded during non-peak hours to minimize disruption to users and to
   reduce the possibility of errors when the routines are updated.
  
   If installed during the normal workday, it is recommended that the
   following selection(s) in the OPTION (#19) file, and all of their
   descendants be disabled to prevent possible conflicts while running
   the KIDS Install. Other VISTA users will not be affected.
  
         EC GUI Context version 2.1.3.4   ... EC GUI CONTEXT
    
 * Software Installation Time:
  
   The estimated installation time is less than 5 minutes during off peak
   hours.
  
 * Required Builds:
    
   The following is a list of REQUIRED builds for this KIDS
   distribution.  KIDS will not allow the installation of this patch
   without their prior installation.
  
   Required Build(s):
   ------------------
   EC*2*112
   EC*2*108
   EC*2*69
  
 Post-Install Items:
 ===================
  
 **PLEASE NOTE**
 A post-install routine will run that will check to see if there are any
 DSS unit names that contain lowercase letters.  If any are found, they 
 will be converted to all uppercase as long as this conversion doesn't 
 create a duplicate entry.  Upon completion of the post-install an email 
 message will be sent to the installer indicating any DSS units that were 
 updated as well as any that were not updated due to the creation of a 
 duplicate entry.  If any entries could not be updated, the site will have 
 to manually fix those entries.
