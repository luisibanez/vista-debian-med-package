    (2) After the updates to the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725) file are
        made, the patch performs an inspection of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS
        (#720.3) file. Any active EC EVENT CODE SCREENS (#720.3) file
        record which points to an inactive EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE (#725)
        file record will be identified. The results of the inspection are
        placed in a MailMan message and sent to the user that performed
        the patch installation.
  
  
 Example of the MailMan message:
 -------------------------------
     Please forward this message to your local DSS Site Manager or
     Event Capture ADPAC.
   
     A review of the EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) was done
     after installation of patch EC*2*113 which updated the EC NATIONAL
     PROCEDURE file (#725).  This message provides the results of that
     review.
   
     The EC EVENT CODE SCREENS file (#720.3) records indicated below
     point to an inactive record in the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE file
     (#725).
     The user should use the Event Code Screen option in the Event Capture
     GUI to inactivate the Event Code Screen.  If necessary, a new
     Event Code Screen can be created using a currently active CPT code
     or National Procedure.
   
  
  
 ===========================================================================
 Note: The new EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers could exist in some site's
 environment. If the EC NATIONAL PROCEDURE Numbers exist, then the system
 will add the new numbers and it will keep what the sites have on file. In
 addition, a message similar to the one below will be printed during
 installation: 
   
 "Entry #3457 for 97001 REFER/CONS/SCREEN [CPT: 97001] (RC001)  ...
 successfully added. Your site has a local procedure 90002 in
