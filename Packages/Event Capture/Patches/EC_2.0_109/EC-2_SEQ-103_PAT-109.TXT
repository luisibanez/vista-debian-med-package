Subject: TIMEOUT, AUTO-POPULATE LOCATION, AND EXIT SCREEN FIXES

Category: 
  - Routine

Description:
============

 This patch will resolve issues with an Event Capture timeout when started from
 CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), Event Capture's exit screen, Event
 Capture not auto-populating the user's last used location, and it will clean up
 the ^XTMP global used by Event Capture to store user's last used information.  
  
 ****************************Please Note*********************************** 
  
 Please make sure that the previous Event Capture patch (EC*2.0*108) has been
 installed into the VistA server side before proceeding with this patch.

  REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW: 
  =====================
  1) HD0000000436683  Location is not auto-populating for user 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When entering Event Capture from CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), 
  the user has noticed that one's last used location at a multi-division site 
  is not being inputted automatically.  This is functionality that was to be 
  placed in Event Capture with EC*2.0*100.  The problem is that when using 
  Event Capture from CPRS it is not saving the user's last used 
  information, and therefore is not working as intended.  
  
  Solution: 
  ---------
  The GUI has been updated so that the Last Used information for a user 
  will be saved off for later use.  
    
  2) HD0000000444094  Event Capture Issue 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  When entering Event Capture from CPRS (Computerized Patient Record System), 
  the timeout setting is only 2 minutes.  This issue was reported to be 
  fixed in EC*2.0*72 as setting the timeout to the CPRS setting.  
  
  Solution: 
  ---------
  Corrected the GUI to set the timeout to the CPRS setting, if none is 
  specified, then the default will be 5 minutes.  We also fixed the timeout 
  itself, which was not correctly closing out of Event Capture.  
  
  3) HD0000000448513  Broker Error after canceling exit attempt 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  In Event Capture GUI, if a user hits the Exit button on the main menu, 
  but then clicks cancel instead of ok, the broker session will be 
  disconnected and will show multiple broker errors when trying to use EC.  
  
  Solution: 
  ---------
  Fix the GUI so that if the user would like to continue using the EC 
  program instead of Exiting, then they will be allowed to without having 
  to re-sign in.  
  
  4) HD0000000437260  XTMP Global keeps growing 
     (d)HD0000000455855  XTMP global keeps filling up with "ECOBUF" nodes 
   
  Problem: 
  --------
  The ^XTMP global subscripted with "ECOBUF" is growing out of control and 
  is never being cleaned up by Event Capture.  This happens only when the 
  user enters Event Capture through the CPRS Tools menu option for Event 
  Capture Interface.  
  
  Solution: 
  ---------
  The fix to save off the user's last used information (#1) will also 
  resolve this issue with the ^XTMP growing out of control.  Also, the 
  pre-install routine, ECP109PT, will clean up the existing ^XTMP 
  subscripted with "ECOBUF" in order to restore some memory to sites.  
  
  
  INSTALLATION 
  ============
  VistA Server Side: 
  ------------------
  Use the following instructions in installing this server-side EC*2.0*109 
  patch.  Installation should take less than 1 minute.  
  
         1.  Use the INSTALL/CHECK MESSAGE option on the PackMan menu.  
  
         2.  Users ARE allowed to be on the system during the 
             installation, but you should select a time when minimal number 
             of users are on.  
      
         3.  From the Kernel Installation and Distribution System (KIDS) 
             Menu, select the Installation menu.  
   
         4.  From this menu, you may elect to use the following options 
             (when prompted for INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*109): 
                 a.  Backup a Transport Global.  
                 b.  Compare Transport Global to Current System.  
                 c.  Verify Checksums in Transport Global 
  
         5.  Use the Install Packages option (when prompted for the 
             INSTALL NAME, enter EC*2.0*109).  
  
         6.  When prompted 'Want KIDS to INHIBIT LOGONs during the 
             INSTALL? NO//', respond "NO".  
  
         7.  When prompted 'Want to DISABLE Scheduled Options, Menu 
             Options, and Protocols? YES//', respond "YES".  
  
          Enter options you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': 
           EC GUI Context version 2.1.3.3    [EC GUI CONTEXT] 
  
          Enter protocols you wish to mark as 'Out Of Order': 
  
         8.  If prompted 'Delay Install (Minutes):  (0-60): 0//; 
             respond "0". 
  
         9.  The routine ECP109PT will be removed from your production system
             after the patch has been successfully installed.
   
  
  Client Side: 
  ------------
  
         1.  Retrieve the GUI zip file.  The name of the zip file is 
   
                EC_2_109.ZIP 
   
       Sites can retrieve VistA software from the following FTP addresses.  
       The preferred method is to FTP the files from 
   
            download.vista.med.va.gov 
   
       This will transmit the files from the first available FTP server.  
       Sites may also elect to retrieve software directly from a specific 
       server as follows 
   
            Albany                  ftp.fo-albany.med.va.gov 
            Hines                   ftp.fo-hines.med.va.gov 
            Salt Lake City          ftp.fo-slc.med.va.gov 
   
       The EC_2_109.ZIP zip file is located in the anonymous.software 
       directory.  Use BINARY Mode when downloading the file.  
  
         2.  Open the file EC_2_109.ZIP.  Check to make sure the size is 
             correct (ECS GUI.exe - 2403 KB) 
  
         3.  Extract the ECS GUI.exe file to the folder where the existing 
             Event Capture executable is installed. The usual location of 
             the Event Capture executable is: 
  
                     C:\Program Files\Vista\ECS GUI 
    
         4.  When asked to overwrite the existing file, answer Yes.  
   
         5.  Following successful extraction of the executable, the 
             EC_2_109.ZIP file may be deleted.
