  2. CCR2953 - On a Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR)
               encounter, the immunity
               status was not being updated to immune by titer for measles 
               and rubella when a positive titer has a titer performed date
               on or before the vaccination administration date or vaccine
               previously received date, therefore the disease immunity  
               table on the print cumulative vaccination record was not 
               displaying measles and rubella as immune by titer.

               display the date that the declination was signed.
