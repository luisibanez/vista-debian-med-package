 REMEDY TICKET OVERVIEW:
 =======================
 1. HD0000000059366 - <UNDEFINED>EXIT^LBRYRPT
  
  
 Problem:
 ========
  
 An undefined error occurs when subsequently running certain reports from the 
 'Serials Title Reports.' or 'Other Serials Reports.' menu and then using a 
 (^) to exit. The following reports will cause the error:
  
 Serials Titles Reports [STR] menu:
  
                         [Missing Issues List]
                         [All Serials Titles]
                         [Local Titles by Location]
                         [Local Titles by Vendor]
                         [Local Microfilm Titles]
  
 Other Serials Reports [OSR] menu:
  
                         [Titles Due for Renewal]    
                         [Local Gaps List]
                         [Outstanding Routed to Return Issues] 
                         [List of Recipients]
                         [For-your-information titles]
  
 The routine LBRYRPT checks the value of "IOT", at line tag EXIT to determine 
 the device type. The next line, EXIT+1, kills the system variable "IOT". Upon
 running the routine again, the variable IOT is undefined.
  
  
 Resolution:
 ===========
 The routine LBRYRPT has been modified by changing the line EXIT+1 to
 prevent the variable "IOT" from being killed. As per the Standards and
 Conventions Committee (SACC) guidelines 2.3.1.6, system variables
 beginning in "IO" should not be modified.
