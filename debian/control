Description: package for VistA EHR
 VistA: the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture.
 This is an integrated health information system that was developed by
 employees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Therefore, the
 large majority of the source code in VistA is in the Public Domain.
 In 2011, the VA set up an Open Source custodial organization (OSEHRA)
 to develop an open source environment for VistA. OSEHRA adopted the
 Apache 2.0 License for all subsequent contributions to be integrated
 with the VisA code base.
 .
 VistA is implemented in M/MUMPS, and on Linux depends on the GT.M
 compiler and database being available.
